0,"TO THE READER This is a first book, and in it the author has written of experience which is now far and lost, but which was once part of the fabric of his life. If any reader, therefore, should say that the book is ""autobiographical"" the writer has no answer for him: it seems to him that all serious work in fiction is autobiographical-- that, for instance, a more autobiographical work than ""Gulliver's Travels"" cannot easily be imagined.",1
7,"The seed of our destruction will blossom in the desert, the alexin of our cure grows by a mountain rock, and our lives are haunted by a Georgia slattern, because a London cut-purse went unhung. Each moment is the fruit of forty thousand years. The minute-winning days, like flies, buzz home to death, and every moment is a window on all time.",1
13,"He set up business in Sydney, the little capital city of one of the middle Southern states, lived soberly and industriously under the attentive eye of a folk still raw with defeat and hostility, and finally, his good name founded and admission won, he married a gaunt tubercular spinstress, ten years his elder, but with a nest egg and an unshakable will to matrimony. Within eighteen months he was a howling maniac again, his little business went smash while his foot stayed on the polished rail, and Cynthia, his wife--whose life, the natives said, he had not helped to prolong--died suddenly one night after a hemorrhage. So, all was gone again--Cynthia, the shop, the hard-bought praise of soberness, the angel's head--he walked through the streets at dark, yelling his pentameter curse at Rebel ways, and all their indolence; but sick with fear and loss and penitence, he wilted under the town's reproving stare, becoming convinced, as the flesh wasted on his own gaunt frame, that Cynthia's scourge was doing vengeance now on him.",1
16,"So, alone and lost again, having found neither order nor establishment in the world, and with the earth cut away from his feet, Oliver resumed his aimless drift along the continent. He turned westward toward the great fortress of the hills, knowing that behind them his evil fame would not be known, and hoping that he might find in them isolation, a new life, and recovered health. The eyes of the gaunt spectre darkened again, as they had in his youth.",1
17,"All day, under a wet gray sky of October, Oliver rode westward across the mighty state. As he stared mournfully out the window at the great raw land so sparsely tilled by the futile and occasional little farms, which seemed to have made only little grubbing patches in the wilderness, his heart went cold and leaden in him. He thought of the great barns of Pennsylvania, the ripe bending of golden grain, the plenty, the order, the clean thrift of the people. And he thought of how he had set out to get order and position for himself, and of the rioting confusion of his life, the blot and blur of years, and the red waste of his youth.",1
22,"The next morning he resumed his journey by coach. His destination was the little town of Altamont, twenty-four miles away beyond the rim of the great outer wall of the hills. As the horses strained slowly up the mountain road Oliver's spirit lifted a little. It was a gray-golden day in late October, bright and windy. There was a sharp bite and sparkle in the mountain air: the range soared above him, close, immense, clean, and barren. The trees rose gaunt and stark: they were almost leafless. The sky was full of windy white rags of cloud; a thick blade of mist washed slowly around the rampart of a mountain.",1
23,"Below him a mountain stream foamed down its rocky bed, and he could see little dots of men laying the track that would coil across the hill toward Altamont. Then the sweating team lipped the gulch of the mountain, and, among soaring and lordly ranges that melted away in purple mist, they began the slow descent toward the high plateau on which the town of Altamont was built. In the haunting eternity of these mountains, rimmed in their enormous cup, he found sprawled out on its hundred hills and hollows a town of four thousand people.",1
26,"And then the marvellous hill Spring came, green-golden, with brief spurting winds, the magic and fragrance of the blossoms, warm gusts of balsam. The great wound in Oliver began to heal. His voice was heard in the land once more, there were purple flashes of the old rhetoric, the ghost of the old eagerness.",1
27,"One day in April, as with fresh awakened senses, he stood before his shop, watching the flurry of life in the square, Oliver heard behind him the voice of a man who was passing. And that voice, flat, drawling, complacent, touched with sudden light a picture that had lain dead in him for twenty years. Hit's a comin'!  Accordin' to my figgers hit's due June 11, 1886. Oliver turned and saw retreating the burly persuasive figure of the prophet he had last seen vanishing down the dusty road that led to Gettysburg and Armageddon.",1
29,"That's Bacchus Pentland,"" he said. He's quite a character. There are a lot of his folks around here. Oliver wet his great thumb briefly.",1
37,"Why, yes,"" said Eliza, nodding smartly, ""as the fellow says, you can read poetry for the good of your soul and Larkin for the good of your body. I like poetry,"" said Gant, thumbing over the pages, and pausing with interest at the section marked Songs of the Spur and Sabre. In my boyhood I could recite it by the hour. He bought the books.",1
38,"Eliza packed her samples, and stood up looking sharply and curiously about the dusty little shop. Doing any business?"" she said. Very little,"" said Oliver sadly. Hardly enough to keep body and soul together. I'm a stranger in a strange land. Pshaw!"" said Eliza cheerfully.",1
39,"You ought to get out and meet more people. You need something to take your mind off yourself. If I were you, I'd pitch right in and take an interest in the town's progress. We've got everything here it takes to make a big town--scenery, climate, and natural resources, and we all ought to work together. If I had a few thousand dollars I know what I'd do,""--she winked smartly at him, and began to speak with a curiously masculine gesture of the hand--forefinger extended, fist loosely clenched. Do you see this corner here--the one you're on? It'll double in value in the next few years. Now, here! she gestured before her with the loose masculine gesture. They're going to run a street through there some day as sure as you live. And when they do--"" she pursed her lips reflectively, ""that property is going to be worth money. She continued to talk about property with a strange meditative hunger.",1
40,"The town seemed to be an enormous blueprint to her: her head was stuffed uncannily with figures and estimates--who owned a lot, who sold it, the sale-price, the real value, the future value, first and second mortgages, and so on. When she had finished, Oliver said with the emphasis of strong aversion, thinking of Sydney:  ""I hope I never own another piece of property as long as I live-- save a house to live in. It is nothing but a curse and a care, and the tax-collector gets it all in the end. Eliza looked at him with a startled expression, as if he had uttered a damnable heresy.",1
41,"Why, say! That's no way to talk! she said. You want to lay something by for a rainy day, don't you?""  ""I'm having my rainy day now,"" he said gloomily.",1
47,"Major Thomas Pentland was the father of a numerous family of which Eliza was the only surviving girl. A younger sister had died a few years before of a disease which the family identified sorrowfully as ""poor Jane's scrofula. There were six boys:  Henry, the oldest, was now thirty, Will was twenty-six, Jim was twenty-two, and Thaddeus, Elmer and Greeley were, in the order named, eighteen, fifteen, and eleven. Eliza was twenty-four.",1
49,"Father,"" Eliza had said with ladylike dignity, as she led Oliver for the first time into the sitting-room of the cottage, ""I want you to meet Mr. Gant.""  Major Pentland rose slowly from his rocker by the fire, folded a large knife, and put the apple he had been peeling on the mantel. Bacchus looked up benevolently from a whittled stick, and Will, glancing up from his stubby nails which he was paring as usual, greeted the visitor with a birdlike nod and wink. The men amused themselves constantly with pocket knives.",1
51,"Yes,"" said Oliver, ""that's right. From what Eliza's been telling me about you,"" said the Major, giving the signal to his audience, ""I was going to say it ought to be L. E. Gant. The room sounded with the fat pleased laughter of the Pentlands.",1
52,"Whew!"" cried Eliza, putting her hand to the wing of her broad nose. I'll vow, father! You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Gant grinned with a thin false painting of mirth.",1
53,"The miserable old scoundrel, he thought. He's had that one bottled up for a week. You've met Will before,"" said Eliza.",1
54,"Both before and aft,"" said Will with a smart wink. When their laughter had died down, Eliza said:  ""And this--as the fellow says--is Uncle Bacchus. Yes, sir,"" said Bacchus beaming, ""as large as life an' twice as sassy.",1
55,"They call him Back-us everywhere else,"" said Will, including them all in a brisk wink, ""but here in the family we call him Behind- us. I suppose,"" said Major Pentland deliberately, ""that you've served on a great many juries?""  ""No,"" said Oliver, determined to endure the worst now with a frozen grin. Why?""  ""Because,"" said the Major looking around again, ""I thought you were a fellow who'd done a lot of COURTIN'.",1
56,"Then, amid their laughter, the door opened, and several of the others came in--Eliza's mother, a plain worn Scotchwoman, and Jim, a ruddy porcine young fellow, his father's beardless twin, and Thaddeus, mild, ruddy, brown of hair and eye, bovine, and finally Greeley, the youngest, a boy with lapping idiot grins, full of strange squealing noises at which they laughed. He was eleven, degenerate, weak, scrofulous, but his white moist hands could draw from a violin music that had in it something unearthly and untaught. And as they sat there in the hot little room with its warm odor of mellowing apples, the vast winds howled down from the hills, there was a roaring in the pines, remote and demented, the bare boughs clashed. And as they peeled, or pared, or whittled, their talk slid from its rude jocularity to death and burial: they drawled monotonously, with evil hunger, their gossip of destiny, and of men but newly lain in the earth. And as their talk wore on, and Gant heard the spectre moan of the wind, he was entombed in loss and darkness, and his soul plunged downward in the pit of night, for he saw that he must die a stranger--that all, all but these triumphant Pentlands, who banqueted on death--must die.",1
57,"And like a man who is perishing in the polar night, he thought of the rich meadows of his youth: the corn, the plum tree, and ripe grain. Why here? O lost!    2   Oliver married Eliza in May.",1
60,"For him the house was the picture of his soul, the garment of his will. But for Eliza it was a piece of property, whose value she shrewdly appraised, a beginning for her hoard. Like all the older children of Major Pentland she had, since her twentieth year, begun the slow accretion of land: from the savings of her small wage as teacher and book-agent, she had already purchased one or two pieces of earth. On one of these, a small lot at the edge of the public square, she persuaded him to build a shop. This he did with his own hands, and the labor of two negro men: it was a two-story shack of brick, with wide wooden steps, leading down to the square from a marble porch. Upon this porch, flanking the wooden doors, he placed some marbles; by the door, he put the heavy simpering figure of an angel.",1
64,"In eleven years she bore him nine children of whom six lived. The first, a girl, died in her twentieth month, of infant cholera; two more died at birth. The others outlived the grim and casual littering. The oldest, a boy, was born in 1885. He was given the name of Steve. The second, born fifteen months later, was a girl-- Daisy. The next, likewise a girl--Helen--came three years later. Then, in 1892, came twins--boys--to whom Gant, always with a zest for politics, gave the names of Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison. And the last, Luke, was born two years later, in 1894.",1
69,"As she lay in her bed, a great star burned across her vision in the western quarter of the sky; she fancied it was climbing heaven slowly. And although she could not have said toward what pinnacle her life was moving, she saw in the future freedom that she had never known, possession and power and wealth, the desire for which was mixed inextinguishably with the current of her blood. Thinking of this in the dark, she pursed her lips with thoughtful satisfaction, unhumorously seeing herself at work in the carnival, taking away quite easily from the hands of folly what it had never known how to keep.",1
70,"I'll get it! she thought, ""I'll get it. Will has it! Jim has it. And I'm smarter than they are. And with regret, tinctured with pain and bitterness, she thought of Gant:  ""Pshaw!",1
76,and we was alone in a privy. Is she gone yet? There was vast whisky laughter.,1
78,"Will Pentland was in Loughran's when she entered. She did not greet him. When she had gone he turned to a man near him, prefacing his remark with a birdlike nod and wink:  ""Bet you can't do that,"" he said.",1
82,"Timid Daisy, pale from fright, would have fled to the neighboring arms of Sudie Isaacs, or to the Tarkintons; Helen, aged ten, even then his delight, would master him, feeding spoonfuls of scalding soup into his mouth, and slapping him sharply with her small hand when he became recalcitrant. You DRINK this! You better! He was enormously pleased: they were both strung on the same wires.",1
83,"Again, he was beyond all reason. Extravagantly mad, he built roaring fires in his sitting-room, drenching the leaping fire with a can of oil; spitting exultantly into the answering roar, and striking up, until he was exhausted, a profane chant, set to a few recurrent bars of music, which ran, for forty minutes, somewhat like this:        ""O-ho--Goddam,       Goddam, Goddam,       O-ho--Goddam,       Goddam--Goddam. --adopting usually the measure by which clock-chimes strike out the hour.",1
87,"At eight o'clock Gant returned alone. The boy Steve had stayed at home for ready dispatch at Eliza's need; for the moment the attention was shifted from the master. His great voice below, chanting obscenities, carried across the neighborhood: as she heard the sudden wild roar of flame up the chimney, shaking the house in its flight, she called Steve to her side, tensely:  ""Son, he'll burn us all up! she whispered.",1
96,"Come quick! she whispered. Come quick!""  ""By God, I'll kill her,"" Gant screamed, plunging down the stairs at greater peril to his own life than to any other.",1
99,"I think he meant it that time,"" she whispered. Duncan shut the door against the gaping line of neighbors beyond the gate. Ye'll be gettin' a cheel like that, Mrs. Gant. Keep him away from me!",1
107,"Mr. Gant!"" pleaded Jannadeau. What's the matter with you, W. O.?"" asked Will Pentland, looking up innocently from his fingers. Had something to eat that didn't agree with you?""--he winked pertly at Duncan, and went back to his fingers.",1
109,"But I'll tell you something about him, W. O.,"" he continued after a moment, with calm but boding judiciousness. He let his wife die a natural death in her own bed. He didn't try to kill her. No, by God!"" Gant rejoined.",1
111,"Old Major Pentland never did an honest day's work in his life,"" Gant yelled, as a happy afterthought. Come now, Mr. Gant!"" said Duncan reproachfully. Hush!  Hush!"" whispered the girl fiercely, coming before him closely with the soup. She thrust a smoking ladle at his mouth, but he turned his head away to hurl another insult. She slapped him sharply across the mouth.",1
113,"Will Pentland looked at the girl attentively for a moment, then glanced at Duncan and Jannadeau with a nod and wink. Without saying another word, he left the room, and mounted the stairs. His sister lay quietly extended on her back.",1
120,"As he descended the tall veranda steps, Duncan and Jannadeau came quietly down the yard from the sitting-room. How's W. O.?"" he asked. Ah, he'll be all right now,"" said Duncan cheerfully. He's fast asleep. The sleep of the righteous?"" asked Will Pentland with a wink.",1
126,"They won't let us in. But Doctor Cardiac came out and told us if we were good he might bring us a little boy. There was a terrific clatter on the tin roof, the scolding country voice of the nurse: Steve dropped like a cat from the porch roof to the lily bed outside Gant's window.",1
130,"My wife! Oh, baby, say that you forgive me! He went up the stairs, sobbing laboriously.",1
133,"You get away from here! And she slammed it violently in his face. He went downstairs with hang-dog head, but he grinned slyly as he thought of the nurse's answer. He wet his big thumb quickly on his tongue.",1
143,"Sometimes, pulling himself abreast the high walls of his crib, he glanced down dizzily at the patterns of the carpet far below; the world swam in and out of his mind like a tide, now printing its whole sharp picture for an instant, again ebbing out dimly and sleepily, while he pieced the puzzle of sensation together bit by bit, seeing only the dancing fire-sheen on the poker, hearing then the elfin clucking of the sun-warm hens, somewhere beyond in a distant and enchanted world. Again, he heard their morning-wakeful crowing dear and loud, suddenly becoming a substantial and alert citizen of life; or, going and coming in alternate waves of fantasy and fact, he heard the loud, faery thunder of Daisy's parlor music. Years later, he heard it again, a door opened in his brain: she told him it was Paderewski's ""Minuet.",1
145,"Holding them clumsily in his tiny hands, he studied for hours the symbols of speech, knowing that he had here the stones of the temple of language, and striving desperately to find the key that would draw order and intelligence from this anarchy. Great voices soared far above him, vast shapes came and went, lifting him to dizzy heights, depositing him with exhaustless strength. The bell rang under the sea.",1
151,"For two hours since their return from church, the little boys had been prowling hungrily around the kitchen: Ben, frowning proudly, kept his dignity outside the screen, making excursions frequently through the house to watch the progress of cookery; Grover came in and watched with frank interest until he was driven out; Luke, his broad humorous little face split by a wide exultant smile, rushed through the house, squealing exultantly:        ""Weenie, weedie, weeky,       Weenie, weedie, weeky,       Weenie, weedie, weeky,       Wee, Wee, Wee. He had heard Daisy and Josephine Brown doing Cæsar together, and his chant was his own interpretation of Cæsar's brief boast: ""Veni, Vidi, Vici. As Eugene lay in his crib, he heard through the open door the dining-room clatter, the shrill excitement of the boys, the clangor of steel and knife as Gant prepared to carve the roast, the reception of the morning's great event told over and over without variation, but with increasing zest.",1
154,"He was conscious of sunlight, rain, the leaping fire, his crib, the grim jail of winter: the second Spring, one warm day, he saw Daisy go off to school up the hill: it was the end of the noon recess, she had been home for lunch. She went to Miss Ford's School For Girls; it was a red brick residence on the corner at the top of the steep hill: he watched her join Eleanor Duncan just below. Her hair was braided in two long hanks down her back: she was demure, shy, maidenly, a timid and blushing girl; but he feared her attentions to him, for she bathed him furiously, wreaking whatever was explosive and violent beneath her placidity upon his hide. She really scrubbed him almost raw. He howled piteously. As she climbed the hill, he remembered her. He saw she was the same person.",1
157,"Mr. Hilliard's house was considered one of the finest residences in the town. The neighborhood was middle-class, but the situation was magnificent, and the Hilliards carried on in the grand manner, lords of the castle who descended into the village, but did not mix with its people. All of their friends arrived by carriage from afar; every day punctually at two o'clock, an old liveried negro drove briskly up the winding alley behind two sleek brown mares, waiting under the carriage entrance at the side until his master and mistress should come out. Five minutes later they drove out, and were gone for two hours.",1
158,"This ritual, followed closely from his father's sitting-room window, fascinated Eugene for years after: the people and the life next door were crudely and symbolically above him. He felt a great satisfaction that morning in being at length in Hilliard's alley: it was his first escape, and it had been made into a forbidden and enhaloed region. He grubbed about in the middle of the road, disappointed in the quality of the cinders. The booming courthouse bell struck eleven times.",1
169,"He was inwardly sore at the abuse Gant heaped on him; he was not insensitive to his faults, but to be called a ""good-for-nothing bum,"" ""a worthless degenerate,"" ""a pool-room loafer,"" hardened his outward manner of swagger defiance. Cheaply and flashily dressed, with peg-top yellow shoes, flaring striped trousers, and a broad- brimmed straw hat with a colored band, he would walk down the avenue with a preposterous lurch, and a smile of strained assurance on his face, saluting with servile cordiality all who would notice him. And if a man of property greeted him, his lacerated but overgrown vanity would seize the crumb, and he would boast pitifully at home:  ""They all know Little Stevie! He's got the respect of all the big men in this town, all right, all right! Every one has a good word for Little Stevie except his own people. Do you know what J. T. Collins said to me to-day? What say?",1
170,"Who's that? Who's that?"" asked Eliza with comic rapidity, looking up from her darning. J. T. Collins--that's who! He's only worth about two hundred thousand. 'Steve,' he said, just like that, 'if I had your brains'""--He would continue in this way with moody self- satisfaction, painting a picture of future success when all who scorned him now would flock to his standard.",1
172,"I'll vow,"" Eliza fretted, ""I don't know what's to become of that boy. It was the tragic flaw of her temperament to get to the vital point too late: she pursed her lips thoughtfully, wandered off in another direction, and wept when misfortune came. She always waited. Moreover, in her deepest heart, she had an affection for her oldest son, which, if it was not greater, was at least different in kind from what she bore for the others. His glib boastfulness, his pitiable brag, pleased her: they were to her indications of his ""smartness,"" and she often infuriated her two studious girls by praising them. Thus, looking at a specimen of his handwriting, she would say:  ""There's one thing sure: he writes a better hand than any of the rest of you, for all your schooling.",1
174,"One day, Steve forged a check on his father. It was some days before Gant discovered it: the amount was only three dollars, but his anger was bitter. In a pronouncement at home, delivered loudly enough to publish the boy's offense to the neighborhood, he spoke of the penitentiary, of letting him go to jail, of being disgraced in his old age--a period of his life at which he had not yet arrived, but which he used to his advantage in times of strife.",1
175,"He paid the check, of course, but another name--that of ""forger""-- was added to the vocabulary of his abuse. Steve sneaked in and out of the house, eating his meals alone for several days. When he met his father little was said by either: behind the hard angry glaze of their eyes, they both looked depthlessly into each other; they knew that they could withhold nothing from each other, that the same sores festered in each, the same hungers and desires, the same crawling appetites polluted their blood. And knowing this, something in each of them turned away in grievous shame.",1
180,"At times, when she tried to reply to his attack, she would burst easily into tears. This pleased him: he liked to see her cry. But usually she made an occasional nagging retort: deep down, between their blind antagonistic souls, an ugly and desperate war was being waged. Yet, had he known to what lengths these daily assaults might drive her, he would have been astounded: they were part of the deep and feverish discontent of his spirit, the rooted instinct to have an object for his abuse.",1
181,"Moreover, his own feeling for order was so great that he had a passionate aversion for what was slovenly, disorderly, diffuse. He was goaded to actual fury at times when he saw how carefully she saved bits of old string, empty cans and bottles, paper, trash of every description: the mania for acquisition, as yet an undeveloped madness in Eliza, enraged him. In God's name! he would cry with genuine anger. In God's name! Why don't you get rid of some of this junk? And he would move destructively toward it.",1
182,"No you don't, Mr. Gant! she would answer sharply. You never know when those things will come in handy. It was, perhaps, a reversal of custom that the deep-hungering spirit of quest belonged to the one with the greatest love of order, the most pious regard for ritual, who wove into a pattern even his daily tirades of abuse, and that the sprawling blot of chaos, animated by one all-mastering desire for possession, belonged to the practical, the daily person.",1
183,"Gant had the passion of the true wanderer, of him who wanders from a fixed point. He needed the order and the dependence of a home-- he was intensely a family man: their clustered warmth and strength about him was life. After his punctual morning tirade at Eliza, he went about the rousing of the slumbering children. Comically, he could not endure feeling, in the morning, that he was the only one awake and about.",1
191,"Do you know what? she began thoughtfully one night, as she laid down the paper, ""I've a good notion to pack up and go. Go?  Go where?""  ""To Saint Louis,"" she answered.",1
194,"Merciful God, Mrs. Gant! he howled tragically, ""you surely wouldn't do a thing like that. I beg you not to. Why, pshaw, Mr. Gant, don't be such a fool.",1
199,"In early April, Eliza departed, bearing her excited brood about her, and carrying Eugene in her arms. He was bewildered at this rapid commotion, but he was electric with curiosity and activity. The Tarkintons and Duncans streamed in: there were tears and kisses. Mrs. Tarkinton regarded her with some awe. The whole neighborhood was a bit bewildered at this latest turn.",1
201,"There's no place like Altamont. They went to the station in the street-car: Ben and Grover gleefully sat together, guarding a big luncheon hamper. Helen clutched nervously a bundle of packages. Eliza glanced sharply at her long straight legs and thought of the half-fare.",1
205,"They had an awkward moment. The strangeness, the absurdity of the whole project, and the monstrous fumbling of all life, held them speechless. Well,"" he began, ""I reckon you know what you're doing. Well, I tell you,"" she said, pursing her lips, and looking out the window, ""you don't know what may come out of this.",1
230,"The undertakers put the body in a basket and took it away. He was just twelve years and twenty days old,"" said Eliza over and over, and this fact seemed to trouble her more than any other. You children go and get some sleep now,"" she commanded suddenly and, as she spoke, her eye fell on Ben who stood puzzled and scowling, gazing in with his curious old-man's look. She thought of the severance of the twins; they had entered life within twenty minutes of each other; her heart was gripped with pity at the thought of the boy's loneliness. She wept anew. The children went to bed. For some time Eliza and Gant continued to sit alone in the room. Gant leaned his face in his powerful hands. The best boy I had,"" he muttered. By God, he was the best of the lot.",1
234,"They went home immediately. At every station Gant and Eliza made restless expeditions to the baggage-car. It was gray autumnal November: the mountain forests were quilted with dry brown leaves. They blew about the streets of Altamont, they were deep in lane and gutter, they scampered dryly along before the wind.",1
241,"Gant lavished upon it his abuse, his affection, and his prodigal provisioning. They came to look forward eagerly to his entrance, for he brought with him the great gusto of living, of ritual. They would watch him in the evening as he turned the corner below with eager strides, follow carefully the processional of his movements from the time he flung his provisions upon the kitchen table to the re-kindling of his fire, with which he was always at odds when he entered, and on to which he poured wood, coal and kerosene lavishly. This done, he would remove his coat and wash himself at the basin vigorously, rubbing his great hands across his shaven, tough-bearded face with the cleansing and male sound of sandpaper. Then he would thrust his body against the door jamb and scratch his back energetically by moving it violently to and fro. This done, he would empty another half can of kerosene on the howling flame, lunging savagely at it, and muttering to himself.",1
243,"But, during that winter, as death, assaulted by the quick and healing gaiety of children, those absolute little gods of the moment, lifted itself slowly out of their hearts, something like hopefulness returned to her. They were a life unto themselves--how lonely they were they did not know, but they were known to every one and friended by almost no one. Their status was singular--if they could have been distinguished by caste, they would probably have been called middle-class, but the Duncans, the Tarkintons, all their neighbors, and all their acquaintances throughout the town, never drew in to them, never came into the strange rich color of their lives, because they had twisted the design of all orderly life, because there was in them a mad, original, disturbing quality which they did not suspect. And companionship with the elect-- those like the Hilliards--was equally impossible, even if they had had the gift or the desire for it. But they hadn't.",1
250,"Yes, it does look pretty bad,"" she would remark. And then:  ""It's a pity you didn't listen to me last summer, Mr. Gant, when we had a chance of trading in that worthless old Owenby place for those two houses on Carter Street. We could have been getting forty dollars a month rent on them ever since. I never want to own another foot of land as long as I live,"" he yelled.",1
253,"Gant, for all his hatred of land ownership, was proud of living under his own shelter, and indeed proud in the possession of anything that was sanctified by his usage, and that gave him comfort. He would have liked ready and unencumbered affluence--the possession of huge sums of money in the bank and in his pocket, the freedom to travel grandly, to go before the world spaciously. He liked to carry large sums of money in his pocket, a practice of which Eliza disapproved, and for which she reprimanded him frequently. Once or twice, when he was drunk, he had been robbed: he would brandish a roll of bills about under the stimulation of whisky, and dispense large sums to his children--ten, twenty, fifty dollars to each, with maudlin injunctions to ""take it all! Take it all, God damn it! But next day he was equally assiduous in his demands for its return: Helen usually collected it from the sometimes unwilling fingers of the boys. She would give it to him next day. She was fifteen or sixteen years old, and almost six feet high: a tall thin girl, with large hands and feet, big-boned, generous features, behind which the hysteria of constant excitement lurked.",1
259,"Seated before a roast or a fowl, Gant began a heavy clangor on his steel and carving knife, distributing thereafter Gargantuan portions to each plate. Eugene feasted from a high chair by his father's side, filled his distending belly until it was drum-tight, and was permitted to stop eating by his watchful sire only when his stomach was impregnable to the heavy prod of Gant's big finger. There's a soft place there,"" he would roar, and he would cover the scoured plate of his infant son with another heavy slab of beef. That their machinery withstood this hammer-handed treatment was a tribute to their vitality and Eliza's cookery.",1
260,"Gant ate ravenously and without caution. He was immoderately fond of fish, and he invariably choked upon a bone while eating it. This happened hundreds of times, but each time he would look up suddenly with a howl of agony and terror, groaning and crying out strongly while a half-dozen hands pounded violently on his back.",1
262,"Why on earth don't you watch what you're doing? If you didn't eat so fast you wouldn't always get choked. The children, staring, but relieved, settled slowly back in their places.",1
266,"How looked the home-earth then to Gant the Far-Wanderer? Light crept grayly, melting on the rocky river, the engine smoke streaked out on dawn like a cold breath, the hills were big, but nearer, nearer than he thought. And Altamont lay gray and withered in the hills, a bleak mean wintry dot. He stepped carefully down in squalid Toytown, noting that everything was low, near, and shrunken as he made his Gulliverian entry. He had a roof-and-gulley high conviction; with careful tucked-in elbows he weighted down the heated Toytown street-car, staring painfully at the dirty pasteboard pebbledash of the Pisgah Hotel, the brick and board cheap warehouses of Depot Street, the rusty clapboard flimsiness of the Florence (Railway Men's) Hotel, quaking with beef-fed harlotry.",1
268,"His sallow face, thin-flanked, was hang-dog and afraid. He stared wistful-sullenly down at the rattan seat as the car screeched round into the switch at the cut and stopped; the motorman, smoke- throated, slid the door back and entered with his handle. He closed the door and sat down yawning.",1
272,"Pneumonia,"" said the motorman. He was dead four days after he was took down. Why, he was a big healthy man in the prime of life,"" said Gant.",1
273,"I was talking to him the day before I went away,"" he lied, convincing himself permanently that this was true. He looked as if he had never known a day's sickness in his life. He went home one Friday night with a chill,"" said the motorman, ""and the next Tuesday he was gone.",1
274,There was a crescent humming on the rails. With his thick glove finger he pushed away a clearing in the window-coated ice scurf and looked smokily out on the raw red cut-bank. The other car appeared abruptly at the end of the cut and curved with a skreeking jerk into the switch.,1
277,"A gracious friend from us is gone,       A voice we loved is fled,       But faith and memory lead us on:       He lives; he is not dead. Four cents a letter. Little enough, God knows, for the work you do. My letters the best. Could have been a writer. Like to draw too. And all of mine! I would have heard if anything--he would have told me. I'll never go that way. All right above the waist. If anything happens it will be down below. Eaten away. Whisky holes through all your guts. Pictures in Cardiac's office of man with cancer. But several doctors have to agree on it. Criminal offense if they don't. But, if worst comes to worst--all that's outside. Get it before it gets up in you. Still live. Old man Haight had a flap in his belly. Ladled it out in a cup. McGuire-- damned butcher. But he can do anything. Cut off a piece here, sew it on there. Made the Hominy man a nose with a piece of shinbone. Couldn't tell it. Ought to be possible. Cut all the strings, tie them up again. While you wait. Sort of job for McGuire--rough and ready. They'll do it some day. After I'm gone. Things standing thus, unknown--but kill you maybe. Bull's too big. Soon now the Spring. You'd die. Not big enough. All bloody in her brain. Full filling fountains of bull-milk. Jupiter and what's-her-name.",1
278,"But westward now he caught a glimpse of Pisgah and the western range. It was more spacious there. The hills climbed sunward to the sun. There was width to the eye, a smoking sun-hazed amplitude, the world convoluting and opening into the world, hill and plain, into the west. The West for desire, the East for home. To the east the short near mile-away hills reeked protectively above the town. Birdseye, Sunset. A straight plume of smoke coiled thickly from Judge Buck Sevier's smut-white clapboard residence on the decent side of Pisgah Avenue, thin smoke-wisps rose from the nigger shacks in the ravine below. Breakfast. Fried brains and eggs with streaky rashers of limp bacon. Wake, wake, wake, you mountain grills! Sleeps she yet, wrapped dirtily in three old wrappers in stale, airless yellow-shaded cold. The chapped hands sick-sweet glycerined. Gum-headed bottles, hairpins, and the bits of string. No one may enter now. Ashamed.",1
282,"The car still climbing, mounted the flimsy cheap-boarded brown-gray smuttiness of Skyland Avenue. America's Switzerland. The Beautiful Land of the Sky. Jesus God! Old Bowman said he'll be a rich man some day. Built up all the way to Pasadena. Come on out. Too late now. Think he was in love with her. No matter. Too old. Wants her out there. No fool like--White bellies of the fish. A spring somewhere to wash me through. Clean as a baby once more. New Orleans, the night Jim Corbett knocked out John L. Sullivan. The man who tried to rob me. My clothes and my watch. Five blocks down Canal Street in my nightgown. Two A.M.  Threw them all in a heap--watch landed on top. Fight in my room. Town full of crooks and pickpockets for prizefight. Make good story. Policeman half hour later. They come out and beg you to come in. Frenchwomen. Creoles. Beautiful Creole heiress. Steamboat race. Captain, they are gaining. I will not be beaten. Out of wood. Use the bacon she said proudly. There was a terrific explosion. He got her as she sank the third time and swam to shore. They powder in front of the window, smacking their lips at you. For old men better maybe. Who gets the business there? Bury them all above ground. Water two feet down. Rots them. Why not? All big jobs. Italy. Carrara and Rome. Yet Brutus is an hon-or-able man. What's a Creole? French and Spanish. Has she any nigger blood? Ask Cardiac?",1
286,"Anchored to earth at last, he was hit suddenly by the whole cumulation of sight and movement, of eating, drinking, and acting that had gathered in him for two months. The limitless land, wood, field, hill, prairie, desert, mountain, the coast rushing away below his eyes, the ground that swam before his eyes at stations, the remembered ghosts of gumbo, oysters, huge Frisco seasteaks, tropical fruits swarmed with the infinite life, the ceaseless pullulation of the sea. Here only, in his unreal-reality, this unnatural vision of what he had known for twenty years, did life lose its movement, change, color.",1
291,"He went down the hill, opening his iron gate softly, and going around to the side entrance by the yard, rather than ascend the steep veranda steps. The grape vines, tough and barren, writhed about the house like sinewy ropes. He entered the sitting-room quietly. There was a strong odor of cold leather. Cold ashes were strewn thinly in the grate. He put his bag down and went back through the wash-room into the kitchen. Eliza, wearing one of his old coats, and a pair of fingerless woollen gloves, poked among the embers of a crawling little fire.",1
292,"Well, I'm back,"" Gant said. Why, what on earth! she cried as he knew she would, becoming flustered and moving her arms indeterminately. He laid his hand clumsily on her shoulder for a moment. They stood awkwardly without movement. Then he seized the oil-can, and drenched the wood with kerosene. The flame roared up out of the stove.",1
302,"He had won his first release from the fences of home--he was not quite six, when, of his own insistence, he went to school. Eliza did not want him to go, but his only close companion, Max Isaacs, a year his senior, was going, and there was in his heart a constricting terror that he would be left alone again. She told him he could not go: she felt, somehow, that school began the slow, the final loosening of the cords that held them together, but as she saw him slide craftily out the gate one morning in September and run at top speed to the corner where the other little boy was waiting, she did nothing to bring him back. Something taut snapped in her; she remembered his furtive backward glance, and she wept. And she did not weep for herself, but for him: the hour after his birth she had looked in his dark eyes and had seen something that would brood there eternally, she knew, unfathomable wells of remote and intangible loneliness: she knew that in her dark and sorrowful womb a stranger had come to life, fed by the lost communications of eternity, his own ghost, haunter of his own house, lonely to himself and to the world. O lost.",1
306,"answered Gant furiously. Now, I want to tell you,"" she went on thoughtfully, speaking with her forefinger, ""folks have always said that his grandfather would have made a fine scholar if--""  ""Merciful God!"" said Gant, getting up suddenly and striding about the room with an ironical laugh. I might have known that it would come to this! You may be sure,"" he exclaimed in high excitement, wetting his thumb briefly on his tongue, ""that if there's any credit to be given I won't get it. Not from you! You'd rather die than admit it! No, but I'll tell you what you will do! You'll brag about that miserable old freak who never did a hard day's work in his life. Now, I wouldn't be so sure of that if I were you,"" Eliza began, her lips working rapidly.",1
311,"Yes, and the exciting smell of chalk and varnished desks; the smell of heavy bread-sandwiches of cold fried meat and butter; the smell of new leather in a saddler's shop, or of a warm leather chair; of honey and of unground coffee; of barrelled sweet-pickles and cheese and all the fragrant compost of the grocer's; the smell of stored apples in the cellar, and of orchard-apple smells, of pressed-cider pulp; of pears ripening on a sunny shelf, and of ripe cherries stewing with sugar on hot stoves before preserving; the smell of whittled wood, of all young lumber, of sawdust and shavings; of peaches stuck with cloves and pickled in brandy; of pine-sap, and green pine-needles; of a horse's pared hoof; of chestnuts roasting, of bowls of nuts and raisins; of hot cracklin, and of young roast pork; of butter and cinnamon melting on hot candied yams. Yes, and of the rank slow river, and of tomatoes rotten on the vine; the smell of rain-wet plums and boiling quinces; of rotten lily-pads; and of foul weeds rotting in green marsh scum; and the exquisite smell of the South, clean but funky, like a big woman; of soaking trees and the earth after heavy rain. Yes, and the smell of hot daisy-fields in the morning; of melted puddling-iron in a foundry; the winter smell of horse-warm stables and smoking dung; of old oak and walnut; and the butcher's smell of meat, of strong slaughtered lamb, plump gouty liver, ground pasty sausages, and red beef; and of brown sugar melted with slivered bitter chocolate; and of crushed mint leaves, and of a wet lilac bush; of magnolia beneath the heavy moon, of dogwood and laurel; of an old caked pipe and Bourbon rye, aged in kegs of charred oak; the sharp smell of tobacco; of carbolic and nitric acids; the coarse true smell of a dog; of old imprisoned books; and the cool fern- smell near springs; of vanilla in cake-dough; and of cloven ponderous cheeses.",1
312,"Yes, and of a hardware store, but mostly the good smell of nails; of the developing chemicals in a photographer's dark-room; and the young-life smell of paint and turpentine; of buckwheat batter and black sorghum; and of a negro and his horse, together; of boiling fudge; the brine smell of pickling vats; and the lush undergrowth smell of southern hills; of a slimy oyster-can, of chilled gutted fish; of a hot kitchen negress; of kerosene and linoleum; of sarsaparilla and guavas; and of ripe autumn persimmons; and the smell of the wind and the rain; and of the acrid thunder; of cold starlight, and the brittle-bladed frozen grass; of fog and the misted winter sun; of seed-time, bloom, and mellow dropping harvest. And now, whetted intemperately by what he had felt, he began, at school, in that fecund romance, the geography, to breathe the mixed odors of the earth, sensing in every squat keg piled on a pier-head a treasure of golden rum, rich port, fat Burgundy; smelling the jungle growth of the tropics, the heavy odor of plantations, the salt-fish smell of harbors, voyaging in the vast, enchanting, but unperplexing world. Now the innumerable archipelago had been threaded, and he stood, firm-planted, upon the unknown but waiting continent.",1
321,"The class squirmed: the little boys invented tortures or scrawled obscenities to the little girls. And the wilder and more indolent seized every chance of leaving the room, thus:  ""Teacher, may I be excused? And they would go out into the lavatory, sniggering and dawdling about restlessly.",1
324,"At school, he was a desperate and hunted little animal. The herd, infallible in its banded instinct, knew at once that a stranger had been thrust into it, and it was merciless at the hunt. As the lunch-time recess came, Eugene, clutching his big grease-stained bag, would rush for the playground pursued by the yelping pack. The leaders, two or three big louts of advanced age and deficient mentality, pressed closely about him, calling out suppliantly, ""You know me, 'Gene. You know me""; and still racing for the far end, he would open his bag and hurl to them one of his big sandwiches, which stayed them for a moment, as they fell upon its possessor and clawed it to fragments, but they were upon him in a moment more with the same yelping insistence, hunting him down into a corner of the fence, and pressing in with outstretched paws and wild entreaty. He would give them what he had, sometimes with a momentary gust of fury, tearing away from a greedy hand half of a sandwich and devouring it. When they saw he had no more to give, they went away.",1
325,"The great fantasy of Christmas still kept him devout. Gant was his unwearied comrade; night after night in the late autumn and early winter, he would scrawl petitions to Santa Claus, listing interminably the gifts he wanted most, and transmitting each, with perfect trust, to the roaring chimney. As the flame took the paper from his hand and blew its charred ghost away with a howl, Gant would rush with him to the window, point to the stormy northern sky, and say:  ""There it goes! Do you see it?""  He saw it.",1
329,"There was a boy named Otto Krause, a cheese-nosed, hair-faced, inch-browed German boy, lean and swift in the legs, hoarse-voiced and full of idiot laughter, who showed him the gardens of delight. There was a girl named Bessie Barnes, a black-haired, tall, bold- figured girl of thirteen years who acted as model. Otto Krause was fourteen, Eugene was eight: they were in the third grade. The German boy sat next to him, drew obscenities on his books, and passed his furtive scrawled indecencies across the aisle to Bessie.",1
331,"And Eugene, directing his fire against the principal, a plump, soft, foppish young man whose name was Armstrong, and who wore always a carnation in his coat, which, after whipping an offending boy, he was accustomed to hold delicately between his fingers, sniffing it with sensitive nostrils and lidded eyes, produced in the first rich joy of creation scores of rhymes, all to the discredit of Armstrong, his parentage, and his relations with Miss Groody. He was obsessed; he spent the entire day now in the composition of poetry--all bawdy variations of a theme. And he could not bring himself to destroy them. His desk was stuffed with tiny crumpled balls of writing: one day, during the geography lesson, the woman caught him. His bones turned to rubber as she bore down on him glaring, and took from the concealing pages of his book the paper on which he had been writing. At recess she cleared his desk, read the sequence, and, with boding quietness, bade him to see the principal after school.",1
338,"But oh, the brave autumn and the songs they sang; harvest, and the painting of a leaf; and ""half-holiday to-day""; and ""up in the air so high""; and the other one about the train--""the stations go whistling past""; the mellow days, the opening gates of desire, the smoky sun, the dropping patter of dead leaves. Every little snowflake is different in shape from every other. Good grashus!",1
341,"And he sang softly, in his thin humming ghost's voice:        ""The woodpecker pecked at the schoolhouse door,       He pecked and he pecked till his pecker got sore. The woodpecker pecked at the schoolhouse bell,       He pecked and he pecked till his pecker got well. They laughed--Eugene with rocking throatiness, Ben with a quiet snicker.",1
342,"He had aqueous gray eyes, and a sallow bumpy skin. His head was shapely, the forehead high and bony. His hair was crisp, maple-brown. Below his perpetual scowl, his face was small, converging to a point: his extraordinarily sensitive mouth smiled briefly, flickeringly, inwardly--like a flash of light along a blade. And he always gave a cuff instead of a caress: he was full of pride and tenderness.",1
346,"They spat joyously upon the Jews. Drown a Jew and hit a nigger. The boys would wait on the Jews, follow them home shouting ""Goose Grease! Goose Grease!"" which, they were convinced, was the chief staple of Semitic diet; or with the blind acceptance of little boys of some traditional, or mangled, or imaginary catchword of abuse, they would yell after their muttering and tormented victim: ""Veeshamadye Veeshamadye!"" confident that they had pronounced the most unspeakable, to Jewish ears, of affronts.",1
350,"Once, in the cherry time, when Gant's great White Wax was loaded with its clusters, and the pliant and enduring boughs were dotted thickly by the neighbor children, Jews and Gentiles alike, who had been herded under the captaincy of Luke, and picked one quart of every four for their own, one of these whitehaired children had come doubtfully, mournfully, up the yard. All right, son,"" Luke, who was fifteen, called out in his hearty voice. Get a basket and come on up. The child came up the gummed trunk like a cat: Eugene rocked from the slender spiral topmost bough, exulting in his lightness, the tree's resilient strength, and the great morning-clarion fragrant backyard world.",1
356,"He was three or four years older than Eugene, an awkward, heavy, muscular boy, smelling always of his father's paints and oils, coarse-featured, meaty sloping jaw and a thick catarrhal look about his nose and mouth. He was the breaker of visions; the proposer of iniquities. In the cool thick evening grass of Gant's yard one sunset, he smashed forever, as they lay there talking, the enchantment of Christmas; but he brought in its stead the smell of paint, the gaseous ripstink, the unadorned, sweating, and imageless passion of the vulgar. But Eugene couldn't follow his barn-yard passion: the strong hen- stench, the Tarkintonian paint-smell, and the rank-mired branch- smell which mined under the filthy shambles of the backyard, stopped him.",1
359,"Between the workroom and the ware-room, on the left as one entered, was Gant's office, a small room, deep in the dust of twenty years, with an old-fashioned desk, sheaves of banded dirty papers, a leather sofa, a smaller desk layered with round and square samples of marble and granite. The sloping market Square, pocketed obliquely off the public Square, and filled with the wagons of draymen and county peddlers, and on the lower side on a few Poor White houses and on the warehouse and office of Will Pentland. Eugene would find his father, leaning perilously on Jannadeau's dirty glass showcase, or on the creaking little fence that marked him off, talking politics, war, death, and famine, denouncing the Democrats, with references to the bad weather, taxation, and soup- kitchens that attended their administration, and eulogizing all the acts, utterances, and policies of Theodore Roosevelt. Jannadeau, guttural, judiciously reasonable, statistically argumentative, would consult, in all disputed areas, his library--a greasy edition of the World Almanac, three years old, saying, triumphantly, after a moment of dirty thumbing:  ""Ah--just as I thought: the muni-CIP-al taxation of Milwaukee under De-MO-cratic administration in 1905 was $2.25 the hundred, the lowest it had been in years. I cannot ima-GINE why the total revenue is not given. And he would argue with animation, picking his nose with his blunt black fingers, his broad yellow face breaking into flaccid creases, as he laughed gutturally at Gant's unreason.",1
361,"He is better at this than any one in all the world,"" Eugene thought, and his dark vision burned in him for a moment, as he thought that his father's work would never, as men reckon years, be extinguished, but that when that great skeleton lay powdered in earth, in many a tangled undergrowth, in the rank wilderness of forgotten churchyards, these letters would endure. And he thought with pity of all the grocers and brewers and clothiers who had come and gone, with their perishable work a forgotten excrement, or a rotted fabric; or of plumbers, like Max's father, whose work rusted under ground, or of painters, like Harry's, whose work scaled with the seasons, or was obliterated with newer brighter paint; and the high horror of death and oblivion, the decomposition of life, memory, desire, in the huge burial-ground of the earth stormed through his heart. He mourned for all the men who had gone because they had not scored their name upon a rock, blasted their mark upon a cliff, sought out the most imperishable objects of the world and graven there some token, some emblem that utterly they might not be forgotten.",1
372,"They stood silently a moment in the vast deserted nave of Saint Thomas'. Far in the depth of the vast church Old Michael's slender hands pressed softly on the organ-keys. The last rays of the setting sun poured in a golden shaft down through the western windows, falling for a moment, in a cloud of glory, as if in benediction, on Mainwaring's tired face.",1
376,"The sun had set. The gathering darkness hid the suspicious moisture in his gray eyes. Yes, alone,"" he said. Did not One greater than I go out alone some nineteen centuries ago? Alone?",1
377,"Alone? A sob rose in her throat and choked her. But before I go,"" he said, after a moment, in a voice which he strove in vain to render steady, ""I want to tell you-- He paused for a moment, struggling for mastery of his feelings.",1
389,"Why didn't you speak? I have loved you from the first. She leaned toward him, her lips half-parted and tremulous, her breathing short and uncertain, and as his bare arms circled her fiercely their lips met in one long moment of rapture, one final moment of life and ecstasy, in which all the pent longing of their lives found release and consummation now at this triumphant moment of their death.",1
400,"But, steeping himself in ancient myths, where the will and the deed were not thought darkly on, he spent himself, quilted in golden meadows, or in the green light of woods, in pagan love. Oh to be king, and see a fruity wide-hipped Jewess bathing on her roof, and to possess her; or a cragged and castled baron, to execute le droit de seigneur upon the choicest of the enfeoffed wives and wenches, in a vast chamber loud with the howling winds and lighted by the mad dancing flames of great logs! But even more often, the shell of his morality broken to fragments by his desire, he would enact the bawdy fable of school-boys, and picture himself in hot romance with a handsome teacher. In the fourth grade his teacher was a young, inexperienced, but well-built woman, with carrot-colored hair, and full of reckless laughter.",1
401,"He saw himself, grown to the age of potency, a strong, heroic, brilliant boy, the one spot of incandescence in a backwoods school attended by snag-toothed children and hair-faced louts. And, as the mellow autumn ripened, her interest in him would intensify, she would ""keep him in"" for imaginary offenses, setting him, in a somewhat confused way, to do some task, and gazing at him with steady yearning eyes when she thought he was not looking. He would pretend to be stumped by the exercise: she would come eagerly and sit beside him, leaning over so that a few fine strands of carrot-colored hair brushed his nostrils, and so that he might feel the firm warmth of her white-waisted arms, and the swell of her tight-skirted thighs. She would explain things to him at great length, guiding his fingers with her own warm, slightly moist hand, when he pretended not to find the place; then she would chide him gently, saying tenderly:  ""Why are you such a bad boy?"" or softly:  ""Do you think you're going to be better after this?",1
402,"And he, simulating boyish, inarticulate coyness, would say:  ""Gosh, Miss Edith, I didn't mean to do nothin'. Later, as the golden sun was waning redly, and there was nothing in the room but the smell of chalk and the heavy buzz of the old October flies, they would prepare to depart. As he twisted carelessly into his overcoat, she would chide him, call him to her, arrange the lapels and his necktie, and smooth out his tousled hair, saying:  ""You're a good-looking boy.",1
408,"That's what he's cut out for. Major Liddell spat accurately, out of his high cracked voice, across the pavement, and settled back in his chair below the library windows, smoothing his stained white pointed beard with a palsied hand. He was a veteran.",1
413,"It's nobody's business but my own. By God, I'm not asking any of you for anything,"" he said, sullenly and irritably, when Eliza pressed him curiously. He had a deep scowling affection for them all: he never forgot their birthdays, he always placed where they might find it, some gift, small, inexpensive, selected with the most discriminating taste. When, with their fervent over-emphasis, they went through long ecstasies of admiration, embroidering their thanks with florid decorations, he would jerk his head sideways to some imaginary listener, laughing softly and irritably, as he said:",1
416,"Ah Lord--it will be a bitter day for me when I have to depend on one of mine. Tarkinton told me the other day that Rafe has given him five dollars a week for his food ever since he was sixteen. Do you think I could look for such treatment from one of mine? Do you? Not until Hell freezes over--and not then! And he would refer to the hardships of his own youth, cast out, so he said, to earn his living, at an age which varied, according to his temper, at from six to eleven years, contrasting his poverty to the luxury in which his own children wallowed.",1
424,"Thus, before he was ten, Eugene's brooding spirit was nettled in the complexity of truth and seeming. He could find no words, no answers to the puzzles that baffled and maddened him: he found himself loathing that which bore the stamp of virtue, sick with weariness and horror at what was considered noble. He was hurled, at eight years, against the torturing paradox of the ungenerous- generous, the selfish-unselfish, the noble-base, and unable to fathom or define those deep springs of desire in the human spirit that seek public gratification by virtuous pretension, he was made wretched by the conviction of his own sinfulness.",1
430,"Thus, Eugene gathered vaguely but poignantly, that other boys of his age were not only self-supporting, but had for years kept their decrepit parents in luxury by their earnings as electrical engineers, presidents of banks, or members of Congress. There was, in fact, no excess of suggestion that Gant did not use upon his youngest son--he had felt, long since, the vibration to every tremor of feeling of the million-noted little instrument, and it pleased him to see the child wince, gulp, tortured with remorse. Thus, while he piled high with succulent meat the boy's platter, he would say sentimentally:  ""I tell you what: there are not many boys who have what you have.",1
432,"I'll vow, Mr. Gant,"" Eliza bridled, also pleased, ""you oughtn't to do that to the child.  Or, he would speak sadly of ""Little Jimmy,"" a legless little boy whom he had often pointed out to Eugene, who lived across the river from Riverside, the amusement park, and around whom he had woven a pathetic fable of poverty and orphanage which was desperately real now to his son. When Eugene was six, Gant had promised him carelessly a pony for Christmas, without any intention of fulfilling his promise. As Christmas neared he had begun to speak touchingly of ""Little Jimmy,"" of the countless advantages of Eugene's lot and, after a mighty struggle, the boy had renounced the pony, in a scrawled message to Elfland, in favor of the cripple. Eugene never forgot: even when he had reached manhood the deception of ""Little Jimmy"" returned to him, without rancor, without ugliness, only with pain for all the blind waste, the stupid perjury, the thoughtless dishonor, the crippling dull deceit.",1
436,"Yes, sir. Yes, sir,"" he would begin in a sonorous voice, dropping wide-leggedly into the ""prospect's"" stride.

438,"And they would roar with wheezing, red-faced, Southern laughter:  ""By God, he's a good 'un. Here, son, give me one of the damn things. I don't want it, but I'll buy it just to hear you talk. He was full of pungent and racy vulgarity: he had, more than any of the family, a Rabelaisian earthiness that surged in him with limitless energy, charging his tongue with unpremeditated comparisons, Gargantuan metaphors.",1
441,"All right, Christopher Columbus,"" continued Luke, good-humoredly. What do you tell 'em, son?""  The boy cleared his throat timidly:  ""Mister, do you want to buy a copy of The Saturday Evening Post?""  ""Oh, twah-twah,"" said Luke, with mincing delicacy, as the boys sniggered, ""sweet twah-twah! Do you expect them to buy with a spiel like that? My God, where are your brains? Sail into them. Tackle them, and don't take no for an answer. Don't ask them if they WANT to buy. Dive into them:  'Here you are, sir--hot off the press.' Jesus Christ,"" he yelled, looking at the distant court- house clock with sudden fidget, ""we should have been out an hour ago. Come on--don't stand there: here are your papers. How many do you want, you little Kike?""--for he had several Jews in his employ: they worshipped him and he was very fond of them--he liked their warmth, richness, humor.",1
450,"In God's name, mama,"" he burst out irritably to Eliza, ""haven't you got a clean shirt to give him? You know, he ought to have one every month or so. What do you mean?",1
454,"What are you trying to do with your kid, mama? he said in a hard quiet voice, after a silence. Do you want to make a tramp out of him? What do you mean?",1
455,"What do you mean?""  ""Do you think it's right to send him out on the streets with every little thug in town? Why, I don't know what you're talking about, boy,"" she said impatiently. It's no disgrace for a boy to do a little honest work, and no one thinks so. Oh, my God,"" he said to the dark angel.",1
456,"Listen to that! Eliza pursed her lips without speaking for a time. Pride goeth before a fall,"" she said after a moment. Pride goeth before a fall. I can't see that that makes much difference to us,"" said he.",1
458,"You don't meet any one. I don't notice any of your fine brothers or their wives coming to see you. This was true, and it hurt.",1
459,"She pursed her lips. No, mama,"" he continued after a moment's pause, ""you and the Old Man have never given a damn what we've done so long as you thought you might save a nickel by it. Why, I don't know what you're talking about, boy,"" she answered.",1
460,"You talk as if you thought we were Rich Folks. Beggars can't be choosers. Oh, my God,"" he laughed bitterly.",1
461,"You and the Old Man like to make out you're paupers, but you've a sock full of money. I don't know what you mean,"" she said angrily. No,"" he said, with his frequent negative beginning, after a moody silence, ""there are people in this town without a fifth what we've got who get twice as much out of it. The rest of us have never had anything, but I don't want to see the kid made into a little tramp. There was a long silence.",1
473,"And however vaguely, confusedly, and casually they approached this complete disruption of their life together, the rooting up of their clamorous home, when the hour of departures came, the elements resolved themselves immutably and without hesitation. Eliza took Eugene with her. He was the last tie that bound her to all the weary life of breast and cradle; he still slept with her of nights; she was like some swimmer who ventures out into a dark and desperate sea, not wholly trusting to her strength and destiny, but with a slender cord bound to her which stretches still to land.",1
480,"What do you mean by running off to your papa's like that? If I were you, I'd have too much pride for that. I'd be a-sha-a-med!"" Her face worked with a bitter hurt smile. Helen can't be bothered with you. She doesn't want you around.",1
481,"But the powerful charm of Gant's house, of its tacked and added whimsy, its male smell, its girdling rich vines, its great gummed trees, its roaring internal seclusiveness, the blistered varnish, the hot calfskin, the comfort and abundance, seduced him easily away from the great chill tomb of Dixieland, particularly in winter, since Eliza was most sparing of coal. Gant had already named it ""The Barn""; in the morning now, after his heavy breakfast at home, he would swing gauntly toward town by way of Spring Street, composing en route the invective that he had formerly reserved to his sitting-room. He would stride through the wide chill hall of Dixieland, bursting in upon Eliza, and two or three negresses, busy preparing the morning meal for the hungry boarders who rocked energetically upon the porch. All of the objections, all of the abuse that had not been uttered when she bought the place, were vented now.",1
482,"Woman, you have deserted my bed and board, you have made a laughing stock of me before the world, and left your children to perish. Fiend that you are, there is nothing that you would not do to torture, humiliate and degrade me. You have deserted me in my old age; you have left me to die alone. Ah, Lord! It was a bitter day for us all when your gloating eyes first fell upon this damnable, this awful, this murderous and bloody Barn. There is no ignominy to which you will not stoop if you think it will put a nickel in your pocket. You have fallen so low not even your own brothers will come near you. 'Nor beast, nor man hath fallen so far.' And in the pantries, above the stove, into the dining-room, the rich voices of the negresses chuckled with laughter.",1
489,"All the boarders were very fond of her: they said she was a fine girl. Every one did. There was a spacious and unsparing generosity about her, a dominant consuming vitality, which ate at her poor health, her slender supply of strength, so that her shattered nerves drew her frequently toward hysteria, and sometimes toward physical collapse. She was almost six feet tall: she had large hands and feet, thin straight legs, a big-boned generous face, with the long full chin slightly adroop, revealing her big gold-traced upper teeth. But, in spite of this gauntness, she did not look hard-featured or raw-boned. Her face was full of heartiness and devotion, sensitive, whole-souled, hurt, bitter, hysterical, but at times transparently radiant and handsome.",1
492,"Why, law me, child. H-m! Yes. It's GOOD soup,"" said she, touched with her great earthy burlesque.",1
496,"Later, in the cool dark, Gant, rocking violently, would hold forth on the porch, his great voice carrying across the quiet neighborhood, as he held the charmed boarders by his torrential eloquence, his solution of problems of state, his prejudiced but bold opinion upon current news. --And what did WE do, gentlemen? We sank their navy in an action that lasted only twenty minutes, stormed at by shot and shell, Teddy and his Rough Riders took the hill at Santiago--it was all over, as you well know, in a few months. We had declared war with no thought of ulterior gain; we came because the indignation of a GREAT people had been aroused at the oppression of a smaller one, and then, with a magnanimity well worthy the greatest people of the face of the earth, we paid our defeated enemy twenty millions of dollars. Ah, Lord! That was magnanimity indeed! You don't think any other nation would have done that, do you?""  ""No, sir,"" said the boarders emphatically.",1
505,"As the house filled, in the summer season, and it was necessary to wait until the boarders had eaten before a place could be found for him, he walked sullenly about beneath the propped back porch of Dixieland, savagely exploring the dark cellar, or the two dank windowless rooms which Eliza rented, when she could, to negresses. He felt now the petty cruelty of village caste. On Sunday for several years, he had bathed, brushed, arrayed his anointed body in clean underwear and shirting and departed, amid all the pleasurable bustle of Sunday morning, for the Presbyterian Sunday School. He had by this time been delivered from the instruction of the several spinsters who had taught his infant faith the catechism, the goodness of God, and the elements of celestial architecture. The five-cent piece which formerly he had yielded up reluctantly, thinking of cakes and ale, he now surrendered more gladly, since he usually had enough left over for cold gaseous draughts at the soda- fountain.",1
507,"He read the text, or the parable of the day's study, commented on it with Cæsarean dryness and concision, and surrendered the service to his assistant, a shaven, spectacled, Wilsonian-looking man, also Scotch, who smiled with cold affection at them over his high shiny collar, and led them through the verses of a hymn, heaving up his arms and leering at them encouragingly, as they approached the chorus. A sturdy spinstress thumped heavily upon a piano which shook like a leaf. Eugene liked the high crystal voices of the little children, backed by the substantial marrow of the older boys and girls, and based on the strong volume of the Junior and Senior Baraccas and Philatheas. They sang:        ""Throw out the lifeline, throw out the lifeline,       Someone is sinking to-day-ee""--   on the mornings when the collection went for missionary work.",1
515,"He said he only had a little bronchial trouble. I asked him about it, and he laughed just as big as you please:  'Why, Mrs. Gant,' he said--"" and there would follow an endless anecdote, embellished with many a winding rivulet. The girl raged: it was one of Eliza's basic traits to defend blindly whatever brought her money.",1
522,"This satisfied her desire; it was what deeply she had wanted--she had found purging release in her savage attack upon him, and now she could drain herself cleanly in a wild smother of affection. She would seize him, struggling and screaming, in her long arms, plaster kisses all over his red mad face, soothing him with hearty flattery addressed in the third person:  ""Why, he didn't think I meant it, did he? Didn't he know I was only joking? Why, he's strong as a little bull, isn't he? He's a regular little giant, that's what he is. Why, he's perfectly wild, isn't he? His eyes popping out of his head. I thought he was going to knock a hole in the wall.--Yes, ma'am. Why, law me, yes, child. It's GOOD soup,"" resorting to her broad mimicry in order to make him laugh. And he would laugh against his will between his sobs, in a greater torture because of this agony of affection and reconciliation than because of the abuse.",1
526,"She liked, almost invariably, young fast women. She liked the hectic pleasure of their lives, the sense of danger, their humor and liberality. She was drawn magnetically to all the wedded harlotry, which, escaping the Sunday discipline of a Southern village, and the Saturday lust of sodden husbands, came gaily to Altamont in summer. She liked people who, as she said, ""didn't mind taking a little drink now and then. She liked Mary Thomas, a tall jolly young prostitute who came from Kentucky: she was a manicurist in an Altamont Hotel.",1
529,"Well, she's no hypocrite. That's one thing sure. She doesn't care who knows it. Or,  ""She's no worse than a lot of your little goody-goodies, if the truth's known.",1
531,"Every one in town knows about her. Your place is getting the reputation of a regular chippyhouse all over town. Eliza pursed her lips angrily:  ""I don't pay any attention to them,"" she said.",1
534,"Her closest companion, however, was a girl whose name was Nan Gudger: she was a brisk, slender, vital girl, with a waist so tightly corsetted that a man's hands might go around it. She was the trusted, accurate, infallible bookkeeper of a grocery store. She contributed largely to the support of her family--a mother whom Eugene looked upon with sick flesh, because of the heavy goitre that sagged from her loose neck; a crippled sister who moved about the house by means of crutches and the propulsive strength of her powerful shoulders; and two brothers, hulking young thugs of twenty and eighteen years, who always bore upon their charmed bodies fresh knife-wounds, blue lumps and swellings, and other marks of their fights in poolroom and brothel. They lived in a two-story shack of rickety lumber on Clingman Street: the women worked uncomplainingly in the support of the young men. Eugene went here with Helen often: she liked the vulgarity, the humor, the excitement of their lives--and it amused her particularly to listen to Mary's obscene earthy conversation.",1
536,"You're joking,"" Helen said, laughing. Good God, child, don't you know THAT?"" said Mary, spitting inaccurately at the fire. Hit's good for their health. They'd git sick if we didn't. Eugene began to slide helplessly toward the floor.",1
538,"They were crude, kindly, ignorant, and murderous people. Nan was scrupulously respectable and well-mannered: she had thick negroid lips that turned outward, and hearty tropical laughter. She replaced the disreputable furniture of the house by new shiny Grand Rapids chairs and tables. There was a varnished bookcase, forever locked, stored with stiff sets of unread books--The Harvard Classics, and a cheap encyclopædia.",1
542,"And, at night, as Eugene listened to the low sweet voice of the woman, heard the rich sensual burst of her laughter, as she sat in the dark porch with a commercial traveller or some merchant in the town, his blood grew bitter with the morality of jealousy: he withered with his hurt, thought of her little sleeping children, and, with a passionate sense of fraternity, of her gulled husband. He dreamed of himself as the redemptive hero, saving her in an hour of great danger, making her penitent with grave reproof, accepting purely the love she offered. In the morning, he breathed the seminal odor of her fresh bathed body as she passed him, gazed desperately into the tender sensuality of her face and, with a sense of unreality, wondered what change darkness wrought in this untelling face.",1
544,"Steve was now a young man in the first twenties. He was somewhat above the middle height, bumpy of face and sallow of skin, with a light pleasing tenor voice. Eugene had a feeling of disgust and horror whenever his oldest brother returned: he knew that those who were physically least able to defend themselves, which included Eliza and himself, would bear the brunt of his whining, petty bullying, and drunken obscenity. He did not mind the physical abuse so much as he did its cowardly stealth, weakness, and slobbering reconciliations.",1
545,"Once, Gant, making one of his sporadic efforts to get his son fixed in employment, had sent him out to a country graveyard to put up a small monument. Eugene was sent along. Steve worked steadily in the hot sun for an hour, growing more and more irritable because of the heat, the rank weedy stench of the graveyard, and his own deep antipathy to work. Eugene waited intensely for the attack he knew was coming.",1
570,"But the union between Gant and his daughter was finally consummated. Before Gant lay, half-presaged, a road of pain and terror which led on to death, but as his great strength dwindled, palsied, broke along that road, she went with him inch by inch, welding beyond life, beyond death, beyond memory, the bond that linked them. I'd have died if it hadn't been for that girl,"" he said over and over. She saved my life. I couldn't get along without her. And he boasted again and again of her devotion and loyalty, of the expenses of his journey, of the hotels, the wealth, the life they both had seen.",1
581,"Thus did he see first, he the hill-bound, the sky-girt, of whom the mountains were his masters, the fabulous South. The picture of flashing field, of wood, and hill, stayed in his heart forever: lost in the dark land, he lay the night-long through within his berth, watching the shadowy and phantom South flash by, sleeping at length, and waking suddenly, to see cool lakes in Florida at dawn, standing quietly as if they had waited from eternity for this meeting; or hearing, as the train in the dark hours of morning slid into Savannah, the strange quiet voices of the men upon the platform, the boding faint echoes of the station, or seeing, in pale dawn, the phantom woods, a rutted lane, a cow, a boy, a drab, dull-eyed against a cottage door, glimpsed, at this moment of rushing time, for which all life had been aplot, to flash upon the window and be gone. The commonness of all things in the earth he remembered with a strange familiarity--he dreamed of the quiet roads, the moonlit woodlands, and he thought that some day he would come to them on foot, and find them there unchanged, in all the wonder of recognition. They had existed for him anciently and forever.",1
588,"Do you ever try to collect from them?"" he added, thumbing through the book. He takes it out in Poon-Tang,"" said Foxy, grinning, ""A week's subscription free for a dose. What you got to say about it?"" asked Number 3 belligerently.",1
592,"That's what you get for keeping every little crook that comes along. If you don't get a move on, 3, I'll give your route to another boy,"" said Randall. Hell, get another boy. I don't care,"" said Number 3, toughly.",1
600,"For God's sake, Mac,"" he called out irritably to the Make-up Man, as he scowled under the lifted lid, ""don't you ever keep anything except root-beer and sour milk?""  ""What do you want, for Christ's sake?""  ""I'd like to get a Coca-Cola once in a while. You know,"" he said bitingly, ""Old Man Candler down in Atlanta is still making it. Harry Tugman cast his cigarette away.",1
604,"Strangely, in sharp broken fragments, life awoke in the lilac darkness. Clop-clopping slowly on the ringing street, Number Six, Mrs. Goulderbilt's powerful brown mare, drew inevitably on the bottle-clinking cream-yellow wagon, racked to the top with creamy extra-heavy high-priced milk. The driver was a fresh-skinned young countryman, richly odorous with the smell of fresh sweat and milk. Eight miles, through the starlit dewy fields and forests of Biltburn, under the high brick English lodgegate, they had come into the town.",1
612,"Hello, son,"" he said in his barking kindly voice, ""what can I do for you?""  ""Oh, for God's sake,"" said Ben laughing contemptuously, and jerking his head toward Tugman. Listen to this, won't you?""  They sat down at the lower end. At this moment, Horse Hines, the undertaker, entered, producing, although he was not a thin man, the effect of a skeleton clad in a black frock coat. His long lantern mouth split horsily in a professional smile displaying big horse teeth in his white heavily starched face.",1
622,"By God, Tug,"" he said. They've got us cornered. Listen to him,"" said McGuire to Coker.",1
623,"A chip off the old block, isn't he? I brought that boy into the world, saw him through typhoid, got the old man over seven hundred drunks, and I've been called eighteen different kinds of son of a bitch for my pains ever since. But let one of 'em get a belly ache,"" he added proudly, ""and you'll see how quick they come running to me. Isn't that right, Ben?"" he said, turning to him.",1
624,"Oh, listen to this!"" said Ben, laughing irritably and burying his peaked face in his coffee mug. His bitter savor filled the place with life, with tenderness, with beauty. They looked on him with drunken, kindly eyes--at his gray scornful face and the lonely demon flicker of his smile.",1
625,"And I tell you something else,"" said McGuire, ponderously wheeling around on Coker, ""if one of them's got to be cut open, see who gets the job. What about it, Ben?"" he asked. By God, if you ever cut me open, McGuire,"" said Ben, ""I'm going to be damned sure you can walk straight before you do. Come on, Hugh,"" said Coker, prodding McGuire under his shoulder. ""Stop chasing those beans around the plate.",1
634,"O crush me! he said, ""I'm a grape! Dancing at the Hilliards, were you, you damned Mountain Grill. You've been on a Poon-Tang Picnic in Niggertown. You can't load that bunk on us. Bull-lunged, their laughter filled the nacreous dawn.",1
635,"Patent-leather pumps!"" said McGuire. Hurt his feet. By God, Coker, the first time he came to town ten years ago he'd never been curried above the knees. They had to throw him down to put shoes on him. Ben laughed thinly to the Angel.",1
636,"A couple of slices of buttered toast, if you please, not too brown,"" said Spaugh delicately to the counterman. A mess of hog chitlings and sorghum, you mean, you bastard. You were brought up on salt pork and cornbread. We're getting too low and coarse for him, Hugh,"" said Coker.",1
639,"We ought to keep it in the family, oughtn't we?""  Their laughter howled out into the tender dawn. This conversation is getting too rough for me,"" said Horse Hines banteringly as he got off his stool. Shake hands with Coker before you go, Horse,"" said McGuire. He's the best friend you've ever had. You ought to give him royalties. The light that filled the world now was soft and otherworldly like the light that fills the sea-floors of Catalina where the great fish swim.",1
651,"Did you read that one?""  Harry Tugman laughed heavily, not wholly knowing why. McGuire belched into the silence loudly and was witlessly adrift for a moment. Literature, literature, Dick,"" he returned portentously. It's been the ruin of many a good surgeon. You read too much, Dick. Yon Cassius hath a lean and hungry look. You know too much. The letter killeth the spirit, you know. Me--Dick, did you ever know me to take anything out that I didn't put back? Anyway, don't I always leave 'em something to go on with? I'm no scholar, Dick. I've never had your advantages. I'm a self-made butcher. I'm a carpenter, Dick. I'm an interior decorator. I'm a mechanic, a plumber, an electrician, a butcher, a tailor, a jeweller. I'm a jewel, a gem, a diamond in the rough, Dick. I'm a practical man. I take out their works, spit upon them, trim off the dirty edges, and send them on their way again. I economize, Dick; I throw away everything I can't use, and use everything I throw away. Who made the Pope a tailbone from his knuckle? Who made the dog howl? Aha-- that's why the governor looks so young. We are filled up with useless machinery, Dick.  Efficiency, economy, power! Have you a Little Fairy in your Home? You haven't! Then let the Gold Dust Twins do the work! Ask Ben--he knows! O my God!"" laughed Ben thinly, ""listen to that, won't you?""  Two doors below, directly before the Post Office, Pete Mascari rolled upward with corrugated thunder the shutters of his fruit shop.",1
652,"The pearl light fell coolly upon the fruity architecture, on the pyramided masonry of spit-bright wine-saps, the thin sharp yellow of the Florida oranges, the purple Tokays, sawdust-bedded. There was a stale fruity odor from the shop of ripening bananas, crated apples, and the acrid tang of powder; the windows are filled with Roman candles, crossed rockets, pinwheels, squat green Happy Hooligans, and multilating Jack Johnsons, red cannoncrackers, and tiny acrid packets of crackling spattering firecrackers. Light fell a moment on the ashen corpsiness of his face and on the liquid Sicilian poison of his eyes.",1
656,"I'd like a bath,"" he said to Dick Ravenel, ""and a shave. He rubbed his hand across his blotched hairy face. You can use my room, Hugh, at the hotel,"" said Jeff Spaugh, looking at Ravenel somewhat eagerly.",1
657,"I'll use the hospital,"" he said. You'll just have time,"" said Ravenel. In God's name, let's get a start on,"" he cried impatiently.",1
659,"They won't do much good to this one. She called me a low-down lickered-up whisky-drinking bastard last night: if she still feels like that she'll get well. These mountain women take a lot of killing,"" said Jeff Spaugh sagely.",1
660,"Do you want to come along? McGuire asked Coker. No, thanks. I'm getting some sleep,"" he answered. The old girl took a hell of a time. I thought she'd never get through dying. They started to go.",1
663,"Admiringly Harry Tugman's face turned to the slumped burly figure of Hugh McGuire. By God! he boasted, ""I bet he does the damnedest piece of operating you ever heard of. Why, hell,"" said the counterman loyally, ""he ain't worth a damn until he's got a quart of corn licker under his belt.",1
666,"Foaming with brilliant slapdash improvisation Harry Tugman declaimed:  ""Members of the Younger Set were charmingly entertained last night at a dinner dance given at Snotwood, the beautiful residence of Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Firkins, in honor of their youngest daughter, Gladys, who made her debut this season. Mr. and Mrs. Firkins, accompanied by their daughter, greeted each of the arriving guests at the threshhold in a manner reviving the finest old traditions of Southern aristocracy, while Mrs. Firkins' accomplished sister, Miss Catherine Hipkiss, affectionately known to members of the local younger set as Roaring Kate, supervised the checking of overcoats, evening wraps, jock-straps, and jewelry. Dinner was served promptly at eight o'clock, followed by coffee and Pluto Water at eight forty-five. A delicious nine-course collation had been prepared by Artaxerxes Papadopolos, the well- known confectioner and caterer, and proprietor of the Bijou Café for Ladies and Gents.",1
672,"With sharp whetted hunger he thought of breakfast. He threw the sheet back cleanly, swung in an orbit to a sitting position and put his white somewhat phthisic feet on the floor. Standing up tenderly, he walked over to his leather rocker and put on a pair of clean white-footed socks. Then he pulled his nightgown over his head, looking for a moment in the dresser mirror at his great boned structure, the long stringy muscles of his arms, and his flat- meated hairy chest. His stomach sagged paunchily. He thrust his white flaccid calves quickly through the shrunken legs of a union suit, stretched it out elasticly with a comfortable widening of his shoulders and buttoned it. Then he stepped into his roomy sculpturally heavy trousers and drew on his soft-leathered laceless shoes. Crossing his suspender braces over his shoulders, he strode into the kitchen and had a brisk fire of oil and pine snapping in the range within three minutes. He was stimulated and alive in all the fresh wakefulness of the Spring morning.",1
675,"He took off his glasses for a moment and looked at the ptotic malevolence of his left eye, and the large harlequinesque wart in the cheek below it. The black glasses gave the suggestion that he was half-masked; they added a touch of unsearchable mystery to the subtle, sensual and disquieting intelligence of his face. His negro man appeared at this moment and told him his bath was ready. He drew the long thin nightgown over his freckled Fitzsimmons body and stepped vigorously into tepid water. Then for ten minutes he was sponged, scraped, and kneaded, upon a long table by the powerful plastic hands of the negro. He dressed in fresh laundered underwear and newly pressed clothes of black. He tied a black string carelessly below the wide belt of starched collar and buttoned across his straight long figure a frock coat that reached his knees. He took a cigarette from a box on his table and lighted it.",1
676,"Bouncing tinnily down the coiling road that came through the Gap from the town, a flivver glinted momently through the trees. Two men were in it. His face hardened against it, he watched it go by his gates on the road with a scuffle of dust. Dimly he saw their lewd red mountain faces, and completed the image with sweat and corduroy. And in the town their city cousins. Brick, stucco, the white little eczema of Suburbia. Federated Half-Breeds of the World.",1
678,"At Dixieland, Eliza slept soundly in a small dark room with a window opening on the uncertain light of the back porch. Her chamber was festooned with a pendant wilderness of cord and string; stacks of old newspapers and magazines were piled in the corners; and every shelf was loaded with gummed, labelled, half-filled medicine bottles. There was a smell in the air of mentholatum, Vick's Pneumonia Cure, and sweet glycerine. The negress arrived, coming under the built-up house and climbing lazily the steep tunnel of back steps. She knocked at the door.",1
679,"Who's there! cried Eliza sharply, waking at once, and coming forward to the door. She wore a gray flannel nightgown over a heavy woollen undershirt that Ben had discarded: the pendant string floated gently to and fro as she opened the door, like some strange seamoss floating below the sea. Upstairs, in the small front room with the sleeping-porch, slept Miss Billie Edwards, twenty-four, of Missouri, the daring and masterful liontamer of Johnny L. Jones Combined Shows, then playing in the field on the hill behind the Plum Street School. Next to her, in the large airy room at the corner, Mrs. Marie Pert, forty-one, the wife of an itinerant and usually absent drug salesman, lay deep in the pit of alcoholic slumber. Upon each end of the mantel was a small snapshot in a silver frame--one of her absent daughter, Louise, eighteen, and one of Benjamin Gant, lying on the grass-bank in front of the house, propped on his elbow and wearing a wide straw hat that shaded all his face except his mouth. Also, in other chambers, front and back, Mr. Conway Richards, candy-wheel concessionaire with the Johnny L. Jones Combined Shows, Miss Lily Mangum, twenty-six, trained nurse, Mr. William H. Baskett, fifty-three, of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, cotton grower, banker, and sufferer from malaria, and his wife; in the large room at the head of the stairs Miss Annie Mitchell, nineteen, of Valdosta, Georgia, Miss Thelma Cheshire, twenty-one, of Florence, South Carolina, and Mrs. Rose Levin, twenty-eight, of Chicago, Illinois, all members of the chorus of ""Molasses"" Evans and His Broadway Beauties, booked out of Atlanta, Georgia, by the Piedmont Amusement Agency.",1
686,"You don't think there's anything she doesn't hear about, do you? So help me Jesus, you never heard a yap out of him for a week. He was afraid to show his face out of the office. At the Convent School of Saint Catherine's on Saint Clement's Road, Sister Theresa, the Mother Superior, walked softly through the dormitory lifting the window-shade beside each cot, letting the orchard cherry-apple bloom come gently into the long cool glade of roseleaf sleeping girls.",1
687,"Their breath expired gently upon their dewy half-opened mouths, light fell rosily upon the pillowed curve of their arms, their slender young sides, and the crisp pink buds of their breasts. At the other end of the room a fat girl lay squarely on her back, her arms and legs outspread, and snored solidly through blubbering lips. They had yet an hour of sleep.",1
690,"The self-respecting negro, J. H. Jackson, stood in his square vegetable-stall, attended by his two grave-faced sons, and his spectacled businesslike daughter. He was surrounded by wide slanting shelves of fruit and vegetables, smelling of the earth and morning--great crinkled lettuces, fat radishes still clotted damply with black loam, quill-stemmed young onions newly wrenched from gardens, late celery, spring potatoes, and the thin rinded citrous fruits of Florida. Above him, Sorrell, the fish and oyster man, drew up from the depths of an enamelled ice-packed can dripping ladlefuls of oysters, pouring them into thick cardboard cartons. Wide-bellied heavy seafish--carp, trout, bass, shad--lay gutted in beds of ice.",1
695,"Among the stalls of the market, the boarding-house keepers of Altamont walked with spying bargain-hunting eyes and inquisitive nose. They were of various sizes and ages, but they were all stamped with the print of haggling determination and a pugnacious closure of the mouth. They pried in among the fish and vegetables, pinching cabbages, weighing onions, exfoliating lettuce-heads. You've got to keep your eye on people or they'll skin you. And if you leave things to a lazy shiftless nigger she'll waste more than she cooks. They looked at one another hardfaced--Mrs. Barrett of the Grosvenor at Mrs. Neville of Glen View; Mrs. Ambler of the Colonial at Miss Mamie Featherstone of Ravencrest; Mrs. Ledbetter of the Belvedere--  ""I hear you're full up, Mrs. Coleman,"" said she inquiringly.",1
699,"And these bodiless phantoms of his life appeared with terrible precision, with all the mad nearness of a vision. That which was five years gone came within the touch of his hand, and he ceased at that moment to believe in his own existence. He expected some one to wake him; he would hear Gant's great voice below the laden vines, would gaze sleepily from the porch into the rich low moon, and go obediently to bed. But still there would be all that he remembered before that and what if--Cause flowed ceaselessly into cause.",1
702,"His sense of unreality came from time and movement, from imagining the woman, when the train had passed, as walking back into the house, lifting a kettle from the hearth embers. Thus life turned shadow, the living lights went ghost again. The boy among the calves. Where later? Where now?  I am, he thought, a part of all that I have touched and that has touched me, which, having for me no existence save that which I gave to it, became other than itself by being mixed with what I then was, and is now still otherwise, having fused with what I now am, which is itself a cumulation of what I have been becoming.",1
703,"Why here? Why there? Why now? Why then?  The fusion of the two strong egotisms, Eliza's inbrooding and Gant's expanding outward, made of him a fanatical zealot in the religion of Chance.",1
705,"He believed himself thus at the centre of life; he believed the mountains rimmed the heart of the world; he believed that from all the chaos of accident the inevitable event came at the inexorable moment to add to the sum of his life. Against the hidden other flanks of the immutable hills the world washed like a vast and shadowy sea, alive with the great fish of his imagining.  Variety, in this unvisited world, was unending, but order and purpose certain: there would be no wastage in adventure-- courage would be regarded with beauty, talent with success, all merit with its true deserving. There would be peril, there would be toil, there would be struggle. But there would not be confusion and waste. There would not be groping. For collected Fate would fall, on its chosen moment, like a plum. There was no disorder in enchantment.",1
708,"Meanwhile, business had been fairly good. Eliza's earning power the first few years at Dixieland had been injured by her illnesses. Now, however, she had recovered, and had paid off the last installment on the house. It was entirely hers. The property at this time was worth perhaps $12,000. In addition she had borrowed $3,500 on a twenty-year $5,000 life insurance policy that had only two years more to run, and had made extensive alterations: she had added a large sleeping-porch upstairs, tacked on two rooms, a bath, and a hallway on one side, and extended a hallway, adding three bedrooms, two baths, and a water-closet, on the other. Downstairs she had widened the veranda, put in a large sun-parlor under the sleeping-porch, knocked out the archway in the dining-room, which she prepared to use as a big bedroom in the slack season, scooped out a small pantry in which the family was to eat, and added a tiny room beside the kitchen for her own occupancy.",1
710,"In addition, Gant held 10 shares, which were already worth $200 each ($2,000), in the newly organized Fidelity Bank; his stock of stones, monuments, and fly-specked angels represented an investment of $2,700, although he could not have sold them outright for so much; and he had about $3,000 deposited in the Fidelity, the Merchants, and the Battery Hill banks. Thus, at the beginning of 1912, before the rapid and intensive development of Southern industry, and the consequent tripling of Altamont's population, and before the multiplication of her land values, the wealth of Gant and Eliza amounted to about $100,000, the great bulk of which was solidly founded in juicy well chosen pieces of property of Eliza's selection, yielding them a monthly rental of more than $200, which, added to their own earning capacities at the shop and Dixieland, gave them a combined yearly income of $8,000 or $10,000. Although Gant often cried out bitterly against his business and declared, when he was not attacking property, that he had never made even a bare living from his tombstones, he was rarely short of ready money: he usually had one or two small commissions from country people, and he always carried a well-filled purse, containing $150 or $200 in five- and ten-dollar bills, which he allowed Eugene to count out frequently, enjoying his son's delight, and the feel of abundance.",1
713,"Across the street from Dixieland was the Brunswick, a well-built red brick house of twenty rooms. The marble facings had been done by Gant himself twenty years before, the hardwood floors and oak timbering by Will Pentland. It was an ugly gabled Victorian house, the marriage gift of a rich Northerner to his daughter, who died of tuberculosis.",1
715,"We could have had our money back by now three times over,"" Eliza fretted. She did not have enough money at the time for any important investment. She saved and she waited.",1
725,"There was another long howl of mirth above. Gant paused, caught Helen's eye, and began to grin suddenly in an unwilling sheepish manner. God have mercy on us,"" he chuckled. She'll have the place filled with all of Barnum's freaks the next thing you know. At this moment, Simon, self-contained, distinguished and grave in his manner, descended the steps with Mr. Gilroy and Mr. Flannagan, his companions.",1
731,"We give him four or five dollars in small change every morning just to throw away. Simon caught sight of Gant for the first time. Look out for the Stingaree,"" he cried. Remember the Maine. I tell you what,"" said Eliza laughing.",1
739,"Thus, the entire landscape, the whole physical background of his life, was now dappled by powerful prejudices of liking and distaste formed, God knows how, or by what intangible affinities of thought, feeling and connotation. Thus, one street would seem to him to be a ""good street""--to exist in the rich light of cheerful, abundant, and high-hearted living; another, inexplicably, a ""bad street,"" touching him somehow with fear, hopelessness, depression. Perhaps the cold red light of some remembered winter's afternoon, waning pallidly over a playing-field, with all its mockery of Spring, while lights flared up smokily in houses, the rabble-rout of children dirtily went in to supper, and men came back to the dull but warm imprisonment of home, oil lamps (which he hated), and bedtime, clotted in him a hatred of the place which remained even when the sensations that caused it were forgotten.",1
740,"Or, returning from some country walk in late autumn, he would come back from Cove or Valley with dewy nose, clotted boots, the smell of a mashed persimmon on his knee, and the odor of wet earth and grass on the palms of his hands, and with a stubborn dislike and suspicion of the scene he had visited, and fear of the people who lived there. He had the most extraordinary love of incandescence. He hated dull lights, smoky lights, soft, or sombre lights. At night he wanted to be in rooms brilliantly illuminated with beautiful, blazing, sharp, poignant lights. After that, the dark.",1
747,"This was something new. They marched into the big room and sat down in blocks of seats assigned to each class: they sat with a seat between each of them. In a moment the door of the principal's office on the left--where little boys were beaten--was opened, and the principal came out. He walked around the corner of the big room and stepped softly up on the platform. He began to talk.",1
750,"The principal had a white face of waxen transparency, with deep flat cheeks like the Pentlands, a pallid nose, a trifle deeper in its color than his face, and a thin slightly-bowed mouth. His hair was coarse, black, and thick, but he never let it grow too long. He had short dry hands, strong, and always coated deeply with chalk. When he passed near by, Eugene got the odor of chalk and of the schoolhouse: his heart grew cold with excitement and fear. The sanctity of chalk and school hovered about the man's flesh. He was the one who could touch without being touched, beat without being beaten. Eugene had terrible fantasies of resistance, shuddering with horror as he thought of the awful consequences of fighting back: something like God's fist in lightning. Then he looked around cautiously to see if any one had noticed.",1
752,"He talked to the children aimlessly, pompously, dully for twenty minutes every morning: the teachers yawned carefully behind their hands, the students made furtive drawings, or passed notes. He spoke to them of ""the higher life"" and of ""the things of the mind. He assured them that they were the leaders of to-morrow and the hope of the world. Then he quoted Longfellow.",1
753,"He was a good man, a dull man, a man of honor. He had a broad streak of coarse earthy brutality in him. He loved a farm better than anything in the world except a school. He had rented a big dilapidated house in a grove of lordly oaks on the outskirts of town: he lived there with his wife and his two children. He had a cow--he was never without a cow: he would go out at night and morning to milk her, laughing his vacant silly laugh, and giving her a good smacking kick in the belly to make her come round into position.",1
754,"He was a heavy-handed master. He put down rebellion with good cornfield violence. If a boy was impudent to him he would rip him powerfully from his seat, drag his wriggling figure into his office, breathing stertorously as he walked along at his clumsy rapid gait, and saying roundly, in tones of scathing contempt: ""Why, you young upstart, we'll just see who's master here. I'll show you, my sonny, if I'm to be dictated to by every two-by-four whippersnapper who comes along. And once within the office, with the glazed door shut, he published the stern warning of his justice by the loud exertion of his breathing, the cutting swish of his rattan, and the yowls of pain and terror that he exacted from his captive.",1
757,"The warm wind spouted about the eaves; the grasses bent, whistling gently. Eugene wrote:  ""The girl is hearing the song of the first lark. She knows that it means Spring has come. She is about seventeen or eighteen years old. Her people are very poor, she has never been anywhere. In the winter she wears wooden shoes. She is making out as if she was going to whistle. But she doesn't let on to the bird that she has heard him. The rest of her people are behind her, coming down the field, but we do not see them. She has a father, a mother, and two brothers. They have worked hard all their life. The girl is the youngest child. She thinks she would like to go away somewhere and see the world. Sometimes she hears the whistle of a train that is going to Paris. She has never ridden on a train in her life. She would like to go to Paris. She would like to have some fine clothes, she would like to travel. Perhaps she would like to start life new in America, the Land of Opportunity. The girl has had a hard time. Her people do not understand her. If they saw her listening to the lark they would poke fun at her. She has never had the advantages of a good education, her people are so poor, but she would profit by her opportunity if she did, more than some people who have. You can tell by looking at her that she's intelligent. It was early in May; examinations came in another two weeks.",1
760,"Leonard took the paper, pretended to read half a page, looked off absently into eternity, and began to rub his chin reflectively, leaving a slight coating of chalk-dust on his face. Then, catching her eye, he laughed idiotically, and said:  ""Why, that little rascal! Huh? Do you suppose--? Feeling delightfully scattered, he bent over with a long suction of whining laughter, slapping his knee and leaving a chalk print, making a slobbering noise in his mouth.",1
762,"A few days later Leonard assembled the children a second time. He made a rambling speech, the purport of which was to inform them that one of them had won the prize, but to conceal the winner's name. Then, after several divagations, which he thoroughly enjoyed, he read Eugene's paper, announced his name, and called him forward.",1
763,"Chalkface took chalkhand. The boy's heart thundered against his ribs. The proud horns blared, he tasted glory.",1
764,"Patiently, all through the summer, Leonard laid siege to Gant and Eliza. Gant fidgeted, spoke shiftily, finally said:  ""You'll have to see his mother. Privately he was bitterly scornful, roared the merits of the public school as an incubator of citizenship. The family was contemptuous. Private school! Mr. Vanderbilt! Ruin him for good!",1
772,"Say,"" she said, rubbing her broad red nose, and smiling slyly, ""I used to be a school-teacher. You didn't know that, did you? But I didn't get any such prices as you're asking,"" she added. I thought myself mighty lucky if I got my board and twenty dollars a month. Is that so, Mrs. Gant?"" said Mr. Leonard with great interest.",1
778,"Margaret Leonard was of middling height, five feet six inches perhaps. As the giddiness of his embarrassment wore off he saw that she could not weigh more than eighty or ninety pounds. He had heard of the children. Now he remembered them, and Leonard's white muscular bulk, with a sense of horror. His swift vision leaped at once to the sexual relation, and something in him twisted aside, incredulous and afraid.",1
779,"She had on a dress of crisp gray gingham, not loose or lapping round her wasted figure, but hiding every line in her body, like a draped stick. As his mind groped out of the pain of impression he heard her voice and, still feeling within him the strange convulsive shame, he lifted his eyes to her face. It was the most tranquil and the most passionate face he had ever seen. The skin was sallow with a dead ashen tinge; beneath, the delicate bone-carving of face and skull traced itself clearly: the cadaverous tightness of those who are about to die had been checked. She had won her way back just far enough to balance carefully in the scales of disease and recovery. It was necessary for her to measure everything she did.",1
781,"Her hair was coarse and dull-brown, fairly abundant, tinged lightly with gray: it was combed evenly in the middle and bound tightly in a knot behind. Everything about her was very clean, like a scrubbed kitchen board: she took his hand, he felt the firm nervous vitality of her fingers, and he noticed how clean and scrubbed her thin somewhat labor-worn hands were. If he noticed her emaciation at all now, it was only with a sense of her purification: he felt himself in union not with disease, but with the greatest health he had ever known. She made a high music in him. His heart lifted.",1
796,"Huh?"" drawled Mr. Leonard, vacantly beginning to laugh. He was fingermarked with chalk from chin to crotch. Stephen (""Pap"") Rheinhart leaned forward gently and fleshed his penpoint in Eugene Gant's left rump. Eugene grunted painfully.",1
801,"He wrote Odes and Epodes,"" said Tom Davis. What is an Epode, Mr. Leonard?""  ""Why,"" said Mr. Leonard reflectively, ""it's a form of poetry. Hell!"" said ""Pap"" Rheinhart in a rude whisper to Eugene.",1
810,"Odi et amo: quore id faciam . . . Well, not altogether,"" said Mr. Leonard. Some of them,"" he conceded.  . .",1
817,"But he thought of Margaret and looked down, with a sudden sense of palsy, into the white ruination of boy-face. Too far beyond. He sat down again, shaken.",1
821,"What's the good of all this stuff?"" said Tom Davis argumentatively. Mr. Leonard was on sure ground here. He understood the value of the classics.",1
826,"It trains the mind to grapple with problems of all sorts,"" he said. According to what you say,"" said Tom Davis, ""a man who has studied Greek makes a better plumber than one who hasn't. Yes, sir,"" said Mr. Leonard, shaking his head smartly, ""you know, I believe he does.",1
837,"He looks old because he's been sick. He's only forty-nine. How do you know?"" said Tom Davis.",1
840,"Hell, you're their Pet. They know you'll believe whatever they tell you,"" said Julius Arthur. Pap"" Rheinhart looked at him searchingly, then shook his head as if a cure was impossible. They laughed at his faith.",1
844,"That she had been near death from tuberculosis, that the violent and garrulous Sheba had married an old man, who had begotten two children and was now about to die, that the whole little family, powerful in cohesive fidelity, were nursing their great sores in privacy, building up before the sharp eyes and rattling tongues of young boys a barrier of flimsy pretense and evasion, numbed him with a sense of unreality. Eugene believed in the glory and the gold. He lived more at Dixieland now. He had been more closely bound to Eliza since he began at Leonard's. Gant, Helen, and Luke were scornful of the private school. The children were resentful of it-- a little jealous. And their temper was barbed now with a new sting. They would say:  ""You've ruined him completely since you sent him to a private school.",1
848,"That boy's a hustler. At the end of Eugene's first year at Leonard's, Eliza told John Dorsey she could no longer afford to pay the tuition. He conferred with Margaret and, returning, agreed to take the boy for half price.",1
850,They were tan. He paid six dollars for them. He always bought good things. But they burnt the soles of his feet. In a scowling rage he loped to his room and took them off.,1
863,"Mark my words,"" said Gant. That girl's got Cherokee blood in her somewhere. She took a room, and for days rocked back and forth in a chair before the parlor fire.",1
868,Eliza was silent a moment longer. Where's your husband? she asked presently.,1
870,"A railroad man, you say? she inquired sharply. Yes'm.""  ""Well, it looks mighty funny to me he hasn't been in to see you,"" said Eliza, with enormous accusing tranquillity.",1
871,I'd call it a pretty poor sort of man who'd act like that. Mrs. Morgan said nothing. Her tar-black eyes glittered in fireflame.,1
881,"Deep womb, dark flower. The Hidden. The secret fruit, heart-red, fed by rich Indian blood. Womb-night brooding darkness flowering secretly into life.",1
886,"She was very fond of him; he was what she called ""a good family man. She liked domestic people; she liked men who were house- broken. The little man was very kind and very tame. Eugene liked him because he made good coffee. Eliza never bothered him about the money. Finally, he got work at the Inn, and quarters there. He paid Eliza all he owed her.",1
892,"There's nothing wrong with me. You're not strong, boy. You've got to get some meat on your bones. I tell you what, I'm worried by those circles under your eyes. Do you keep regular hours? He did not: he hated regular hours.",1
894,"But obediently he promised her that he would be regular--regular in eating, sleeping, studying, and exercising. But he had not yet learned to play with the crowd. He still feared, disliked and distrusted them.",1
899,"Moreover, Leonard surprised this youth one afternoon in Spring on the eastern flank of the hill, in the thick grass beneath a flowering dogwood, united in sexual congress with Miss Hazel Bradley, the daughter of a small grocer who lived below on Biltburn Avenue, and whose lewdness was already advertised in the town. Leonard, on second thought, did not go to the Bishop. He went to the Grocer.",1
906,"He was cold and sick about his heart. But when he opened his eyes again Edward, flushed and sobbing, was standing where he stood. Nothing had happened.",1
907,"Eugene waited for God's visitation upon the unhappy blasphemer. He gathered, from the slightly open paralysis that had frozen John Dorsey's and Sister Amy's face, that they were waiting too. Edward lived. There was nothing beyond this--nothing.",1
911,"He never forgot the Jew; he always thought of him with shame. But it was many years before he could understand that that sensitive and feminine person, bound to him by the secret and terrible bonds of his own dishonor, had in him nothing perverse, nothing unnatural, nothing degenerate. He was as much like a woman as a man. That was all. There is no place among the Boy Scouts for the androgyne--it must go to Parnassus.",1
922,"Early in Spring the woman, whose name was Margaret Lutz, returned to Dixieland. One drowsy afternoon Eugene found them at Gant's. The house was deserted save for them. They were sprawled out face downward, with their hands across each other's hips, on Gant's bed. They lay there silently, while he looked, in an ugly stupor. Steve's yellow odor filled the room. Eugene began to tremble with insane fury. The Spring was warm and lovely, the air brooded slightly in a flowering breeze, there was a smell of soft tar. He had come down to the empty house exultantly, tasting its delicious silence, the cool mustiness of indoors, and a solitary afternoon with great calf volumes. In a moment the world turned hag.",1
924,"What are you doing there on papa's bed?"" he screamed. Steve rose stupidly and seized him by the arm. The woman sat up, dopily staring, her short legs widened.",1
930,"The first-born. Little Stevie doesn't have to worry any longer,"" said he. He's on Easy Street. Where are all the Wise Guys now who said 'I told you so'? They're all mighty glad to give Little Stevie a Big Smile and the Glad Hand when he breezes down the street. Every Knocker is a Booster now all right, all right. I tell you what,"" said Eliza with proud smiles, ""he's no fool.",1
932,"That's all right, honey,"" she said, ""you let us know if he doesn't treat you right. We'll fix him. Steve's a good boy,"" said Margaret, ""when he isn't drinking.",1
933,"I've nothing to say against him when he's sober. She burst into tears. That awful, that awful curse,"" said Eliza, shaking her head sadly, ""the curse of licker. It's been responsible for the ruination of more homes than anything else. Well, she'll never win any beauty prizes, that's one thing sure,"" said Helen privately to Eliza.",1
936,"He's promised that he'd try. Well, I should hope so,"" said Helen scathingly. I should hope so. It's about time. Her dislike for him was innate.",1
940,"Nobody's asked your advice, have they? All of you are against me. None of you had a good word for me when I was down and out, and now it gets your goat to see me make good. He had believed for years that he was persecuted--his failure at home he attributed to the malice, envy, and disloyalty of his family, his failure abroad to the malice and envy of an opposing force that he called ""the world. No,"" he said, taking another long puff at the moist cigarette, ""don't worry about Stevie.",1
942,"Ben, who had been sitting on the piano stool all this time, scowling savagely at the keys, and humming a little recurrent tune to himself while he picked it out with one finger, turned now to Helen, with a sharp flicker of his mouth, and jerked his head sideways. I hear Mr. Vanderbilt's getting jealous,"" he said. Helen laughed ironically, huskily.",1
947,"Oh for God's sake! Ben cried irritably, wheeling around. What do you want to listen to him for? Can't you see he's crazy?""  As the summer lengthened, Steve began to drink heavily again.",1
950,"One night, at the supper hour, he returned to Dixieland, holding his tortured jaws between his hands. He found Eliza bending over the spitting grease of the red-hot stove. He cursed her for bearing him, he cursed her for allowing him to have teeth, he cursed her for lack of sympathy, motherly love, human kindliness.",1
951,"Her white face worked silently above the heat. Get out of here,"" she said. You don't know what you're talking about. It's that accursed licker that makes you so mean. She began to weep, brushing at her broad red nose with her hand.",1
953,"The antagonism between the boy and his older brother was deep and deadly. It had lasted for years. Now, trembling with anger, Luke came to his mother's defense.",1
955,"Steve drove at him viciously, smashing drunkenly at his face with both hands. He was driven gasping and blinded across the kitchen. Wrong forever on the throne.",1
962,"Well, forget about it,"" said Helen quietly. Her voice was casual, weary, sad. How do you feel, Steve?"" she asked.",1
975,"Steve went away with the German woman to Indiana, where, at first, came news of opulence, fatness, ease, and furs (with photographs), later of brawls with her honest brothers, and talk of divorce, reunion and renascence. He gravitated between the two poles of his support, Margaret and Eliza, returning to Altamont every summer for a period of drugs and drunkenness that ended in a family fight, jail, and a hospital cure. Hell commences,"" howled Gant, ""as soon as he comes home. He's a curse and a care, the lowest of the low, the vilest of the vile. Woman, you have given birth to a monster who will not rest until he has done me to death, fearful, cruel, and accursed reprobate that he is!",1
979,"B-b-b-but the one who's stuck by you through thick and thin gets no c-c-credit at all. He glanced meaningly at Helen. It's a d-d-damn shame. Forget about it,"" she said wearily.",1
982,"she said to Luke, mounting to hysteria. Do I get any credit? Do I? I can work my fingers to the bone for them, but do I get so much as Go to Hell for my trouble? Do I?""    In these years Helen went off into the South with Pearl Hines, the saddlemaker's daughter.",1
986,"For them, these ventures into new lands were eager with promise. The vacant idiot laughter, the ribald enthusiasm with which South Carolina or Georgia countrymen, filling a theatre with the strong smell of clay and sweat, greeted Pearl's songs, left them unwounded, pleased, eager. They were excited to know that they were members of the profession; they bought Variety regularly, they saw themselves finally a celebrated high-salaried team on ""big time"" in great cities. Pearl was to ""put over"" the popular songs, to introduce the rag melodies with the vital rhythm of her dynamic meatiness, Helen was to give operatic dignity to the programme. In a respectful hush, bathed in a pink spot, she sang ditties of higher quality--Tosti's ""Goodbye,"" ""The End of a Perfect Day,"" and ""The Rosary. She had a big, full, somewhat metallic voice: she had received training from her Aunt Louise, the splendid blonde who had lived in Altamont for several years after her separation from Elmer Pentland. Louise gave music lessons and enjoyed her waning youth with handsome young men. She was one of the ripe, rich, dangerous women that Helen liked. She had a little girl and went away to New York with the child when tongues grew fanged.",1
991,"Unpleasant men with wet cigars would ask them to have a convivial drink of corn whisky, call them ""girley,"" and suggest a hotel room or a motorcar as a meeting-place. When this happened, Pearl was stricken into silence; helpless and abashed, she appealed to Helen. And she, her large loose mouth tense and wounded at the corners, her eyes a little brighter, would answer:  ""I don't know what you mean by that remark.",1
998,"Enormous humor flowed from him like crude light. Men who had never known him seethed with strange internal laughter when they saw him, and roared helplessly when he began to speak. Yet, his physical beauty was astonishing. His head was like that of a wild angel-- coils and whorls of living golden hair flashed from his head, his features were regular, generous, and masculine, illuminated by the strange inner smile of idiot ecstasy.",1
1005,"Caruso, waiting his entrance, regarded him from time to time with a wide Wop smile. Wotta you call yourself, eh?"" asked Caruso, approaching and looking him over. W-w-w-why,"" he said, ""d-don't you know one of your s-s-s-soldiers when you see him?""  ""You're one hell of a soldier,"" said Caruso.",1
1015,"I've never had a moment's peace since I bought it,"" he howled. Accursed and bloody monster that it is, it will not be content until it has sucked out my life-blood, sold the roof over my head, and sent me out to the pauper's grave to perish. Merciful God,"" he wept, ""it's fearful, it's awful, it's cruel that I should be afflicted thus in my old age. Turning to his constrained and apologetic son abruptly, he said:  ""How much is the bill? Hey?"" His eyes roved wildly in his head.",1
1020,"--His laughter soared to a crazy falsetto. Daisy, arrived for a few weeks of summer coolness, quite blue with terror, would clutch the most recent of her annual arrivals to her breast, melodramatically, and moan: I beg of you, for the sake of my family, for the sake of my innocent motherless babes--""  ""Whah-whah-whah!""  ""He's a fiend out of hell,"" cried Gant, beginning to weep.",1
1023,"Fluescent with smooth ripe curves, the drawling virgins of the South filled summer porches. Luke was a darling. He was a dear, a fine boy, a big-hearted generous fellow, and just the cutest thing. Women liked him, laughed at him, pulled fondly the thick golden curls of his hair. He was sentimentally tender to children--girls of fourteen years. He had a grand romantic feeling for Delia Selborne, the oldest daughter of Mrs. Selborne. He bought her presents, was tender and irritable by turns. Once, at Gant's, on the porch under an August moon and the smell of ripening grapes, he caressed her while Helen sang in the parlor. He caressed her gently, leaned his head over her, and said he would like to lay it on her b-b-b-b-breast. Eugene watched them bitterly, with an inch of poison round his heart. He wanted the girl for himself: she was stupid, but she had the wise body and faint hovering smile of her mother. He wanted Mrs. Selborne more, he fantasied passionately about her yet, but her image lived again in Delia. As a result, he was proud, cold, scornful and foolish before them. They disliked him.",1
1026,"Pumping his fists wildly, he fought his phantom into defeat and himself into exhaustion. Luke had several hundred dollars saved from The Saturday Evening Post days, when he went off to school. He accepted very little money from Gant. He waited on tables, he solicited for college boarding-houses, he was the agent for a tailor who made Kippy Kampus Klothes. Gant boasted of these efforts. The town shifted its quid, nodded pertly, and spat, saying:  ""That boy'll make his mark.",1
1029,"But, in spite of all his effort, toward the end of his third year he was still a sophomore, with every prospect of remaining one. One day in Spring he wrote the following letter to Gant:  ""The b-b-b-bastards who r-r-run this place have it in for me. I've been c-c-c-crooked good and proper. They take your hard-earned m- m-money here and skin you. I'm g-g-g-going to a real school. He went to Pittsburgh and found work with the Westinghouse Electric Company.",1
1031,"From time to time, in summer for a few weeks, at Christmas for a few days, he returned to celebrate his holidays with his family. Always he brought Gant a suitcase stocked with beer and whisky. That boy was ""good to his father. 19   One afternoon in the young summer, Gant leaned upon the rail, talking to Jannadeau.",1
1042,"The King of England,"" he observed, ""is only a figurehead. He doesn't begin to have the power of the President of the United States. His power is severely li-MIT-ed,"" said Jannadeau gutturally, ""by custom but not by statute.",1
1047,"You've always got a word for every one. She gave a bright pleasant nod to Jannadeau, who swung his huge scowling head ponderously around and muttered at her. Why, Elizabeth,"" said Gant, ""you haven't changed an inch in fifteen years. I don't believe you're a day older. She was thirty-eight and pleasantly aware of it.",1
1048,"Oh, yes,"" she said laughing. You're only saying that to make me feel good. I'm no chicken any more. She had a pale clear skin, pleasantly freckled, carrot-colored hair, and a thin mouth live with humor.",1
1052,"Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh,"" said Gant, shaking his head. Too bad, too bad, too bad. Come back to my office,"" he said. They went back and sat down. Elizabeth dried her eyes.",1
1053,"What was her name?"" he asked. We called her Lily--her full name was Lillian Reed. Why, I knew that girl,"" he exclaimed.",1
1056,"How old was she? he asked. Twenty-two,"" said Elizabeth, beginning to weep again.",1
1060,"He will. Ah, Lord. He was silent a moment while he shook his head with slow regret.",1
1070,"But sometimes when he was drunk he fell weeping on his knees before it, called it Cynthia, and entreated its love, forgiveness, and blessing for its sinful but repentant boy. There was laughter from the Square. What's the matter?"" said Elizabeth. Don't you want to sell it?""  ""It will cost you a good deal, Elizabeth,"" he said evasively.",1
1072,"He knew he had nothing to cover or obliterate that place-- it left a barren crater in his heart. All right,"" he said. You can have it for what I paid for it-- $420. She took a thick sheaf of banknotes from her purse and counted the money out for him.",1
1075,"To each she shook her head. Finally, he said:  ""How's this one, Elizabeth? He read:         She went away in beauty's flower,       Before her youth was spent;       Ere life and love had lived their hour       God called her, and she went.",1
1080,"Where now? Where after? Where then?    20   Gant, during these years in which Helen and Luke, the two for whom he felt the deepest affection, were absent a large part of the time, lived a splintered existence at home and at Eliza's.",1
1081,"He feared and hated a lonely life, but habit was deeply rooted in him, and he was unwilling to exchange the well-used comfort of his own home for the bald wintriness of Eliza's. She did not want him. She fed him willingly enough, but his tirades and his nightly sojourns, both longer and more frequent now that his daughter was absent, annoyed her more than they ever had before.",1
1092,"He clapped his hand against his buttock with a sharp smack and shot the murderous forefinger at an ashcan, a lamp-post, and a barber- pole, with a snapping wrist. Gant, startled in composition, gave him a quick uneasy look. They walked on.",1
1095,"By God, stranger! he ejaculated, ""I never knew the man lived who could beat Faro to the draw. What's yore name? In the fam'ly Bible back home, pardner,"" the Stranger drawled, ""it's Eugene Gant, but folks out here generally calls me The Dixie Ghost.",1
1096,There was a slow gasp of wonder from the crowd. Gawd! some one whispered. It's the Ghost!,1
1098,"But the Ghost, who had faced death many times without a flicker of a lash, was unable to face something he saw now in a pair of big brown eyes. He took off his sombrero and twisted it shyly in his big hands. Why, that's all right, ma'am,"" he gulped awkwardly. Glad to be of service to a lady any time. By this time the two bartenders had thrown a table-cloth over Faro Bill, carried the limp body into the back room, and returned to their positions behind the bar.",1
1099,"The crowd clustered about in little groups, laughing and talking excitedly, and in a moment, as the pianist began to hammer out a tune on the battered piano, broke into the measures of a waltz. In the wild West of those days, passions were primitive, vengeance sudden, and retribution immediate. Two dimples sentinelled a platoon of milk-white teeth.",1
1100,"Won't you dance with me, Mr. Ghost?"" she coaxed. Thoughtfully he pondered on love's mystery. Pure but passionate. Appearances against her, 'tis true. The foul breath of slander. She worked in a bawdy-house but her heart was clean. Outside of that, what can one say against her? He thought pleasantly of murder. With child's eyes he regarded his extinct enemies. Men died violently but cleanly, in the movies. Bang-bang. Good-by, boys, I'm through. Through the head or heart--a clean hole, no blood. He had kept innocency. Do their guts or their brains come spilling out? Currant jelly where a face was, the chin shot off. Or down there that other--His arm beat the air like a wing: he writhed. If you lose that? Done, die. He clutched his throat in his anguish.",1
1101,"They bent down eastward along Academy Street, having turned right from the little caudal appendage that gave on the northeastern corner of the Square. The boy's mind flamed with bright streaming images, sharp as gems, mutable as chameleons. His life was the shadow of a shadow, a play within a play. He became the hero- actor-star, the lord of the cinema, and the lover of a beautiful movie-queen, as heroic as his postures, with a superior actuality for every make-believe. He was the Ghost and he who played the Ghost, the cause that minted legend into fact.",1
1104,"The theatre was dark, the second show was over. They stared curiously across the street at the posters. In this cold silence where were the Peaches? At the Athens now, upon the Square. They always went there after. Gant looked at his watch. 11:12. Big Bill Messier outside swinging his club and watching them. On the counter stools a dozen bucks and ogling rakehells. I've got a car outside. Dalliance under difficulties. Later, the Genevieve on Liberty Street. They all stay there. Whisperings. Footfalls. Raided.",1
1111,"More practically, he saw for himself great mansions in the ground, grottoes buried in the deep heart of a hill, vast chambers of brown earth, sumptuously appointed with his bee-like plunder. Cool hidden cisterns would bring him air; from a peephole in the hillside he could look down on a winding road and see armed men seeking for him, or hear their thwarted gropings overhead. He would pull fat fish from subterranean pools, his great earth cellars would be stocked with old wine, he could loot the world of its treasures, including the handsomest women, and never be caught.",1
1118,"He had no gift for philosophy. He could not view with amusement and detachment the death of the senses, the waning of desire, the waxing of physical impotence. He fed hungrily, lewdly, on all news of seduction: his amusement had in it the eyes of eagerness, the hot breath of desire. He was incapable of the pleasant irony by which the philosophic spirit mocks that folly it is no longer able to enjoy.",1
1128,"It made him mad to see her stand so strong. Murderous impotent, baffled--a maniacal anger against her groped for an outlet in him, sometimes exploding in a wild inchoate scream. He yielded weakly to invalidism, he became tyrannous of attention, jealous of service. Her indifference to his health maddened him, created a morbid hunger for pity and tears. At times he got insanely drunk and tried to frighten her by feigning death, one time so successfully that Ben, bending over his rigid form in the hallway, was whitened with conviction.",1
1132,"He went three times a week to Cardiac's office for treatment. The dry doctor had grown old; behind his dusty restraint, the prim authority of his manner, there was a deepening well of senile bawdry. He had a comfortable fortune, he cared little for his dwindling practice. He was still a brilliant bacteriologist: he spent hours over slides etched in flowering patterns of bacilli, and he was sought after by diseased prostitutes, to whom he rendered competent service.",1
1136,"The late Oscar Wilde, for instance. 21   During the first years of this illness Gant showed a diminished, but not a seriously impaired, energy. At first he had, under the doctor's treatment, periods of tranquillity when he almost believed himself well. There were also times when he became a whining dotard over night, lay indolently abed for days, and was flabbily acquiescent to his disorder. These climaxes usually came on the heels of a roaring spree. The saloons had been closed for years: the town had been one of the first to vote on ""local option. Gant had piously contributed his vote for purity.",1
1141,"Outside the corrugated walls of the warehouse, Gant paused for a moment to acknowledge the fervent congratulation of a group of ladies from the First Baptist Church: Mrs. Tarkinton, Mrs. Fagg Sluder, Mrs. C. M. McDonnel, and Mrs. W. H. (Pert) Pentland, who, heavily powdered, trailed her long skirt of gray silk with a musty rustle, and sneered elegantly down over her whaleboned collar. She was very fond of Gant.",1
1142,"Where's Will?"" he asked. Feathering the pockets of the licker interests, when he ought to be down here doing the Lord's Work,"" she replied with Christian bitterness. Nobody but you knows what I've had to put up with, Mr. Gant. You've had to put up with the queer Pentland streak, in your own home,"" she added with lucid significance.",1
1143,"He shook his head regretfully, and stared sorrowfully at the gutter. Ah, Lord, Pett! We've been through the mill--both of us. A smell of drying roots and sassafras twisted a sharp spiral from the warehouse into the thin slits of his nostrils.",1
1145,"--it has brought poverty, disease, and suffering to hundreds of thousands of homes, broken the hearts of wives and mothers, and taken bread from the mouths of little orphaned children. Amen, brother. It has been,"" Gant began, but at this moment his uneasy eye lighted upon the broad red face of Tim O'Doyle and the fierce whiskered whiskiness of Major Ambrose Nethersole, two prominent publicans, who were standing near the entrance not six feet away and listening attentively.",1
1153,"A handsome woman yet, he thought. Good evening, madam. He got up from his rocker, put aside the crackling sheets of the evening paper (Republican), and undipped his steel-rimmed glasses from the great blade of his nose.",1
1157,"Her mouth worked silently at attempted speech for a moment. She speared a frying steak and flipped it over on its raw back, smiling vengefully in a mounting column of greasy blue vapor. He poked her clumsily with his stiff fingers; she shrieked a protest mixed of anger and amusement, and moved awkwardly out of his reach with bridling gait.",1
1158,Get away! I don't want you round me! It's too late for that. She laughed with nagging mockery.,1
1159,"Don't you wish you could, though? I'll vow! she continued, kneading her lips for several seconds in an effort to speak. I'd be ashamed. Every one's laughing at you behind your back. You lie!",1
1163,"As she rested there, in Mrs. Tarkinton's consolatory arms, weeping hysterically and dredging gullies in her poor painted face, they heard his chaotic footsteps blundering within his house, the heavy crash of furniture, and his fierce curses when he fell. He'll kill himself! He'll kill himself! she cried. He doesn't know what he's doing. Oh, my God! she wept. I've never been talked to that way by any man in my life! Gant fell heavily within his house.",1
1175,"And of course she'll tell Mrs. Selborne all about it, as soon as she goes back to Henderson,"" Helen continued. O my God! Gant whined, ""why was this put on me--""  ""O gotohell!",1
1176,"Gotohell! she said comically, her wrath loosened suddenly by a ribald and exasperated smile. They howled.",1
1180,"Eugene lolled about feebly on the floor, kicking one leg out gently as if he had just been decapitated, and fumbling blindly at the neckband of his nightshirt. A faint clucking sound came at intervals from his wide-open mouth. They laughed wildly, helplessly, draining into mad laughter all the welled and agglutinated hysteria that had gathered in them, washing out in a moment of fierce surrender all the fear and fatality of their lives, the pain of age and death.",1
1190,"What do you think! she whispered, and shook her pursed lips again. Always ten years older at least.""  ""Poor old Ben!",1
1191,"Helen said again. The quiet one, the sad one. I tell you what! Eliza shook her head, unable to speak. Her eyes too were wet.",1
1192,"They thought of sons and lovers: they drew closer in their communion, they drank the cup of their twin slavery as they thought of the Gant men who would always know hunger, the strangers on the land, the unknown farers who had lost their way. O lost! The hands of women were hungry for his crisp hair. When they came to the paper office to insert advertisements they asked for him. Frowning gravely, he leaned upon the counter with feet crossed, reading, in a somewhat illiterate monotone, what they had written. His thin hairy wrists slatted leanly against his starched white cuffs, his strong nervous fingers, ivoried by nicotine, smoothed out the crumples. Scowling intently, he bent his fine head, erasing, arranging. Emphatic lady-fingers twitched. How's that?"" Answers vague-voiced, eyes tangled in crisp hair. Oh, much better, thank you. Wanted: frowning boy-man head for understanding fingers of mature and sympathetic woman.",1
1197,"Thus, like a child, he groped intently at all meanings, with scowling studiousness. Women liked to see him scowl and study so. He was sudden only in anger, and in his quick communications with his angel.",1
1205,"A voice, sleep-strange and loud, forever far-near, spoke. Eugene!  Spoke, ceased, continued without speaking, to speak. In him spoke. Where darkness, son, is light. Try, boy, the word you know remember. In the beginning was the logos. Over the border the borderless green-forested land. Yesterday, remember?  Far-forested, a horn-note wound.",1
1209,"From the press-room downstairs there was an ascending roar as the big press mounted to its capacity. As he entered the office and drank in the warm tides of steel and ink that soaked the air, he awoke suddenly, his light-drugged limbs solidifying with a quick shock, as would some aerial spirit, whose floating body corporealizes the instant it touches earth. The carriers, waiting in a boisterous line, filed up to the circulation manager's desk, depositing their collections, cold handfuls of greasy coin. Seated beneath a green-shaded light, he ran swiftly down their books, totalling up their figures and counting nickels, dimes, and pennies into little spooned trays of a drawer. Then he gave to each a scrawled order for his morning quota.",1
1210,"They ran downstairs, eager as whippets to be off, brandishing their slips at a sullen counter whose black fingers galloped accurately across the stiff ridges of a great sheaf. He allowed them two ""extras. If the carrier was not scrupulous, he increased his number of spare copies by keeping on his book the names of a half- dozen discontinued subscribers. These surplus copies were always good for coffee and pie with the lunchman, or as tribute to a favorite policeman, fireman, or motorman.",1
1217,"In the fresh pre-natal morning they began their route, walking down the steep hill of Valley Street into tropical sleep, past the stabled torpor of black sleepers, past all the illicit loves, the casual and innumerable adulteries of Niggertown. As the stiff block of paper thudded sharply on the flimsy porch of a shack, or smacked the loose boarding of a door, they were answered by a long sullen moan of discontent. They sniggered.",1
1218,"Check this one off,"" said Jennings Ware, ""if you can't collect next time. She owes for six weeks now. This one,"" he said, flipping a paper quietly on a door mat, ""is good pay.",1
1220,"You can have that if you want it. A wan smile of fear struggled across Eugene's mouth. Jennings Ware looked at him shrewdly, but did not press him. Jennings Ware was a good-hearted boy.",1
1222,"It's a hell of a route,"" said Jennings Ware. When it rains it's terrible. You'll go into mud up to your knees. And you can't collect from half the bastards. He hurled a paper viciously.",1
1223,"But, oh man,"" he said, after a moment. If you want Jelly Roll you've come to the right place. I ain't kidding you!""  ""With--with niggers?",1
1228,"And Eugene watched the slow fusion of the seasons; he saw the royal processional of the months; he saw the summer light eat like a river into dark; he saw dark triumph once again; and he saw the minute-winning days, like flies, buzz home to death. In summer, full day had come before he finished: he walked home in a world of wakenings. The first cars were grouped on the Square as he passed, their new green paint giving them the pleasant appearance of fresh toys. The huge battered cans of the milkmen glinted cleanly in the sun. Light fell hopefuly upon the swarthy greasiness of George Chakales, nightman of the Athens Cafe. The Hellenic Dawn. And in Uneeda No. 1, upon the Square, Eugene sat, washing an egg-sandwich down with long swallows of pungent coffee, stooled in a friendly company of motormen, policemen, chauffeurs, plasterers, and masons. It was very pleasant, he felt, to complete one's work when all the world was beginning theirs. He went home under singing trees of birds.",1
1230,"He harried his deficient subscribers for payment, with a wild tenacity. He accepted their easy promises without question; he hunted them down in their own rooms, or in the rooms of a neighbor, he pressed so doggedly that, at length, sullenly or good-humoredly, they paid a part of their debt. This was more than any of his predecessors had accomplished, but he fretted nervously over his accounts until he found that he had become, for the circulation manager, the exemplar for indolent boys. As he dumped his desperately gathered pile of ""chicken feed"" upon the man's desk, his employer would turn accusingly to a delinquent boy, saying:  ""Look at that!",1
1231,"He does it every week! Niggers, too! His pallid face would flame with joy and pride. When he spoke to the great man his voice trembled. He could hardly speak.",1
1235,"He knew hunger. He knew thirst. A great flame rose in him. He cooled his hot face in the night by bubbling water jets. Alone, he wept sometimes with pain and ecstasy. At home the frightened silence of his childhood was now touched with savage restraint. He was wired like a race-horse. A white atom of inchoate fury would burst in him like a rocket, and for a moment he would be cursing mad.",1
1236,"What's wrong with him? Is it the Pentland crazy streak coming out? Helen asked, seated in Eliza's kitchen.",1
1239,"In this old witch-magic of the dark, he began to know the awful innocence of evil, the terrible youth of an ancient race; his lips slid back across his teeth, he prowled in darkness with loose swinging arms, and his eyes shone. Shame and terror, indefinable, surged through him. He could not face the question in his heart.",1
1241,"One Saturday evening, in the fading red of a summer twilight, he returned to one of these tenements, a rickety three-story shack, that cropped its two lower floors down a tall clay bank at the western ledge, near the whites. Two dozen men and women lived here. He was on the search for a woman named Ella Corpening. He had never been able to find her: she was weeks behind in her subscriptions. But her door stood open to-night: a warm waft of air and cooking food came up to him. He descended the rotten steps that climbed the bank.",1
1245,"Dat's my rent money,"" she said. Can't give you dat. Dollah- twenty! She brooded. Uh!  Uh! she grunted pleasantly. Don't seem lak it ought to be dat much. It is, though,"" he said, opening his account book.",1
1249,"Jelly Roll,"" said Ella Corpening. He moved his lips twice, unable to speak. She got up from her chair.",1
1258,"He strained back desperately against the door, drowning in her embrace. Get-'way nigger. Get-'way,"" he panted thickly.",1
1261,"23   [Greek text]   He did not tell the Leonards that he was working in the early morning. He knew they would oppose his employment, and that their opposition would manifest itself in the triumphant argument of lowered grades. Also, Margaret Leonard, he knew, would talk ominously of health undermined, of the promise of future years destroyed, of the sweet lost hours of morning sleep that could never be regained. He was really more robust now than he had ever been. He was heavier and stronger. But he sometimes felt a gnawing hunger for sleep: he grew heavy at mid-day, revived in the afternoon, but found it difficult to keep his sleepy brain fixed on a book after eight o'clock in the evening.",1
1264,"Thus, he made no confessions. He was still prison-pent. But he turned always to Margaret Leonard as toward the light: she saw the unholy fires that cast their sword-dance on his face, she saw the hunger and the pain, and she fed him--majestic crime!--on poetry.",1
1267,"The great lyrics of Burns he knew from music, from reading, or from hearing Gant recite them. But ""Tam O'Shanter"" Margaret Leonard read to him, her eyes sparkling with laughter as she read:        ""In hell they'll roast thee like a herrin'. The shorter Wordsworth pieces he had read at grammar school.",1
1269,"Those that he knew were:  ""When, in the chronicle of wasted time,"" ""To me, fair friend, you never can be old,"" ""Let me not to the marriage of true minds,"" ""The expense of spirit in a waste of shame,"" ""When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,"" ""Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? From you have I been absent in the spring,"" and ""That time of year thou mayest in me behold,"" the greatest of all, which Margaret brought him to, and which shot through him with such electric ecstasy when he came to ""Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang,"" that he could hardly hold his course unbroken through the rest of it. He read all the plays save Timon, Titus Andronicus, Coriolanus, and King John, but the only play that held his interest from first to last was King Lear. With most of the famous declamatory passages he had been familiar, for years, by Gant's recitation, and now they wearied him. And all the wordy pinwheels of the clowns, which Margaret laughed at dutifully, and exhibited as specimens of the master's swingeing wit, he felt vaguely were very dull. He never had any confidence in Shakespeare's humor--his Touchstones were not only windy fools, but dull ones.",1
1272,"Aye, Ben! Would he had blotted a hundred! A thousand!",1
1274,"He knew nothing of the Elizabethan drama beyond Shakespeare's plays. But he very early came to know a little of the poetry of Ben Jonson, whom Margaret looked on as a literary Falstaff, condoning, with the familiar weakness of the schoolmarm, his Gargantuan excess as a pardonable whimsy of genius. She was somewhat academically mirthful over the literary bacchanalia, as a professor in a Baptist college smacks his lips appetizingly and beams ruddily at his classes when he reads of sack and porter and tankards foaming with the musty ale. All this is part of the liberal tradition. Men of the world are broadminded. Witness Professor Albert Thorndyke Firkins, of the University of Chicago, at the Falcon in Soho. Smiling bravely, he sits over a half-pint of bitter beer, in the company of a racing tout, a sway- backed barmaid, broad in the stern, with adjustable teeth, and three companionable tarts from Lisle street, who are making the best of two pints of Guinness. With eager impatience he awaits the arrival of G. K. Chesterton and E. V. Lucas.",1
1282,"Sheba turned a sudden grinning face upon him. The little upstarts! It takes us to tell 'em, 'Gene,"" she said.",1
1288,"And, carefully:  ""It was the custom of the time, 'Gene. As a matter of fact, when you read some of the plays of his contemporaries you see how much purer he is than they are. But she avoided a word, a line, here and there. The slightly spotty Swan--muddied a little by custom. Then, too, the Bible.",1
1297,"But it was too long. Of Herrick, sealed of the tribe of Ben, he knew much more. The poetry sang itself. It was, he thought later, the most perfect and unfailing lyrical voice in the language--a clean, sweet, small, unfaltering note. It is done with the incomparable ease of an inspired child. The young men and women of our century have tried to recapture it, as they have tried to recapture Blake and, a little more successfully, Donne.",1
1299,"Their names dropped musically like small fat bird-notes through the freckled sunlight of a young world: prophetically he brooded on the sweet lost bird-cries of their names, knowing they never would return. Herrick, Crashaw, Carew, Suckling, Campion, Lovelace, Dekker. O sweet content, O sweet, O sweet content!",1
1301,"He read a dozen of Scott, and liked best of all Quentin Durward, because the descriptions of food were as beautiful and appetizing as any he had ever read. Eliza went to Florida again during his fourteenth year and left him to board with the Leonards. Helen was drifting, with crescent weariness and fear, through the cities of the East and Middle-West. She sang for several weeks in a small cabaret in Baltimore, she moved on to Philadelphia and thumped out popular tunes on a battered piano at the music counter of a five and ten cent store, with studious tongue out-thrust as she puzzled through new scores.",1
1305,"I'm not so sure of that,"" he said. Their wild laughter leaped like freed hounds. Tom Davis hurled himself violently downward over his desk. John Dorsey looked up, adding uncertainly his absent falsetto mirth.",1
1306,"From time to time, in spite of himself, they taught him a little German, a language of which he had been quite happily ignorant. The lesson had become for them a daily hunger: they worked it over with mad intensity, speeding and polishing their translation in order to enjoy his bewilderment. Sometimes, deliberately, they salted their pages with glib false readings, sometimes they interpolated passages of wild absurdity, waiting exultantly for his cautious amendment of a word that did not exist.",1
1307,"Slowly the moonlight crept up the chair in which the old man was sitting, reaching his knees, his breast, and finally,""--Guy Doak looked up slyly at his tutor, ""giving him a good punch in the eye. No-o,"" said John Dorsey, rubbing his chin, ""not exactly. 'Catching him squarely in the eye' gets the idiom better, I think. Tom Davis thrust a mouthful of strange gurgling noises into his desk, and waited for the classic evasion.",1
1311,"The mountains,"" observed John Dorsey, touched, in a happy moment, by the genius of the place, ""have been the traditional seat of Liberty. Eugene turned his face toward the western ranges. He heard, far off, a whistle, a remote, thunder on the rails.",1
1322,"Guy Doak toyed gently at his belly with his right hand, and stroked his round chin slowly with his left. Now let me see,"" he whined, ""what he gives on this. Their laughter rang around the walls.",1
1324,"Each afternoon he read the names of delinquents, amid a low mutter of sullen protest, and stated their penalties. Once Eugene got through an entire day without a mark. He stood triumphantly before Leonard while the master searched the record.",1
1326,"Eugene's wild eyes were shot with tears of anger and surprise. He never forgot. Miss Amy yawned, and smiled on him with slow powerful affectionate contempt.",1
1327,"Go on! she said, in her broad, lazy accent. I don't want to fool with you any more. You're not worth powder enough to blow you up. Margaret came in, her face furrowed deeply between smoke-dark eyes, full of tender sternness and hidden laughter.",1
1329,drawled Miss Amy. He can learn anything. He's lazy--that's what it is. Just plain lazy. She smacked his buttock smartly with a ruler.,1
1332,Go on. I've seen enough of you. She made a strong weary gesture of dismissal.,1
1338,"He turned, and, crying fiercely in his throat, tore down the road with bounding strides. All the dusk blurred in her eyes. Leave him alone! she whispered to no one. Leave him alone! A light wind of April fanned over the hill.",1
1339,"There was a smell of burning leaves and rubble around the school. In the field on the hill flank behind the house a plowman drove his big horse with loose clanking traces around a lessening square of dry fallow earth. Gee, woa. His strong feet followed after. The big share bit cleanly down, cleaving a deep spermy furrow of moist young earth along its track.",1
1343,"See if Mrs. Leonard wants you. He fastened his brutal grip with keen hunger into the boy's thin arm. April is the cruellest of months. Eugene winced, moved away, and then stood quietly, checked by memory of the old revolt from awe.",1
1345,"Yes, you scamp. Go on,"" she said. Tell me, boy,"" she coaxed, softly, ""can't you be a little bit better?""  ""Yes'm,"" he promised, easily.",1
1346,I'll try. Say not the struggle naught availeth. She smiled at his high mettled prancing nervousness.,1
1348,"As he leaped down the stairs into the yard he heard Dirk Barnard's lusty splashing bathtub solo. Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song. Tyson Leonard, having raked into every slut's corner of nature with a thin satisfied grin, emerged from the barn with a cap full of fresh eggs. A stammering cackle of protest followed him from angry hens who found too late that men betray. At the barnside, under the carriage shed, ""Pap"" Rheinhart tightened the bellyband of his saddled brown mare, swinging strongly into the saddle, and with a hard scramble of hoofs, came up the hill, wheeled in behind the house, and drew up by Eugene.",1

1359,"He wore a derby hat jammed over his pert freckled face. As he spoke he took a ragged twist of tobacco from his pocket and bit off a large chew with a rough air of relish. Want a chew, Jule?"" he said.",1
1360,"Julius took the twist, wiped off his mouth with a loose male grin, and crammed a large quid into his cheek. He brought me roots of relish sweet. Want one, Highpockets? he asked Eugene, grinning.",1
1363,"Who's going my way?"" said Julius Arthur. Come on, 'Gene. The car's down here. I'll take you home. Thanks, but I can't,"" said Eugene.",1
1368,"A street-sweeper walked along slowly uphill, beside his deep wedge- bodied cart.

1374,"From the top of the hill at the left, the swelling unction of the Methodist organ welled up remotely from the choir, accompanied by a fruity contralto voice, much in demand at funerals. Abide with me. Most musical of mourners, weep again!",1
1382,"The best people in this town are church members,"" he said earnestly. It's a fine thing. Why?"" said Eugene, with an idle curiosity.",1
1383,"Because,"" said George Graves, ""you get to know all the people who are worth a damn. Worth being damned, he thought quickly. A quaint idea.",1
1387,"A tiny breeze blew back the thin curtains, and revealed him, white- jacketed, competent, drill in hand. Do you feel that? he said tenderly.",1
1389,"You can figure on five dollars' worth each, can't you?""  ""Easy!"" said George Graves. More than that. He brooded lusciously a moment. That's a lot of money,"" he said.",1
1391,"There's good money in undertaking,"" said George Graves. Mr. Powell's well off. Eugene's eyes were glued on the lantern face of ""Horse"" Hines.",1
1393,"You can't tell,"" George Graves said gloomily. It's been known to happen. They've dug them up later and found them turned over on their faces. Eugene shuddered.",1
1401,"They're trying to get the Princess Madeleine into Society,"" said George Graves. Hell fire! Eugene cried, grinning. Let's let her in, if that's all she wants. We belong to the Younger Set, don't we?""  ""You may,"" said George Graves, reeling with laughter, ""but I don't.",1
1403,"You oughtn't to say that, 'Gene,"" he gasped. He shook his head reproachfully. Your mother's a fine woman. During the course of the evening, the Honorable George Graves, the talented scion of one of our oldest and wealthiest families, the Chesterfield Graveses, ($10 a week and up), rendered a few appropriate selections on the jews-harp.",1
1406,"Come, delicate death, serenely arriving, arriving. Horse"" Hines came out quickly on long flapping legs, and opened the doors behind. In another moment, with the help of the two men on the driver's seat, he had lowered the long wicker basket gently, and vanished, quietly, gravely, into the fragrant gloom of his establishment.",1
1408,"He caught and fixed the instant. A telegraph messenger wheeled vigorously in from the avenue with pumping feet, curved widely into the alley at his right, jerking his wheel up sharply as he took the curb and coasted down to the delivery boy's entrance. And post o'er land and ocean without rest. Milton, thou shouldst be living at this hour.",1

A solitary fly darted swiftly about the greasy cover of a glass humidor, under which a leathery quarter of mince pie lay weltering. Spring had come.",1

1439,"Passed, on catspaw rubber tread, from the long dark bookstore, Professor L. B. Dunn, principal of Graded School No. 3, Montgomery Avenue. He smiled coldly at them with a gimlet narrowing of his spectacled eyes. The tell-tale cover of The New Republic peeked from his pocket. Clamped under his lean and freckled arm were new library copies of The Great Illusion, by Norman Angell, and The Ancient Grudge, by Owen Wister. A lifelong advocate of a union of the two great English-speaking (sic) nations, making together irresistibly for peace, truth, and righteousness in a benevolent but firm authority over the less responsible elements of civilization, he passed, the Catholic man, pleasantly dedicated to the brave adventuring of minds and the salvaging of mankind. Ah, yes!",1

1460,"But--at the entrance, standing in the alcove by the magazine rack, Mr. Paul Goodson, of the Dependable Life, closed his long grinning dish-face abruptly, and ceased talking. He doffed his hat without effusiveness, as did his companion, Coston Smathers, the furniture man (you furnish the girl, we furnish the house). They were both Baptists.",1
1465,"Yes,"" said George Graves absently, ""a little bit. I don't like it. He lifted his brooding eyes.",1
1468,"No.  Not now. You'd have to move all the buildings back. Wonder how much it would cost?"" said George Graves thoughtfully.",1
1470,"He was a small man, with a gray, mean face, violent and bitter. A chronic intestinal sourness seemed to have left its print upon his features. In my opinion, it's all propaganda. Those Germans are too damn good for them, that's all. They're beginning to call for calf-rope. When that day comes,"" Professor Dunn implacably continued, ""remember what I told you.",1
1474,"They went away and joined the French army. They're in the Foreign Legion. They're in the aviation part of it,"" said Eugene.",1

1485,"What's yours? he said irritably. I want a chock-lut milk,"" said Eugene.",1
1487,"The enormous crime had been committed. And, for almost a year, Eugene had been maintaining a desperate neutrality. His heart, however, was not neutral. The fate of civilization, it appeared, hung in the balance.",1
1494,"John Dorsey Leonard was untroubled. You wait! he said confidently. You just wait, my sonny. That old fellow Joffer knows what he's about. This is just what he's been waiting for. Now he's got them where he wants them. Eugene wondered for what subtle reason a French general might want a German army in Paris.",1

I suppose they haven't got the news yet. He grinned maliciously. What do you want, Ben?""  ""I'm thinking of going to Canada and enlisting,"" said Ben.",1
1510,"What do you want to do that for, Ben?"" he said. Ben got up suddenly, and went to the window. He cast his cigarette away into the court. It struck the cement well with a small dry plop. When he turned around, his sallow face had gone white and passionate.",1
1514,"What am I? a mindreader? A spiritualist? I'm your physician, not your priest. I've seen them born, and I've seen them die. What happens to them before or after, I can't say. Damn that!"" said Ben.  ""What happens to them in between?""  ""You're as great an authority on that as I am, Ben,"" said Coker.",1
1517,"That's what I'm asking you, Coker. Why must he?""  ""Why,"" said Coker, ""in order to work nine hours a day in a newspaper office, sleep nine hours, and enjoy the other six in washing, shaving, dressing, eating at the Greasy Spoon, loafing in front of Wood's, and occasionally taking the Merry Widow to see Francis X. Bushman. Isn't that reason enough for any man? If a man's hard-working and decent, and invests his money in the Building and Loan every week, instead of squandering it on cigarettes, coca-cola, and Kuppenheimer clothes, he may own a little home some day. Coker's voice sank to a hush of reverence. He may even have his own car, Ben.  Think of that! He can get in it, and ride, and ride, and ride. He can ride all over these damned mountains. He can be very, very happy. He can take exercise regularly in the Y. M. C. A. and think only clean thoughts. He can marry a good pure woman and have any number of fine sons and daughters, all of whom may be brought up in the Baptist, Methodist, or Presbyterian faiths, and given splendid courses in Economics, Commercial Law, and the Fine Arts, at the State university. There's plenty to live for, Ben. There's something to keep you busy every moment. You're a great wit, Coker,"" Ben said, scowling.",1
1524,"Quit your kidding, Coker,"" he said. I'm three times seven, you know. Am I fit to go?""  ""What's the rush?"" said Coker.",1
1525,"The war's not over yet. We may get into it before long. Why not wait a bit?""  ""That means I'm not fit,"" said Ben.",1
1526,"What's the matter with me, Coker?""  ""Nothing,"" said Coker carefully. You're a bit thin. A little run down, aren't you, Ben? You need a little meat on those bones, son. You can't sit on a stool at the Greasy Spoon, with a cigarette in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other, and get fat. Am I all right or not, Coker?""  Coker's long death's-head widened in a yellow grin.",1
1528,"His own were sick with fear. But he said bitingly:  ""Thanks, Coker. You're a lot of help. I appreciate what you've done a lot. As a doctor, you're a fine first baseman. Coker grinned.",1
1531,"He found a substitute for his paper route. Come on!"" said Max Isaacs, whom he still occasionally saw. We're going to have a good time, son. Yeah, man!"" said Malvin Bowden, whose mother was conducting the tour.",1
1534,"His father was a plumber. He did not want to be a plumber. He wanted to join the navy and see the world. In the navy, a man was given good pay and a good education. He learned a trade. He got good food and good clothing. It was all given to him free, for nothing.",1
1536,"It had been years since he was. She smiled tremulously. Yes'm,"" said Eugene. Can I go? It's only for five days. I've got the money. He thrust his hand into his pocket, feeling.",1
1539,"For heaven's sake! Ben cried. It's the kid's own money. Let him do what he likes with it. If he wants to throw it out the damned window, it's his own business. She clasped her hands thoughtfully upon her waist and stared away, pursing her lips.",1
1543,"Don't waste your money,"" she said. Here's a little extra. You may need it. Come here, you little thug!"" said Ben.  Scowling, his quick hands worked busily at the boy's stringy tie.",1
1546,"Now, by night, he was riding once more into the South. The day- coach was hot, full of the weary smell of old red plush. People dozed painfully, distressed by the mournful tolling of the bell, and the grinding halts. A baby wailed thinly. Its mother, a gaunt wisp-haired mountaineer, turned the back of the seat ahead, and bedded the child on a spread newspaper. Its wizened face peeked dirtily out of its swaddling discomfort of soiled jackets and pink ribbon. It wailed and slept. At the front of the car, a young hill-man, high-boned and red, clad in corduroys and leather leggings, shelled peanuts steadily, throwing the shells into the aisle. People trod through them with a sharp masty crackle. The boys, bored, paraded restlessly to the car-end for water. There was a crushed litter of sanitary drinking-cups upon the floor, and a stale odor from the toilets.",1
1550,"Light broke against the east, in a murky rim. The far dark was eaten cleanly away. The horizon sky was barred with hard fierce strips of light. Still buried in night, they looked across at the unimpinging sheet of day. They looked under the lifted curtain at brightness. They were knifed sharply away from it. Then, gently, light melted across the land like dew. The world was gray.",1
1557,"We promised to meet them. Oh, damn the Navy Yard! he groaned. I'd rather sleep. So would I!"" she agreed.",1
1558,"She yawned luxuriously, stretching her plump arms above her head. I'm so sleepy. I could stretch out anywhere. She looked meaningly at the bed.",1
1559,"He wakened at once, sensuously alert. He lifted himself upon one elbow: a hot torrent of blood swarmed through his cheeks. His pulses beat thickly.",1
1560,"We're all alone up here,"" said Louise smiling. We've got the whole floor to ourselves. Why don't you lie down and take a nap, if you're still sleepy?"" he asked.",1
1570,"I've got an ugly face,"" she said invitingly. You haven't got an ugly face. You have a pretty face,"" said Eugene firmly. Anyway, the face doesn't matter much with me,"" he added, subtly.",1
1575,"Lord!"" said Eugene, staring with keen interest at the garter. I never saw any like that before. That's pretty. He gulped noisily. Don't those things hurt you, Louise?""  ""Uh-uh,"" she said, as if puzzled, ""why?""  ""I should think they'd cut into your skin,"" he said.",1
1585,"She smiled. No,"" she said. I may be mad, but I won't do that. He had become inarticulate; his voice went off into a speechless jargon. Gasping, stammering, with contorted and writhing face, he sought for speech.",1
1594,"She told me so. I don't care,"" said Malvin Bowden, ""she's no such thing. She's twenty-one. I reckon I ought to know. My folks have known her for five years. She had a baby when she was eighteen. Aw!"" said Max Isaacs.",1
1596,"Without marryin' her or anything?""  ""He didn't do nothing for her. He ran away,"" said Malvin Bowden. Her people are raising the kid now. Great Day!"" said Max Isaacs slowly.",1
1597,"Then, sternly, he added, ""A man who'd do a thing like that ought to be shot. You're right!"" said Malvin Bowden. They loafed along the Battery, along the borders of ruined Camelot.",1
1598,"Those are nice old places,"" said Max Isaacs. They've been good houses in their day. He looked greedily at wrought-iron gateways; the old lust of his childhood for iron-scraps awoke.",1
1601,"You can TELL she's a lady,"" said Max Isaacs. I bet she's never turned her hand over. An old family,"" said Eugene gently.",1
1602,"The Southern aristocracy. An old negro came by, fringed benevolently by white whiskers. A good old man--an ante-bellum darkey. Dear Lord, their number was few in these unhappy days.",1
1605,"If things had been even, we'd have beaten them. They didn't beat us,"" said Max Isaacs. We wore ourselves out beating them. We were defeated,"" said Eugene, quietly, ""not beaten.",1
1606,"Max Isaacs stared at him dumbly. Aw!"" he said. They left the little boat, and ground away toward the beach in a street-car. The land had grown dry and yellow in the enervation of the summer. The foliage was coated with dust: they rattled past cheap summer houses, baked and blistered, stogged drearily in the sand. They were small, flimsy, a multitudinous vermin--all with their little wooden sign of lodging. The Ishkabibble,"" ""Seaview,"" ""Rest Haven,"" ""Atlantic Inn,""--Eugene looked at them, reading with weariness the bleached and jaded humor of their names.",1
1608,"Malvin Bowden leaped joyously from the car. Last one in's a rotten egg! he cried, and streaked for the bathhouse.",1
1609,"Kings! I've got kings, son,"" yelled Max Isaacs. He held up his crossed fingers. The beach was bare: two or three concessions stood idly open for business. The sky curved over them, a cloudless blue burnished bowl. The sea offshore was glazed emerald: the waves rode heavily in, thickening murkily as they turned with sunlight and sediment to a beachy yellow.",1
1610,"They walked slowly down the beach toward the bathhouse. The tranquil, incessant thunder of the sea made in them a lonely music. Seawards, their eyes probed through the seething glare.",1
1618,"Louise came from the bathhouse and walked slowly toward him. She came proudly, her warm curves moulded into her bathing-suit: her legs were covered with stockings of green silk. Far out, beyond the ropes, Max Isaacs lifted his white heavy arms, and slid swiftly through a surging wall of green water. His body glimmered greenly for a moment; he stood erect wiping his eyes and shaking water from his ears.",1
1622,"What did they tell you about me?"" she said. Did they talk about me?""  ""I don't care,"" he said. I don't care about that. I like you. You won't remember me, honey, when you start going with the girls.",1
1624,"I'll never forget you, Louise. So long as I live. Their hearts were filled with the lonely thunder of the sea.",1
1631,"Don't worry, old boy! she said, ""you're going to be as good as you ever were, after this. She fed him with her life, her hope, her love.",1
1632,"He was almost tranquil when they wheeled him in to his operation. But the little gray-haired man looked, shook his head regretfully, and trimmed deftly. All right! he said, four minutes later, to his assistant. Close the wound. Gant was dying of cancer.",1
1634,"There,"" he said pointing, ""is where I spent part of my boyhood. Old Jeff Streeter's hotel stood about there,"" he pointed. Dig down! said Helen, grinning.",1
1639,"Eugene tore the Chandos portrait from the pages of the Independent and nailed it to the calcimined wall of the backroom. Then, still full of the great echoing paean of Ben Jonson's, he scrawled below it in large trembling letters:  ""My Shakespeare, rise! The large plump face--""as damned silly a head as ever I looked at""--stared baldly at him with goggle eyes, the goatee pointed ripe with hayseed vanity. But, lit by the presence, Eugene plunged back into the essay littered across his table.",1
1649,"I'll fix you,"" said Miss Amy. I've got just the thing for you. She gave him a full baggy clown's suit, of green linen.",1
1652,"Oh, Lord!"" she groaned, wet-cheeked. I don't believe I ever saw--""    The pageant was performed on the embowered lawns of the Manor House. Dr. George B. Rockham stood in a green hollow--a natural amphitheatre. His audience sat on the turf of the encircling banks. As the phantom cavalcade of poetry and the drama wound down to him, Dr. George B. Rockham disposed of each character neatly in descriptive pentameter verse. He was dressed in the fashion of the Restoration--a period he coveted because it understood the charms of muscular calves. His heavy legs bulged knottily below a coy fringe of drawer-ruffles.",1
1654,"He turned, with a comical squint, on Eugene:  ""Hal,"" said he, ""you're a hell of a looking prince. You're no beauty, Jack,"" said Eugene. Behind him, Julius Arthur (Macbeth), drew his sword with a flourish.",1
1657,"Swinging gently in her side-saddle, Rosalind, on horseback, a ripe little beauty from the convent, smiled warmly at him. Looking, he forgot. Below them, on the road, the crowded press loosened slowly, broke off in minute fragments, and disappeared into the hidden gulch of Dr. George Rockham's receiving voice. With fat hammy sonority he welcomed them.",1
1662,"Sh-h!  Sh-h!"" hissed Miss Ida Nelson. What the hell does she think she is?"" said Julius Arthur, ""a steam valve?""  Eugene looked attentively at the shapely legs of the page, Viola. Wow!"" said Ralph Rolls, with his accustomed audibility. Look who's here!",1
1663,"She looked on them all with a pert impartial smile. But she never told her love. Miss Ida Nelson caught the doctor's stealthy sign. Carefully, in slow twos, she fed them down to him.",1
1664,"The Moor of Venice (Mr. George Graves), turned his broad back upon their jibes, and lurched down with sullen-sheepish grin, unable to conceal the massive embarrassment of his calves. Tell him who you are, Villa,"" said Doc Hines. You look like Jack Johnson. The town, in its first white shirting of Spring, sat on the turfy banks, and looked down gravely upon the bosky little comedy of errors; the encircling mountains, and the gods thereon, looked down upon the slightly larger theatre of the town; and, figuratively, from mountains that looked down on mountains, the last stronghold of philosophy, the author of this chronicle looked down on everything.",1
1669,"Who are you? he said hoarsely, holding a hairy hand carefully beside his mouth. Prince Hal,"" said Eugene, likewise hoarsely and behind his hand.",1
1675,"Well, for G-g-god's sake,"" said Luke after a moment. Look who's here! They embraced heartily,  ""Why, what on earth!",1
1678,"Winking, he turned suddenly, and with an idiotic laugh, tickled Eliza sharply. Get away! she shrieked.",1
1679,"He chortled madly. I'll declare, boy! she said fretfully. I believe you're crazy. I'll vow I do!",1
1684,"In for what?"" asked Luke. I've gone and done it at last,"" she said. Mercy!"" shrieked Eliza. You're not married, are you?""  ""Not yet,"" said Helen, ""but I will be soon.",1
1687,"They live in style, I tell you. There are two servants in that house all the time. The old lady doesn't turn her hand over. Where are you going to live?"" said Eliza sharply.",1
1688,"With his folks?""  ""Well, I should say not! I should say not! said Helen slowly and emphatically. Good heavens, mama! she continued irritably. I want a home of my own. Can't you realize that? I've been doing for others all my life. Now I'm going to let them do for me. I want no in-laws about. No, sir! she said emphatically.",1
1689,"Luke bit his nails nervously. Well, he's g-g-getting a great g-g-girl,"" he said. I hope he has sense enough to realize that. Moved, she laughed bigly, ironically.",1
1694,"Why, no-o.  I never said--"" Eliza began, flustered and conciliatory. You've spent your life f-f-finking of others and not of yourself,"" said Luke. That's the trouble. They don't appreciate it. Well, I'm not going to any longer.",1
1696,"I wonder what he's going to say?""  He said very little. The Gants, after initial surprise, moulded new events very quickly into the texture of their lives. Abysmal change widened their souls out in a brooding unconsciousness.",1
1700,"With equal slow gravity he greeted each one. They were somewhat awed by his lordliness. Luke, however, burst out uncontrollably:  ""You're g-g-getting a fine girl, Mr. B-b-barton.",1
1702,"In an awkward silence he turned, grinning amiably, on Eugene.  ""Have a cigar?"" he asked, taking three long powerful weeds from his upper vest pocket, and holding them out in his clean twitching fingers. Thanks,"" said Eugene with a dissipated leer, ""I'll smoke a Camel. He took a package of cigarettes from his pocket.",1
1703,"Gravely, Hugh Barton held a match for him. Why do you wear the big hat?"" asked Eugene. Psychology,"" he said. It makes 'em talk. I tell you what!"" said Eliza, beginning to laugh.",1
1705,The phrase seemed to describe an action of modified assault and restrained pillage. They liked him very much. They all went into the house.,1
1706,"Hugh Barton's mother was in her seventy-fourth year, but she had the strength of a healthy woman of fifty, and the appetite of two of forty. She was a powerful old lady, six feet tall, with the big bones of a man, and a heavy full-jawed face, sensuous and complacent, and excellently equipped with a champing mill of strong yellow horse-teeth. It was cake and pudding to see her at work on corn on the cob. A slight paralysis had slowed her tongue and thickened her speech a little, so that she spoke deliberately, with a ponderous enunciation of each word. This deformity, which she carefully hid, added to, rather than subtracted from, the pontifical weight of her opinions: she was an earnest Republican-- in memory of her departed mate--and she took a violent dislike to any one who opposed her political judgment. When thwarted or annoyed in any way, the heavy benevolence of her face was dislodged by a thunder-cloud of petulance, and her wide pouting underlip rolled out like a window-shade. But, as she barged slowly along, one big hand gripping a heavy stick on which she leaned her massive weight, she was an impressive dowager.",1
1709,"O-o-h! she said. He was a ter-rib-bul man. He had, they inferred, been given to hellish practices.",1
1718,"It's a d-d-damn shame!"" said Luke loyally. At this moment Mrs. Barton, kindly but authoritative, called from the veranda:  ""Hel-en! Where are you, Hel-en?""  ""O gotohell.",1
1724,"To Eugene was assigned the task of digging this couple out of their burrow. He waited sternly outside the girl's room, watching the shadow dance at the door crack. At the end of the sixth hour, the besieged surrendered--the man came out. The boy--pallid, but proud of his trust--told the house-defiler that he must go. The young man agreed with cheerful alcoholism. He went at once.",1
1730,"He was going to the capital of the State. And it had already been determined, chiefly by Gant, that Eugene was going to the State University. But Hugh and Helen did not go honeymooning the next morning, as they had planned. During the night, as she lay at Dixieland, old Mrs. Barton was taken with a violent, a retching sickness. For once, her massive digestive mechanism failed to meet the heavy demands she had put upon it during the pre-nuptial banqueting. She came near death.",1
1731,"Hugh and Helen returned abruptly next morning to a scene of dismal tinsellings and jaded lilies. Helen hurled her vitality into the sick woman's care; dominant, furious, all-mastering, she blew back her life into her. Within three days, Mrs. Barton was out of danger; but her complete recovery was slow, ugly, and painful. As the days lengthened out wearily, the girl became more and more bitter over her thwarted honeymoon. Rushing out of the sick-room, she would enter Eliza's kitchen with writhen face, unable to control her anger:  ""That damned old woman!",1
1735,"O gotohell!"" said the girl, sotto-voce. Urr-p!  Urr-p! She burst suddenly into tears:  ""Is it going to be like this always! I sometimes believe the judgment of God is against us all. Papa was right. Pshaw!"" said Eliza, wetting her fingers, and threading a needle before the light.",1
1737,"I'm coming! the girl cried cheerfully, turning an angry grin on Eliza as she went. It was funny. It was ugly. It was terrible.",1
1744,"Gant would not be persuaded. He's old enough,"" he said. When I was his age I had been earning my living for years. I'm getting old. I won't be here much longer. I want him to begin to make a name for himself before I die. He refused stubbornly to consider any postponement.",1
1749,"Four years later, when he was graduated, he had passed his adolescence, the kiss of love and death burned on his lips, and he was still a child. When it was at last plain that Gant's will was on this inflexible, Margaret Leonard had said, quietly: Well, then, go your ways, boy. Go your ways. God bless you. She looked a moment at his long thin figure and turned to John Dorsey Leonard with wet eyes:  ""Do you remember that shaver in knee-pants who came to us four years ago?",1
1752,"Eugene,"" she continued, ""we could not love you more if you were our own child. We wanted to keep you with us for another year, but since that cannot be, we are sending you out with our hopes pinned to you. Oh, boy, you are fine. There is no atom in you that is not fine. A glory and a chrism of bright genius rest upon you. God bless you: the world is yours. The proud words of love and glory sank like music to his heart, evoking their bright pictures of triumph, and piercing him with the bitter shame of his concealed desires.",1
1755,"Gant still occupied his sitting-room, but the rest of the house he had rented to a sprightly gray-haired widow of forty. She looked after them beautifully, but she served Ben with an especial tenderness. At night, on the cool veranda, Eugene would find them below the ripening clusters, hear the quiet note of his brother's voice, his laugh, see the slow red arc of his cigarette in darkness.",1
1757,"But to Eugene, Ben talked more freely than ever before. As they sat upon their beds at night, reading and smoking before they slept, all of the pain and bitterness of Benjamin Gant's life burst out in violent denunciation. He began to speak with slow sullen difficulty, halting over his words as he did when he read, but speaking more rapidly as his quiet voice became more passionate.",1
1759,"He laughed silently, with a thin and bitter contortion of his lips. Papa said that a lot of boys pay their own way through college by waiting on tables and so on. Perhaps I can do something like that. Ben turned over on his side until he faced his brother, propping himself on his thin hairy forearm.",1
1761,"For YOU, you little idiot!"" said Ben, scowling at him in disgust. They're doing it all for themselves. Don't let them get away with that. They think you'll make good and bring a lot of credit to them some day. They're rushing you into it two years too soon, as it is. No, you take everything you can get. The rest of us never had anything, but I want to see you get all that's coming to you. My God! he cried furiously.",1
1763,To hell with it all! he said. What in God's name are we living for!,1
1771,"Few of the university's sons had been distinguished in the nation's life--there had been an obscure President of the United States, and a few Cabinet members, but few had sought such distinction: it was glory enough to be a great man in one's State. Nothing beyond mattered very much. In this pastoral setting a young man was enabled to loaf comfortably and delightfully through four luxurious and indolent years. There was, God knows, seclusion enough for monastic scholarship, but the rare romantic quality of the atmosphere, the prodigal opulence of Springtime, thick with flowers and drenched in a fragrant warmth of green shimmering light, quenched pretty thoroughly any incipient rash of bookishness. Instead, they loafed and invited their souls or, with great energy and enthusiasm, promoted the affairs of glee-clubs, athletic teams, class politics, fraternities, debating societies, and dramatic clubs. And they talked--always they talked, under the trees, against the ivied walls, assembled in their rooms, they talked--in limp sprawls-- incessant, charming, empty Southern talk; they talked with a large easy fluency about God, the Devil, and philosophy, the girls, politics, athletics, fraternities and the girls--My God! how they talked!",1
1782,"My dear boy!"" said Mr. Torrington with gentle amazement. He shrugged his shoulders and became politely indifferent. Very well, if he liked. Of course, he thought it rather a pity to waste one's time so when they were really doing some first-rate things. That was JUST the trouble, however. The appeal of a man like that was mainly to the unformed taste, the uncritical judgment. He had a flashy attraction for the immature. Oh, yes! Undoubtedly an amusing fellow. Clever--yes, but hardly significant. And--didn't he think--a trifle noisy? Or had he noticed that? Yes--there was to be sure an amusing Celtic strain, not without charm, but unsound. He was not in line with the best modern thought.",1
1784,"Gant. Oh yes, to be sure,--Gant. He held out his plump limp hand. He did hope Mr. Gant would call on him. Perhaps he'd be able to advise him on some of the little problems that, he knew, were constantly cropping up during the first year. Above all, he mustn't get discouraged.",1
1787,"And later, in an expectant pause, he would deepen his arched brows portentously, stare up mockingly under his bushy eyebrows at his expectant audience, and say, in a deep sardonic voice: And now, I am going to request Brother Gant to favor us with one of his polished and scholarly translations. These heavy jibes were hard to bear because, of all the class, two dozen or more, Brother Gant was the only one to prepare his work without the aid of a printed translation.",1
1789,"Splendid! You are riding a good pony--but a little too smoothly, my boy. You ride a little too well. The class sniggered heavily.",1
1790,"When he could stand it no longer, he sought the man out one day after the class. See here, sir! See here! he began in a voice choking with fury and exasperation. Sir--I assure you--"" he thought of all the grinning apes in the class, palming off profitably their stolen translations, and he could not go on.",1
1795,"Thereafter, when he read, faltering prettily here and there over a phrase, until his instructor should come to his aid, the satanic professor listened gravely and attentively, nodding his head in approval from time to time, and saying, with great satisfaction, when he had finished:  ""Good, Mr. Gant. Very good. That shows what a little real work will do.",1
1803,"With fine enthusiasm, but poor judgment, Eugene paid the widow two months in advance. Her name was Bradley: she was a flabby petulant woman with a white face and heart-disease. But her food was excellent. Mrs. Bradley's student son answered to his initial letters--""G. T.""  G. T. Bradley, a member of the sophomore class, was a surly scowling youth of nineteen--a mixture, in equal parts, of servility and insolence. His chief, but thwarted, ambition was to be elected to membership in a fraternity. Having failed to win recognition by the exercise of his natural talents, he was driven by an extraordinary obsession that fame and glory would come to him if he were known as the slave-driver of a number of Freshmen.",1
1806,"You take things too seriously, 'Gene,"" he said. Yes,"" said Eugene. I don't want you to go having hard feelings, 'Gene. Let's shake hands and be friends. He thrust his hand out stiffly.",1
1814,"Boy, you're going to choke to death on one of those some day. He shook his head slowly and sadly, then continued with a rough laugh:  ""If old man Trivett knew what you were doing with his money, damn if he wouldn't bust a gut. Gene!"" said Jim Trivett, ""what the hell do you know about this damned English, anyway?""  ""What he doesn't know about it,"" said Tom Grant, ""you could write out on the back of a postage stamp.",1
1819,I've told you I'd go with you! Eugene said angrily. He trembled a little.,1
1821,Jim Trivett's loose smile widened. He spat into the wood-box. Gawd! he said. They'll think Spring is here when they see old Legs. They'll need a stepladder to git at him. Tom Grant was shaken with hard fat laughter.,1
1826,"They paused before a two-storey frame house. A lamp burned dimly behind lowered yellow shades, casting a murky pollen out upon the smoky air. Wait a minute,"" said Jim Trivett, in a low voice, ""I'll find out. They heard scuffling steps through the leaves.",1
1830,"Does Miss Lily know you're comin'? the negro asked. No,"" said Jim Trivett. Do you know her?""  ""Yes, suh,"" said the negro.",1
1834,"Come on. He slipped a coin into the negro's hand, thanking him. Eugene looked for a moment into the black broad friendliness of the man's face. He had a flash of warmth through his cold limbs. The black bawd had done his work eagerly and kindly: over their bought unlovely loves lay the warm shadow of his affection.",1
1844,"I wouldn't call him more'n fifteen, to look at his face. Ain't he got a little face, though? she demanded in a slow puzzled voice.",1
1847,"Well,"" said Jim Trivett, ""let's git goin'. He embraced Thelma again. They fumbled amorously.",1
1855,"The massed coals caved in the hearth. The lost bright wonder died. When he went down stairs, he found Jim Trivett waiting in the hall, holding Thelma by the hand. Lily led them out quietly, after peering through the lattice into the fog, and listening for a moment.",1
1857,"They went out softly, treading gently until they reached the road. The fog had thickened: the air was saturated with fine stinging moisture. At the corner, in the glare of the street-lamp, Jim Trivett released his breath with loud relief, and stepped forward boldly.",1
1862,"A cup of coffee will fix you up,"" he added with cheerful conviction. They mounted the hill slowly. The light from winking cornerlamps fell with a livid stare across the fronts of the squalid houses.",1
1864,"Surprised, Jim Trivett stared at him. Why not? There's nothing in that,"" he said. Pshaw, boy, any one's likely to get sick. Yes, I know.",1
1869,"He did not know where to turn. He paced his chill room at night, muttering, until Eliza's troubled face appeared above her wrapper. His father was gentler, older than he had ever seen him; his pain had returned on him. He was absent and sorrowful. He talked perfunctorily with his son about college. Speech choked in Eugene's throat. He stammered a few answers and fled from the house and the vacant fear in Gant's eyes. He walked prodigiously, day and night, in an effort to command his own fear. He believed himself to be rotting with a leprosy. And there was nothing to do but rot. There was no cure. For such had been the instruction of the moralists of his youth.",1
1870,"He walked with aimless desperation, unable to quiet for a moment his restless limbs. He went up on the eastern hills that rose behind Niggertown. A winter's sun labored through the mist. Low on the meadows, and high on the hills, the sunlight lay on the earth like milk.",1
1874,"I've been with a woman,"" said Eugene. Sit down, 'Gene,"" said Ben quietly, after a moment. Don't be a little idiot. You're not going to die, you know. When did this happen?""  The boy blurted out his confession.",1
1876,"It was like this,"" he began, ""if I had known, but at that time I didn't--of course I know it was my own fault for--""  ""Oh, for God's sake!"" said Ben impatiently. Dry up! I don't want to hear about it. I'm not your damned Guardian Angel. The news was comforting.",1
1891,"But, then, you all are. When they came out on the street again, Ben said:  ""Have you had anything to eat?""  ""No,"" said Eugene. When did you eat last? Some time yesterday,"" said Eugene.",1
1899,"Freed and alone, he looked with a boding detachment at all the possessed and possessing world about him. Life hung for his picking fingers like a strange and bitter fruit. THEY--the great clan huddled there behind the stockade for warmth and safety--could hunt him down some day and put him to death: he thought they would.",1
1901,"There came and sat beside him Tom French, his handsome face vested in the hard insolence of money. He was followed by his court jester, Roy Duncan, the slave with the high hard cackle. Hello, Gant,"" said Tom French harshly. Been to Exeter lately?"" Scowling, he winked at grinning Roy.",1
1902,"Yes,"" said Eugene, ""I've been there lately, and I'm on my way there now. What's it to you, French? Discomfited by this hard defiance, the rich man's son drew back.",1
1904,"If I need cleaning,"" said Eugene, ""I can always use the Gold Dust Twins, can't I?  French and Duncan, the Gold Dust Twins--who never do any work. The cluster of grinning students, the young impartial brutes who had gathered about them on the seats back and front, laughed loudly. That's right! That's right! Talk to them, 'Gene!"" said Zeno Cochran, softly. He was a tall lad of twenty, slender and powerful, with the grace of a running horse. He had punted against the wind for eighty yards in the Yale Bowl. He was a handsome fellow, soft-spoken and kindly, with the fearless gentleness of the athlete.",1
1908,He can't take a joke. He takes things too seriously. They left him.,1
1910,"He lost count of the hours--he had no sense of time--no regular periods for sleep, work, or recreation, although he attended his classes faithfully, and ate with fair regularity by compulsion of dining-hall or boarding-house schedules. The food was abundant, coarse, greasily and badly cooked. It was very cheap: at the college commons, twelve dollars a month; at the boarding-houses, fifteen. He ate at the commons for a month: his interest in food was too profound and too intelligent to stand it longer. The commons was housed in a large bleak building of white brick. It was called officially Stiggins Hall, but in the more descriptive epithet of the students--The Sty.",1
1911,"He went to see Helen and Hugh Barton several times. They lived thirty-five miles away at Sydney, the State capital. It was a town of thirty thousand people, sleepy, with quiet leafy pavements, and a capitol Square in the centre, with radial streets. At the head of the main street, across from the capitol, a brown weathered building of lichened stone, was a cheap hotel--the largest and most notorious brothel in town. There were also three denominational colleges for young women.",1
1919,But he wanted to get in. He wanted to be urbane and careless. He wanted to wear well-cut clothes. He wanted to be a gentleman. He wanted to go to war.,1
1921,"So long, boys! See you in Berlin. The shining and dividing sea was closer and not so wide.",1
1923,"He liked all weird fable and wild invention, in prose or verse, from the Golden Ass to Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the chief prince of the moon and magic. But he liked the fabulous wherever he found it, and for whatever purpose. The best fabulists have often been the greatest satirists: satire (as with Aristophanes, Voltaire, and Swift) is a high and subtle art, quite beyond the barnyard snipings and wholesale geese- slaughterings of the present degenerate age. Great satire needs the sustenance of great fable. Swift's power of invention is incomparable: there's no better fabulist in the world.",1
1924,"He read Poe's stories, Frankenstein, and the plays of Lord Dunsany. He read Sir Gawayne and the Greene Knight and the Book of Tobit. He did not want his ghosts and marvels explained. Magic was magic. He wanted old ghosts--not Indian ghosts, but ghosts in armor, the spirit of old kings, and pillioned ladies with high coned hats. Then, for the first time, he thought of the lonely earth he dwelt on. Suddenly, it was strange to him that he should read Euripides there in the wilderness.",1
1926,"I am thy father's spirit,       Doomed for a certain term to walk the night       Between Bloomington and Portland, Maine. He felt suddenly the devastating impermanence of the nation. Only the earth endured--the gigantic American earth, bearing upon its awful breast a world of flimsy rickets. Only the earth endured-- this broad terrific earth that had no ghosts to haunt it. Stogged in the desert, half-broken and overthrown, among the columns of lost temples strewn, there was no ruined image of Menkaura, there was no alabaster head of Akhnaton. Nothing had been done in stone. Only this earth endured, upon whose lonely breast he read Euripides. Within its hills he had been held a prisoner; upon its plain he walked, alone, a stranger.",1
1928,"Eliza visited Helen in Sydney in the Spring. The girl was quieter, sadder, more thoughtful than she had ever been. She was subdued by the new life: chastened by her obscurity. She missed Gant more than she would confess. She missed the mountain town.",1
1932,"There's no use doing it all for the other fellow. Say, child! she exclaimed, ""why wouldn't it be a good idea if he tried to get the Altamont agency? I don't believe that fellow they've got is much account. He could get it without trying. There was a pause.",1
1934,"If he works hard there's no reason why he shouldn't build a good business up. Your papa's been complaining here lately about his trouble. He'd be glad to have you back. She shook her head slowly for a moment. Child! they didn't do him a bit of good, up there. It's all come back. They drove over to Pulpit Hill at Easter for a two days' visit.",1
1935,"Eliza took him to Exeter and bought him a suit of clothes. I don't like those skimpy trousers,"" she told the salesman. I want something that makes him look more of a man. When he was newly dressed, she puckered her lips, smiling, and said:  ""Spruce up, boy!  Throw your shoulders back!",1
1937,"You're a good smart-looking fellow,"" said Eliza smiling, ""I'll make a trade with you. If you drum up some boarders for me among your friends here in this part of the State, I'll throw in your board free. Here are some of my cards,"" she added, opening her purse. You might hand a few of them out, if you get a chance, and say a good word for Dixieland in the Land of the Sky.""  ""Yes, ma'am,"" said Mr. Ballantyne, in a slow surprised voice, ""I certainly will.",1
1942,"Eugene was sixteen years old. He was a College Man. He walked among the gay crowd of afternoon with a sense of elation, answering the hearty greetings with joy, warming to its thoughtless bombast.",1
1943,"They tell me you're batting a thousand down there, son,"" yelled Mr. Wood, the plump young pharmacist, who had been told nothing at all. That's right, boy! Go get 'em. The man passed forward cheerfully, up the prosperous glade of his store. Fans droned.",1
1944,"After all, Eugene thought, he had not done so badly. He had felt his first wounds. He had not been broken. He had seen love's bitter mystery. He had lived alone.",1
1947,"She was the only young person at Dixieland. Eugene spoke to her with timid hauteur. He thought her plain and dull. But he began to sit with her on the porch at night. Somehow, he began to love her.",1
1950,"Eugene sat on the porch rail one evening and talked to her. Before, he had only nodded, or spoken stiffly a word or two. They began haltingly, aware painfully of gaps in their conversation.",1
1951,"You're from Little Richmond, aren't you?"" he said. Yes,"" said Laura James, ""do you know any one from there? Yes,"" said he, ""I know John Bynum and a boy named Ficklen.",1
1958,"He was displeased. She looks all right,"" he said. She's not as ugly as you make out.",1
1960,"He tried to live before her in armor. He showed off before her. Perhaps, he thought, if he were splendid enough, she would not see the ugly disorder and meanness of the world he dwelt in.",1
1966,"Why no-o, child. I can't now. Who's that with you? she cried, obviously flustered. She opened the door. Huh?  Heh?  Have you seen 'Gene? Is it 'Gene?""  ""Yes,"" he said.",1
1968,"Why, son, what in the world! I don't know. You'll have to do something,"" she whispered, twisting her hands together.",1
1976,"Take him in here, boy. Take him in here,"" she whispered, motioning to a large bed-room on the upper side of the house. Eugene propelled his father through a blind passage of bath room, and pushed him over on the creaking width of an iron bed.",1
1978,"Gant roared. Mountain Grills--all of them, fattening upon my heart's-blood. They have done me to death, as sure as there's a God in heaven. Eliza appeared in the door, her face contorted by weeping.",1
1987,"I say, is it a cancer?""  ""Hush! she cried. No.  Of course not!  Don't be foolish. He fell back exhausted, with eyes closed.",1
1990,"A very quiet despair was in his heart, a weary peace that brooded too upon the house of death and tumult, that flowed, like a soft exploring wind, through its dark halls, bathing all things quietly with peace and weariness. The boarders had fled like silly sheep to the two houses across the street: they had eaten there, they were clustered there upon the porches, whispering. And their going brought him peace and freedom, as if his limbs had been freed from a shackling weight. Eliza, amid the slow smoke of the kitchen, wept more quietly over the waste of supper; he saw the black mournful calm of the negress's face. He walked slowly up the dark hall, with a handkerchief tied loosely round his wound. He felt suddenly the peace that comes with despair. The sword that pierces very deep had fared through the folds of his poor armor of pride. The steel had sheared his side, had bitten to his heart. But under his armor he had found himself. No more than himself could be known. No more than himself could be given. What he was--he was: evasion and pretense could not add to his sum. With all his heart he was glad.",1
1994,"she asked. He leaned against the wall limply, drained of his strength at her touch. Eugene. My dear,"" she said. She pulled his drooping face down to her lips and kissed him. My sweet, my darling, don't look like that. All his resistance melted from him.",1
1996,"He held between his hands her elegant small head, so gloriously wound with its thick bracelet of fine blonde hair, and spoke the words he had never spoken--the words of confession, filled with love and humility. Don't go! Don't go! Please don't go! he begged. Don't leave, dear. Please!""  ""Hush!",1
2000,"Let me see! O-ho, you've got a nurse now, haven't you? she said, with a good laugh.",1
2002,"Oh, it's all right now, mama. It's been fixed,"" he said wearily, reflecting that she had the very thing always too late. He looked at Helen grinning:  ""God bless our Happy Home!",1
2004,"I feel like one of the family now anyhow. He needn't think he can carry on like this,"" said Eliza resentfully. I'm not going to put up with it any longer. Oh forget about it!"" said Helen wearily.",1
2006,I don't believe there's a thing in the world wrong with him but that vile licker. All his trouble comes from that. Oh--how ridiculous!,1
2020,"In the darkness he caught at his throat. Yes,"" he said. The moon quartered gently across heaven. Eliza came out again, timidly, hesitantly.",1
2021,"Who's there? Who's there? she spoke into the darkness. Where's 'Gene? Oh!  I didn't know! Are you there, son? She knew very well.",1
2023,"It's a fine night, isn't it? As the fellow says, a night for lovers. She laughed uncertainly, then stood for a moment in thought.",1
2031,"He struggled in a chaos of confused fury, trying for silence. At last he spoke in a low voice, filled with his passion:  ""We've got to have something, mama. We've got to have something, you know. We can't go on always alone--alone. It was dark.",1
2033,"I know! Eliza agreed hastily. I'm not saying--""  ""My God, my God, where are we going?",1
2037,"I've done the best I could! she said. I'd have given you a home if I could. I'd have put up with anything after Grover's death, but he never gave me a moment's peace. Nobody knows what I've been through. Nobody knows, child. Nobody knows. He saw her face in the moonlight, contorted by an ugly grimace of sorrow.",1
2041,"Ah, he thought, as his heart twisted in him full of wild pain and regret, she will be dead some day and I shall always remember this. Always this. This.",1
2043,"Presently, returning to an abrupt reflective pause, she said: ""Well, I may do it. I want a place where my children can come to see me and bring their friends, when they come home. Yes,"" he said, ""yes.",1
2046,"You ought to. Well, good- night. They kissed with a love, for the time, washed clean of bitterness. Eliza went before him into the dark house.",1
2052,"You see, don't you? she smiled triumphantly. And right there is where I shall build. That lot will bring twice its present value in five years. Yes,"" he said, kissing her.",1
2054,"He went out and began to mount the dark stairs. Benjamin Gant, entering at this moment, stumbled across a mission-chair in the hall. He cursed fiercely, and struck at the chair with his hand. Damn it! Oh damn it! Mrs. Pert whispered a warning behind him, with a fuzzy laugh. Eugene paused, then mounted softly the carpeted stair, so that he would not be heard, entering the sleeping-porch at the top of the landing on which he slept.",1
2065,"Good-morning,"" he said, ""how do you feel?""  His father cast his uneasy flickering eyes on him, and groaned. Merciful God! I'm being punished for my sins. You'll feel better in a little,"" said Eugene.",1
2067,"Oh, it's all right,"" said Eugene quickly. Who told you about my hand?""  ""She said I had hurt your hand,"" said Gant sorrowfully. Ah-h!"" said the boy angrily. No.  I wasn't hurt. Gant leaned to the side and, without looking, clumsily, patted his son's uninjured hand.",1
2071,"You do this every day, don't you?""  ""Daddy gets after me about it,"" she admitted, ""but I love to buy clothes. I spend all my money on clothes. What are you going to do now?""  ""Nothing--whatever you like.",1
2072,"It's a lovely day to do something, isn't it?""  ""It's a lovely day to do nothing. Would you like to go off somewhere, Laura?""  ""I'd love to go off somewhere with you,"" said Laura James. That is the idea, my girl. That is the idea,"" he said exultantly, in throaty and exuberant burlesque. We will go off somewhere alone--we will take along something to eat,"" he said lusciously.",1
2074,"What do you want that for? she said suspiciously. I'm going to the bank,"" he said ironically. I wanted something to carry my money in. But immediately he added roughly:  ""I'm going on a picnic.",1
2076,"We're going to have lemonade--I've promised to bring the lemons. I'll vow, boy!"" said Eliza fretfully. I don't like it--your running off this way when I need you. I wanted you to make a deposit for me, and the telephone people will disconnect me if I don't send them the money to-day. O mama!",1
2080,"On their way up the hill, they stopped for a few minutes at Gant's. They found Helen and Ben in the dining-room. Ben was eating breakfast, bending, as usual, with scowling attention, over his coffee, turning from eggs and bacon almost with disgust. Helen insisted on contributing boiled eggs and sandwiches to their provision: the two women went back into the kitchen. Eugene sat at table with Ben, drinking coffee.",1
2094,"This is the time you need it--not later,"" said Ben.  ""Make him put you through college. This is an age of specialization. They're looking for college-trained men. Yes,"" said Eugene.",1
2103,"Eugene made no answer. You can't do that and be anything, you know. And you're likely to catch everything. This looks like a nice girl,"" he said quietly, after a pause. For heaven's sake, fix yourself up and try to keep fairly clean. Women notice that, you know. Look at your fingernails, and keep your clothes pressed. Have you any money?""  ""All I need,"" said Eugene, looking nervously toward the kitchen.",1
2104,"Don't, for God's sake!""  ""Put it in your pocket, you little fool,"" Ben said angrily, thrusting a bill into his hand. You've got to have some money. Keep it until you need it. Helen came out on the high front porch with them as they departed.",1
2105,"As usual, she had added a double heaping measure to what they needed. There was another shoe-box stuffed with sandwiches, boiled eggs, and fudge. She stood on the high step-edge, with a cloth wound over her head, her gaunt arms, pitted with old scars, akimbo. A warm sunny odor of nasturtiums, loamy earth, and honeysuckle washed round them its hot spermy waves.",1
2110,"But the hills were lordly, with a plan. Westward, they widened into the sun, soaring up from buttressing shoulders. The town was thrown up on the plateau like an encampment: there was nothing below him that could resist time. There was no idea. Below him, in a cup, he felt that all life was held: he saw it as might one of the old schoolmen writing in monkish Latin a Theatre of Human Life; or like Peter Breughel, in one of his swarming pictures. It seemed to him suddenly that he had not come up on the hill from the town, but that he had come out of the wilderness like a beast, and was staring now with steady beast-eye at this little huddle of wood and mortar which the wilderness must one day repossess, devour, cover over.",1
2113,"The boy grew blind with love and desire: the cup of his heart was glutted with all this wonder. It overcame and weakened him. He grasped the girl's cool fingers. They stood leg to leg, riven into each other's flesh. Then they left the road, cutting down across its loops along steep wooded paths. The wood was a vast green church; the bird-cries fell like plums. A great butterfly, with wings of blue velvet streaked with gold and scarlet markings, fluttered heavily before them in freckled sunlight, tottering to rest finally upon a spray of dogwood. There were light skimming noises in the dense undergrowth to either side, the swift bullet- shadows of birds. A garter snake, greener than wet moss, as long as a shoelace and no thicker than a woman's little finger, shot across the path, its tiny eyes bright with terror, its small forked tongue playing from its mouth like an electric spark. Laura cried out, drawing back in sharp terror; at her cry he snatched up a stone in a wild lust to kill the tiny creature that shot at them, through its coils, the old snake-fear, touching them with beauty, with horror, with something supernatural. But the snake glided away into the undergrowth and, with a feeling of strong shame, he threw the stone away. They won't hurt you,"" he said.",1
2117,"Laura and Eugene lay upon their backs, looking up through the high green shimmer of leaves at the Caribbean sky, with all its fleet of cloudy ships. The water of the brook made a noise like silence. The town behind the hill lay in another unthinkable world. They forgot its pain and conflict.",1
2127,"When I'm twenty-six, you'll be thirty-one. When I'm forty-eight, you'll be fifty-three. What's that? he said contemptuously. Nothing.""  ""Everything,"" she said, ""everything.",1
2129,"he yelled furiously. I'm going to be a lawyer. That's what they're sending me for. I'm going to be a lawyer, and I'm going into politics. Perhaps,"" he added with gloomy pleasure, ""you'll be sorry then, after I make a name for myself. With bitter joy he foresaw his lonely celebrity. The Governor's Mansion. Forty rooms. Alone. Alone.",1
2138,It's what you'll always want. You couldn't stand anything else. You'd get so tired of me. You'll forget this ever happened. You'll forget me. You'll forget-- forget. Forget!,1
2145,The summer's only started. You will burn up down there. Yes.,1
2146,"It's silly, I know. But my people expect me for the Fourth of July. You know, we have an enormous family--hundred of aunts, cousins, and in-laws. We have a family re-union every year--a great barbecue and picnic. I hate it. But they'd never forgive me if I didn't come. Frightened, he looked at her for a moment.",1
2157,"Come back again! But he knew. Her cry followed him, as if he had torn something from her grasp.",1
2159,"He read her prosy letter with rigid face, devouring the words more hungrily than if they had been lyrical song. She would come back! She would come back! Soon.",1
2161,"Richard came yesterday. He is twenty-five, works in Norfolk. I've been engaged to him almost a year. We're going off quietly to Norfolk to-morrow and get married. My dear! My dear! I couldn't tell you! I tried to, but couldn't. I didn't want to lie. Everything else was true. I meant all I said. If you hadn't been so young, but what's the use of saying that?  Try to forgive me, but please don't forget me. Good-by and God bless you. Oh, my darling, it was heaven! I shall never forget you. When he had finished the letter, he re-read it, slowly and carefully.",1
2165,"She puckered her lips in playful reproach. Oh, for God's sake,"" he muttered angrily. What fellow says! His scowl broke into an angry grin as he caught his sister's eye.",1
2169,"I wouldn't let on to her that it affected me. I'd write her just as big as you please and laugh about the whole thing. I'd show them! That's what I'd--""  ""Oh, for God's sake!",1
2170,"he groaned, starting up. Leave me alone, won't you?""  He left the house. But he wrote the letter. And the moment after the lid of the mailbox clanged over it, he was writhen by shame. For it was a proud and boastful letter, salted with scatterings of Greek, Latin, and English verse, quotable scraps, wrenched into the text without propriety, without accuracy, without anything but his pitiful and obvious desire to show her his weight in the point of his wit, the depth of his learning. She would be sorry when she knew her loss! But, for a moment at the end, his fiercely beating heart stormed through:  "". . .",1
2171,"and I hope he's worth having you--he can't deserve you, Laura; no one can. But if he knows what he has, that's something. How lucky he is! You're right about me--I'm too young. I'd cut off my hand now for eight or ten years more. God bless and keep you, my dear, dear Laura.",1
2172,"Something in me wants to burst. It keeps trying to, but it won't, it never has. O God! If it only would!  I shall never forget you. I'm lost now and I'll never find the way again. In God's name write me a line when you get this. Tell me what your name is now-- you never have. Tell me where you're going to live. Don't let me go entirely, I beg of you, don't leave me alone. He sent the letter to the address she had given him--to her father's house.",1
2174,"Upon the darkening porch, awaiting food, the boarders rocked, oh rocked with laughter. The boarders said:  ""Eugene's lost his girl. He doesn't know what to do, he's lost his girl. Well, well!  Did the Old Boy lose his girl?""  The little fat girl, the daughter of one of the two fat sisters whose husbands were hotel clerks in Charleston, skipped to and from him, in slow May dance, with fat calves twinkling brownly above her socks.",1
2181,"He'll git over it,"" said Jake Clapp, in a precise country drawl, streaked with a note of bawdry. Every boy has got to go through the Calf-Love stage. When I was about 'Gene's age--""  He pressed his hard thigh gently against Florry, grinning widely and thinly with a few gold teeth. He was a tall solid man, with a hard precise face, lewdly decorous, and slanting Mongol eyes. His head was bald and knobby.",1
2184,"Where are you going, 'Gene? she said quietly. Her eyes of light violet were a little tired. There was a faint exquisite perfume of rosewater.",1
2185,"Leave me alone! he muttered. You can't go on like this,"" she said in a low tone. She's not worth it--none of them are. Pull yourself together. Leave me alone!",1
2190,"I will make you fall down on all the people in you, House,"" he said. Fool!"" cried Ben, leaping upon him, ""what are you trying to do?"" He caught the boy's arms from behind and dragged him back. Do you think you can bring her back to you by wrecking the house? Are there no other women in the world, that you should let one get the best of you like this?""  ""Let me go!",1
2191,"Let me go!"" said Eugene. What does it matter to you?""  ""Don't think, fool, that I care,"" said Ben fiercely. You're hurting no one but yourself. Do you think you'll hurt the boarders by pulling the house down on your own head? Do you think, idiot, that any one cares if you kill yourself? He shook the boy. No. No.  I don't care what you do, you know. I simply want to save the family the trouble and expense of burying you. With a great cry of rage and bafflement Eugene tried to free himself.",1
2192,"But the older brother held on as desperately as the Old Man of the Sea. Then, with a great effort of his hands and shoulders, the boy lifted his captor off the ground, and dashed him back against the white brick wall of the cellar. Ben collapsed, releasing him, with a fit of dry coughing, holding his hand against his thin breast.",1
2194,"Are you all right now?""  ""Yes--don't talk about it, please.""  ""I don't want to talk about it, fool. I want you to learn a little sense,"" said Ben. He straightened, brushing his whitened coat. In a moment, he went on quietly:  ""To hell with them, 'Gene. To hell with them all. Don't let them worry you. Get all that you can. Don't give a damn for anything. Nothing gives a damn for you. To hell with it all! To hell with it! There are a lot of bad days. There are a lot of good ones. You'll forget. There are a lot of days. Let it go. Yes,"" said Eugene wearily, ""let it go.",1
2201,"It's turned off cool,"" she said. That little bit of rain has done a lot of good, hasn't it?""  ""Yes, it was hot,"" he said. I hate hot weather. I can't stand it either,"" she said.",1
2203,I knew it was somewhere out there. Is it a big place? he asked curiously.,1
2205,"He reflected with greedy satisfaction. Is it pretty? Are there a lot of pretty houses and fine buildings?""  ""Yes--I think so,"" she said reflectively.",1
2206,It's a nice homelike place. What are the people like? What do they do? Are they rich? Why--yes.,1
2207,"It's a business and manufacturing place. There are a lot of rich people. I suppose they live in big houses and ride around in big cars, eh?"" he demanded.",1
2209,"he muttered lusciously. Beer--eh? You make it out there?""  ""Yes.",1
2210,"She laughed, with a voluptuous note in her voice. I believe you're a bad boy, Eugene. And what about the theatres and libraries?",1
2212,"We have a nice library. How many books has it?""  ""Oh, I can't say as to that. But it's a good big library. Over 100,000 books, do you suppose?",1
2218,"I believe I will,"" she whispered. Have you got a cigarette? He gave her his package; she stood up to receive the flame he nursed in his cupped hands.",1
2219,"She leaned her heavy body against him as, with puckered face and closed eyes, she held her cigarette to the fire. She grasped his shaking hands to steady the light, holding them for a moment after. What,"" said ""Miss Brown,"" with a cunning smile, ""what if your mother should see us? You'd catch it!""  ""She'll not see us,"" he said.",1
2221,"But he grinned in the dark, because the woman had revealed herself with a cigarette. It was a sign--the sign of the province, the sign unmistakable of debauchery.",1
2223,"Where is your room?"" he said. She told him. Later, Eliza came suddenly and silently out upon them, on one of her swift raids from the kitchen.",1
2224,"Who's there? Who's there? she said, peering into the gloom suspiciously. Huh?  Hah? Where's Eugene? Has any one seen Eugene? She knew very well he was there.",1
2228,"Then hesitantly, by awkward talkative stages, she went into the house again. Son,"" she said before she went, troubled, ""it's getting late. You'd better go to bed. That's where we all ought to be. Miss Brown"" assented gracefully and moved toward the door.",1
2233,"Well, good-night, mama,"" he said, ashamed and hurt. Let's forget about them for a while. What does it matter?""  ""Be a good boy,"" said Eliza timidly.",1
2235,"Through the dark house a shaft of air blew coolly. Slowly, with thudding heart, he began to mount the stairs. But on that dark stair, his foot-falls numbed in the heavy carpet, he came squarely upon a woman's body that, by its fragrance, like magnolia, he knew was that of Mrs. Selborne. They held each other sharply by the arms, discovered, with caught breath. She bent toward him: a few strands of her blonde hair brushed his face, leaving it aflame.",1
2239,"For,"" said she, ""if I wanted money, I wouldn't fool with you. Somebody tries to get me to go out every day. One of the richest men in this town (old man Tyson) has been after me ever since I came. He's offered me ten dollars if I'll go out in his car with him. I don't need your money. But you've got to give me something. I don't care how little it is. I wouldn't feel decent unless you did. I'm not one of your little Society Chippies that you see every day uptown. I've too much self-respect for that.",1
2240,"So, in lieu of money, he gave her his medals as pledges. If you don't redeem them,"" said ""Miss Brown,"" ""I'll give them to my own son when I go home. Have you a son?""  ""Yes.",1
2241,"He's eighteen years old. He's almost as tall as you are and twice as broad. All the girls are mad about him. He turned his head away sharply, whitening with a sense of nausea and horror, feeling in him an incestuous pollution.",1
2245,"Sometimes she coughed gently, smiling, holding a small crumpled handkerchief, edged with blue, before her mouth. She had come to the hills not because of her own health, but because of her mother's, a woman of sixty-five, rustily dressed, with the petulant hang-dog face of age and sickness. The old woman suffered from asthma and heart-disease. They had come from Florida. Irene Mallard was a very capable business woman; she was the chief bookkeeper of one of the Altamont banks. Every evening Randolph Gudger, the bank president, telephoned her.",1
2250,"But they danced there slowly in a gray light of dusk that was like pain and beauty; like the lost light undersea, in which his life, a lost merman, swam, remembering exile. And as they danced she, whom he dared not touch, yielded her body unto him, whispering softly to his ear, pressing with slender fingers his hot hand. And she, whom he would not touch, lay there, like a sheaf of grain, in the crook of his arm, token of the world's remedy--the refuge from the one lost face out of all the faces, the anodyne against the wound named Laura--a thousand flitting shapes of beauty to bring him comfort and delight. The great pageantry of pain and pride and death hung through the dusk its awful vision, touching his sorrow with a lonely joy. He had lost; but all pilgrimage across the world was loss: a moment of cleaving, a moment of taking away, the thousand phantom shapes that beaconed, and the high impassionate grief of stars.",1
2255,"All through the waning summer he walked with Irene Mallard. They walked at night through the cool streets filled with the rustle of tired leaves. They went together to the hotel roof and danced; later ""Pap"" Rheinhart, kind and awkward and shy, and smelling of his horse, came to their little table, sitting and drinking with them. He had spent the years since Leonard's at a military school, trying to straighten the wry twist of his neck. But he remained the same as ever--quizzical, dry, and humorous. Eugene looked at that good shy face, remembering the lost years, the lost faces. And there was sorrow in his heart for what would come no more. August ended.",1
2257,"Luke!"" shouted Mr. Fawcett, the land-auctioneer, pulling him in from the street to Wood's pharmacy, ""by God, son, you've done your bit. I'm going to set you up. What are you going to have?""  ""Make it a dope,"" said Luke.",1
2261,"That's my last refuge on earth. Woman, have you no mercy? I beg of you, leave me to die in peace: it won't be long now. You can do what you please with it after I'm gone, but give me a little peace now. In the name of Jesus, I ask it! He sniffled affectedly.",1
2262,"Pshaw!"" said Eliza, thinking no doubt to encourage him. There's nothing wrong with you. Half of it's only imagination. He groaned, turning his head away.",1
2266,"You damned old man!"" cried Helen, seizing and shaking his passive shoulders as he lay reeking and sodden on an untidy bed. I could wear you out! You're not sick; I've wasted my life nursing you, and you're not as sick as I am! You'll be here long after I'm gone, you selfish old man! It makes me furious!""  ""Why, baby!"" he roared, with a vast gesture of his arms, ""God bless you, I couldn't do without you.",1
2267,"Don't 'baby' me! she cried. But she held his hand next day as they rode out to the hospital, held it as, quaking, he turned for an instant and looked sadly at the city stretched behind and below him.",1
2272,"Old 'Gene with a girl! Pity the poor girl! Ah, Lord, Boy! That's a long way off for you. Thank your stars!",1
2275,"The house was almost empty. At night Eliza packed his trunk carefully, counting the ironed shirts and mended socks with satisfaction. Now, you have plenty of good warm clothes, son. Try to take care of them. She put Gant's check in his inner pocket and fastened it with a safety-pin.",1
2278,"Don't think, mama, that you can work on my feelings here at the last minute,"" he cried, already deeply worked-on. It's easy to cry. But I was here all the time if you had had time for me. Oh, for God's sake! Let's make an end to this! Aren't things bad enough without it? Why must you act this way whenever I go off? Do you want to make me as miserable as you can?""  ""Well, I tell you,"" said Eliza hopefully, becoming dry-eyed at once, ""if I make a couple of deals and everything goes well, you may find me waiting for you in a big fine house when you come back next Spring.",1
2289,"Good God!"" cried Eugene. Do you hear it?"" said Bob Sterling, beginning to laugh. Then he went into the room, chafing his dry hands briskly.",1
2292,Two weeks later the widow returned to gather together the boy's belongings. Silently she collected the clothing that no one would ever wear. She was a stout woman in her forties. Eugene took all the pennants from the wall and folded them. She packed them in a valise and turned to go.,1
2293,"Here's another,"" said Eugene. She burst suddenly into tears and seized his hand. He was so brave,"" she said, ""so brave. Those last days--I had not meant to--Your letters made him so happy. She's alone now, Eugene thought.",1
2294,"I cannot stay here, he thought, where he has been. We were here together. Always I should see him on the landing, with the hissing valve and the blue lips, or hear him mumbling his lessons. Then, at night, the other cot would be empty. I think I shall room alone hereafter.",1
2303,"Thus, she had brought him home, the shadow of his death suspended over them like a Damocles sword. Fear prowled softly through their brains on leopard feet. The girl lived in a condition of repressed hysteria: it had its outburst daily at Eliza's or in her own home. Hugh Barton had purchased a house to which he had taken her.",1
2309,"Yes, that's right, that's right! Calm yourself. You are Napoleon Bonaparte and I'm your old friend, Oliver Cromwell. Harold! he called. Help! He killed the keeper and got out. 'Gene!",1
2315,"It was necessary to speak to every one. If one spoke to every one, one was ""democratic""; if one did not, one was a snob, and got few votes. The appraisal of personality, like all other appraisal with them, was coarse and blunt. They were suspicious of all eminence. They had a hard peasant hostility to the unusual. A man was brilliant? Was there a bright sparkle to him? Bad, bad! He was not safe; he was not sound. The place was a democratic microcosmos--seething with political interests: national, regional, collegiate.",1
2324,"Well!"" said Eliza sorrowfully, as she peered above the stove, ""let's all try to be happy this time and enjoy a quiet Christmas. You never know! She shook her head, unable to continue. Her eyes were wet. It may be the last time we're all together. The old trouble! The old trouble! she said hoarsely, turning to him.",1
2326,"Oh, my God!"" he groaned. You'll be here when the rest of us are rotten. Helen burst into a raucous angry laugh, looking at his sullen face, and prodding him roughly with her big fingers.",1
2329,"the girl cried irritably. There's nothing wrong with you. You're not the sick one! Papa's the sick one. He's the one that needs attention. Can't you realize that--he's dying. He may not last the winter out. I'm the sick one! You'll be here long after we're both gone. You never know,"" said Eliza mysteriously.",1
2336,"How have you been, son?"" he asked. Are you getting along all right?""  ""Yes.  I am a reporter on the paper now; I may be managing editor next year. I have been elected to several organizations,"" he went on eagerly, glad of the rare chance to speak to one of them about his life. But when he looked up again, his father's stare was fixed sadly in the fire. The boy stopped in confusion, pierced with a bitter pain.",1
2338,"He had left the town early in the autumn, after his return from Baltimore. For three months he had wandered alone through the South, selling to the merchants in small towns space for advertisements upon laundry cards. How well this curious business succeeded he did not say: he was scrupulously neat, but threadbare and haggard, and more fiercely secretive than ever. He had found employment at length upon a newspaper in a rich tobacco town of the Piedmont. He was going there after Christmas.",1
2339,"He had come to them, as always, bearing gifts. Luke came in from the naval school at Newport, on Christmas eve. They heard his sonorous tenor shouting greetings to people in the street; he entered the house upon a blast of air. Everyone began to grin.",1
2341,"How are you?"" said Gant, with a pleased grin. Couldn't be better, Colonel 'Gene, how are you, Old Scout?  Good!"" he said, without waiting for an answer. Well, well, if it isn't Old Baldy,"" he cried, pumping Ben's hand. I didn't know whether you'd be here or not. Mama, old girl,"" he said, as he embraced her, ""how're they going? Still hitting on all six.  Fine! he yelled, before any one could reply to anything.",1
2344,"Eliza screamed. How much did you give?""  ""Oh, only a little six-inch strip,"" he said carelessly. The boy was badly burned: a bunch of us got together and chipped in with a little hide. Mercy!"" said Eliza.",1
2345,"You'll be lame for life. It's a wonder you can walk. He always thinks of others--that boy!"" said Gant proudly.",1
2349,"There! she said cheerfully. That's not going to hurt him. Son,"" said Eliza gravely, balancing her wine-glass, ""I don't want you ever to acquire a taste for it.",1
2365,"Let's take off his shoes,"" said Julius Arthur. They unlaced them and pulled them off. Is there anything else you want, son?"" said Julius.",1
2375,"Hah?  Huh? What is it?"" said Eliza. But she knew, of course, instantly, what it was.",1
2379,"Well, you see! Helen began, kindly enough, but with a brooding satisfaction. It only goes to show we're all alike. We all like it. It's in our blood. That awful curse!",1
2380,"Eliza said. I had hoped that I might have one son who might escape it. It seems,"" she said, bursting into tears, ""as if a Judgment were on us. The sins of the fathers--""  ""Oh! for heaven's sake!",1
2387,"During the morning his father asked him to come for a walk. Gant was embarrassed and hang-dog; a duty of gentle admonishment devolved upon him--he had been counselled to it by Helen and Eliza. Now, no man in his time could carry on in the big, Bow-wow style better than Gant, but none was less fitted to scatter the blossoms of sweetness and light. His wrath was sudden, his invective sprang from the moment, but he had for this occasion no thunder-bolts in his quiver, and no relish for the business before him. He had a feeling of personal guilt; he felt like a magistrate fining for intoxication a culprit with whom he has been on a spree the night before. Besides--what if the Bacchic strain in him had been passed on to his son?  They walked on in silence across the Square, by the rimmed fountain.",1
2392,"Why don't you speak to her? she said irritably. She may listen to you--she won't to me! Tell her so! You've seen how she's rubbed it in to poor old papa, haven't you? Do you think that old man--sick as he is--is to blame? 'Gene's not a Gant, anyway. He takes after her side of the house. He's queer--like all of them! WE'RE Gants! she said with a bitter emphasis.",1
2393,"There was always some excuse for papa,"" said the sailor. He's had a lot to put up with. All his convictions in family affairs had been previously signed with her approval.",1
2395,"The boy was doing a multiple penance--he had committed his first great wrong in being at once so remote from them and so near to them. His present trouble was aggravated by the cross-complication of Eliza's thrusts at his father, and the latent but constantly awakening antagonism of mother and daughter. In addition, he bore directly Eliza's nagging and carping attack. All this he was prepared for--it was the weather of his mother's nature (she was as fond of him as of any of them, he thought), and the hostility of Helen and Luke was something implacable, unconscious, fundamental, that grew out of the structure of their lives. He was of them, he was recognizably marked, but he was not with them, nor like them. He had been baffled for years by the passionate enigma of their dislike--their tenders of warmth and affection, when they came, were strange to him: he accepted them gratefully and with a surprise he did not wholly conceal. Otherwise, he had grown into a shell of sullenness and quiet: he spoke little in the house.",1
2397,"The outbreak came three nights before his departure as he stood, tense and stolid, in the parlor. For almost an hour, in a savage monotone, Ben had tried deliberately, it seemed, to goad him to an attack. He had listened without a word, smothering in pain and fury, and enraging by his silence the older brother who was finding a vent for his own alien frustration.",1
2402,"He bore him backward to the floor as if he were a child, laying him down gently and kneeling above him, because he had been instantly shocked by the fragility of his opponent and the ease of his advantage. He struggled with such mixed rage and shame as those who try quietly to endure the tantrum of a trying brat. As he knelt above Ben, holding his arms pinned, Luke fell heavily on his back, uttering excited cries, strangling him with one arm and cuffing awkwardly with the other.",1
2409,"Ben muttered, turning away nervously. You're crazy. I don't know what you're talking about! He lighted a cigarette, holding the match in a hand that trembled.",1
2414,"As to telling you about myself, what do you want to know?""  ""Well,"" said Eugene slowly, ""you're six years older than I am: you've been away to school, you've worked in big cities, and you are now enlisted in the United States Navy. Why do you always act like God Almighty,"" he continued with rankling bitterness. I know what sailors do! You're no better than I am! What about liquor? What about women?""  ""That's no way to talk before your mother,"" said Luke sternly.",1
2418,"We've done all we could for you. What crime have we accused you of?""  ""Of breathing your air, of eating your food, of living under your roof, of having your life and your blood in my veins, of accepting your sacrifice and privation, and of being ungrateful for it all. We should all be thankful for what we have,"" said Luke  sententiously.",1
2425,"I'm sure there is! cried Eugene. Because I have been punished. By God, I shall spend the rest of my life getting my heart back, healing and forgetting every scar you put upon me when I was a child. The first move I ever made, after the cradle, was to crawl for the door, and every move I have made since has been an effort to escape. And now at last I am free from you all, although you may hold me for a few years more. If I am not free, I am at least locked up in my own prison, but I shall get me some beauty, I shall get me some order out of this jungle of my life: I shall find my way out of it yet, though it take me twenty years more--alone. Alone?"" said Eliza, with the old suspicion.",1
2428,"He gave benediction to the words in which he had so happily defined his position as wage-earner. They stated and confirmed an attitude, and in some measure protected him against the constant betrayals of sentiment. During the Spring he worked stupendously at joining activities, knowing that here was coin whose ring they could hear. He wrote conscientiously each item of his distinctions; his name found its way back more than once to the indulgent Altamont papers. Gant kept the clippings proudly, and gave public readings when he could.",1
2429,"The boy had two short awkward letters from Ben, who was now stationed one hundred miles away, in the tobacco town. At Easter, Eugene visited him, staying at his lodgings, where again his unerring destiny had thrown him into the welcoming arms of a gray- haired widow. She was under fifty--a handsome silly woman, who prodded and teased him as she would an adored child. She addressed him--with a loose giggle--as ""Old Curly-Head,"" at which he fetched out his usual disgusted plea to his Maker. O my God!  Listen to this! She had reverted to an astonishing romping girlhood, and would exercise her playfulness by leaping suddenly upon Old Curly- Head, dealing him a stiff dig in the ribs, and skipping away with a triumphant ""Hah! Got you that time! There was forever in that town a smell of raw tobacco, biting the nostrils with its acrid pungency: it smote the stranger coming from the train, but all the people in the town denied it, saying:  ""No; there is no smell at all.",1
2434,"Ben prowled along, greeting the merchants with a grave scowl, leaning his skull against their round skulls of practicality, across their counters--a phantom soliciting advertisement in a quiet monotone. This is my kid brother, Mr. Fulton. Hello, son!",1
2437,"You see, they think well of you, once you get away from your people. You'll never have a chance at home, 'Gene. They'll ruin everything for you. For heaven's sake, get away when you can.-- What's the matter with you? Why are you looking at me like that? he said sharply, alarmed at the set stare of the boy's face. In a moment he said:  ""They'll spoil your life. Can't you forget about her?""  ""No,"" said Eugene.",1
2444,"The counterman yawned and turned the crackling pages of a morning paper. That was strange. Cars clanked by, beginning to work through the town. Merchants lowered their awnings; he left them as their day began.",1
2446,"The train drew under the boat-shed at Newport News. The terrific locomotive, as beautiful as any ship, breathed with unlaborious fatigue at the rail-head. There, by lapping water, she came to rest, like a completed destiny.",1
2447,"The little boat lay waiting at the dock. Within a few minutes he had left the hot murky smell of the shed and was cruising out into the blue water of the Roads. A great light wind swept over the water, making a singing noise through the tackle of the little boat, making a music and a glory in his heart. He drove along the little decks at a bounding stride, lunging past the staring people, with wild noises in his throat. The lean destroyers, the bright mad camouflage of the freighters and the transports, the lazy red whirl of a propeller, half-submerged, and the light winey sparkle of the waves fused to a single radiance and filled him with glory. He cried back into the throat of the enormous wind, and his eyes were wet.",1
2459,"He was obsessed with the notion that he would find her in the crowd, upon the street, around the corner. He would not speak to her if he met her. He would go proudly and indifferently by. He would not see her. She would see him. She would see him at some heroic moment, just as he was receiving the love and respect of beautiful women. She would speak to him; he would not speak to her. She would be stricken; she would be beaten down; she would cry to him for love and mercy.",1
2462,He was foul and dirty. The soles of his shoes wore through: his calloused feet beat against hot pavements. He stank.,1
2463,"At length, he tried to get work. Work there was in great abundance--but the princely wages of which he had been told were hard to find. He could not swear he was a carpenter, a mason. He was a dirty boy, and looked it. He was afraid. He went to the Navy Yard at Portsmouth, the Naval Base at Norfolk, the Bush Terminal--everywhere there was work, abundant work--hard labor that paid four dollars a day. This he would gladly have taken; but he found that he could not have his wages until after the second week, and that one week's pay would be withheld to tide him over in illness, trouble, or departure.",1
2469,"The superintendent grinned wearily. It's hard work, son,"" the man said. You'll be among the wops and the Swedes and the hunkies. You'll live in the same bunkhouse, you'll eat with them. They don't smell nice, son. I have no money,"" said Eugene.",1
2470,"I'll work hard. I won't get sick. Give me the job. Please!""  ""No,"" said the man.",1
2472,"Thank you. The checker we've got is quitting,"" said the superintendent. You'll go to the stables with him in the morning to get your horse. H-h-h-horse?"" said Eugene.",1
2478,"He came to know them and their overseers--tough reckless men, gray- haired and lustful, full of swift action and coarse humor. Stuck like a jigging doll upon the horse, whom he feared, he rode, staring into heaven, sometimes almost unconscious of the great engine expanding and contracting below him with a brown sensual rhythm. The bird-men filled the blue Virginia weather with the great drone of the Liberties.",1
2480,"The two young men had a few dollars between them. They pooled their resources, and, with wild optimism, purchased from a pawnbroker in Newport News the rudiments of carpenter's equipment-- hammers, saws, and T-squares. They went inland fifteen or twenty miles to a dreary government camp sweltering in the Virginia pines. They were refused employment here and in black dejection returned in the afternoon to the town they had left so hopefully in the morning. Before sundown they had secured employment in the Shipbuilding Yards, but they had been discharged five minutes after they reported for work, when they confessed to a grinning foreman in a room full of woodshavings and quietly slatting belts, that they had no knowledge of the intensely special carpentry of ship's carving. Nor (they might have added) of any other.",1
2483,"Eugene went to work at seven the next morning--Sinker, a day or two later, only when his last small coin had vanished. Eugene screwed up his pride and borrowed a few dollars from one of the other checkers. On this he and Sinker lived meagerly until pay-day-- which was only a few days off. This money slipped quickly through their careless fingers. Down to a few coins again, with the next pay-day almost two weeks off, Sinker gambled at dice with the checkers, behind the great fortress of sacked oats upon the pier-- lost, won, lost, rose penniless and cursing God. Eugene knelt beside the checkers, with his last half-dollar in his palm, heedless of Sinker's bitter taunt. He had never thrown dice before: naturally, he won--$8.50. He rose exultantly from their profane surprise, and took Sinker to dinner at the best hotel.",1
2489,"Eugene went behind the oat pile and climbed blindly up until he reached his little fortress at the top. The world ebbed from his fading sense: all sound grew fainter, more far. Presently, he thought, when I have rested here, I shall get up and go down to work. It has been a hot day. I am tired. But when he tried to move he could not. His will struggled against the imponderable lead of his flesh, stirring helplessly like a man in a cage. He thought quietly, with relief, with tranquil joy. They will not find me here. I cannot move. It is over. If I had thought of this long ago, I would have been afraid. But I'm not, now. Here-- upon this oat pile--doing my bit--for Democracy. I'll begin to stink. They'll find me then.",1
2490,"Life glimmered away out of his weary eyes. He lay, half-conscious, sprawled upon the oats. He thought of the horse.",1
2494,"I--don't--know,"" said Eugene, between bites of cheese. Couldn't. With the checker's loan of five dollars he and Sinker Jordan lived until pay-day.",1
2495,"Then, after dining together on four pounds of steak, Sinker Jordan departed for Altamont and the enjoyment of an inheritance which had fallen due a few days before, on his twenty- first birthday. Eugene stayed on. He was like a man who had died, and had been re-born. All that had gone before lived in a ghostly world. He thought of his family, of Ben, of Laura James, as if they were ghosts. The world itself turned ghost. All through that month of August, while the war marched to its ending, he looked upon its dying carnival. Nothing seemed any longer hard and hot and raw and new. Everything was old. Everything was dying. A vast aerial music, forever far- faint, like the language of his forgotten world, sounded in his ears. He had known birth. He had known pain and love. He had known hunger. Almost he had known death.",1
2500,"And while he stared and saw himself beloved and admitted, he heard them laugh: he felt suddenly the hard white ring of their faces about him, and he plunged away, with cursing mouth. O my sweet bitches! My fine cheap sluts! You little crawling itch of twiddlers: you will snigger at me! At me! At me! (He beat his hands against his ribs.) You will mock at me, with your drug-store pimps, your Jazz-bo apes, your gorilla gobs, you cute little side- porch chippies! What do you understand? The lust of a goat, the stink of your kind--that does for you, my girls. And yet you laugh at me! Ah, but I'll tell you why you laugh: you are afraid of me because I am not like the others. You hate me because I do not belong. You see I am finer and greater than any one you know: you cannot reach me and you hate me. That's it! The ethereal (yet manly) beauty of my features, my boyish charm (for I am Just a Boy) blended with the tragic wisdom of my eyes (as old as life and filled with the brooding tragedy of the ages), the sensitive and delicate flicker of my mouth, and my marvellous dark face blooming inward on strange loveliness like a flower--all this you want to kill because you cannot touch it. Ah me! (Thinking of his strange beauty, his eyes grew moist with love and glory, and he was forced to blow his nose.) Ah, but She will know. The love of a lady. Proudly, with misty eyes, he saw her standing beside him against the rabble: her elegant small head, wound with a bracelet of bright hair, against his shoulder, and with two splendid pearls in her ears. Dearest! Dearest! We stand here on a star. We are beyond them now. Behold! They shrink, they fade, they pass--victorious, enduring, marvellous love, my dearest, we remain.",1
2509,"These negroes, he thought, who came from Africa, were sold at the block in Louisiana, and live in Texas, are now on their way to France. Mr. Finch, the chief checker with the ugly slit eyes, approached Eugene with a smile of false warmth. His gray jaws worked.",1
2512,"Why not?"" said Eugene. I don't want the money bad enough. They're loading her with T. N. T. and nitro-glycerin. The niggers play baseball with those cases. If they ever drop one, they'll bring you home in a bucket. It's all in the day's work,"" said Eugene dramatically.",1
2518,"They earned fifty or sixty dollars a week. Once or twice again, in the dying summer, Eugene went to Norfolk. He saw the sailor, but he no longer tried to see Laura. She seemed far and lost.",1
2520,"The boy was a lean column of brown skin and bone. He had lost over thirty pounds during the summer: he was over six foot four and weighed little more than one hundred and thirty pounds. The sailor was shocked at his emaciation, and bullied him with blustering reproof:  ""Why didn't you t-t-tell me where you were, idiot?",1
2521,I'd have sent you money. For G-g-god's sake!  Come on and eat! They ate.,1
2528,"The town and the nation seethed in the yeasty ferment of war. The country was turning into one huge camp. The colleges and universities were being converted into training-camps for officers. Every one was ""doing his bit. It had been a poor season for tourists.",1
2529,"Eugene found Dixieland almost deserted, save for a glum handful of regular or semi-regular guests. Mrs. Pert was there, sweet, gentle, a trifle more fuzzy than usual. Miss Newton, a wrenny and neurotic old maid, with asthma, who had gradually become Eliza's unofficial assistant in the management of the house, was there. Miss Malone, the gaunt drug-eater with the loose gray lips, was there. Fowler, a civil engineer with blond hair and a red face, who came and departed quietly, leaving a sodden stench of corn-whiskey in his wake, was there. Gant, who had now moved definitely from the house on Woodson Street, which he had rented, to a big back room at Eliza's, was there--a little more waxen, a little more petulant, a little feebler than he had been before. And Ben was there.",1
2533,"Who wants to see your lousy little money? Ben yelled furiously. Fool. You come back, looking like a dead man, as if you'd done something to be proud of. What've you done? What've you done except make a monkey of yourself?""  ""I've paid my own way,"" Eugene cried resentfully, stung and wounded.",1
2534,"That's what I've done. Ah-h,"" said Ben, with an ugly sneer, ""you little fool! That's what they've been after! Do you think you've put anything over on them? Do you? Do you think they give a damn whether you die or not, as long as you save them expense? What are you bragging about? Don't brag until you've got something out of them. Propped on his arm, he smoked deeply, in bitter silence, for a moment.",1
2535,"Then more quietly, he continued. No, 'Gene. Get it out of them any way you can. Make them give it to you. Beg it, take it, steal it--only get it somehow. If you don't, they'll let it rot. Get it, and get away from them. Go away and don't come back. To hell with them! he yelled.",1
2541,"he said. The value of a dollar! By God, I know the value of a dollar better than you do. I've had a little something out of mine, at any rate. What have you had out of yours? I'd like to know that. What the hell's good has it ever been to any one? Will you tell me that?"" he yelled.",1
2543,"What's there to be grateful for? You don't think I'm grateful to you or the old man for anything, do you? What have you ever given me? You let me go to hell from the time I was twelve years old. No one has ever given me a damned nickel since then. Look at your kid here. You've let him run around the country like a crazy man. Did you think enough of him this summer to send him a post-card? Did you know where he was? Did you give a damn, as long as there was fifty cents to be made out of your lousy boarders?""  ""Ingratitude!",1
2553,"But I wish they'd wake us up. He was silent, brooding over his thin bare body, bent forward on the bed for a moment. Maybe,"" he said slowly, ""maybe--there's nothing, nobody to wake. To hell with it all!"" said Ben.",1
2557,"And he talked about his problem with the professors. Gravely, earnestly, he wrestled with his soul, mouthing with gusto the inspiring jargon of the crusade. For the present, said the professors, was his Place not Here? Did his Conscience tell him that he Had to go? If it did, they said gravely, they would say nothing more. But had he considered the Larger Issues?  ""Is not,"" said the Acting Dean persuasively, ""is not this your Sector?",1
2560,"cried Eugene passionately. I tell you it's hard. We must endure,"" said the Dean quietly.",1
2563,"During the first days, in the confusion of the new order, Eugene saw a great deal of them. Then, as the cogs of the machine began to grind more smoothly, and the university was converted into a big army post, with its punctual monotony of drilling, eating, studying, inspection, sleeping, he found himself detached, alone, occupying a position of unique and isolated authority. He Carried On. He Held High the Torch. He Did His Bit. He was editor, reporter, censor, factotum of the paper. He wrote the news. He wrote the editorials. He seared them with flaming words. He extolled the crusade. He was possessed of the inspiration for murder.",1
2565,"Later, he prowled up the dreary main street of the town as the lights went up, ate at the Greek's, flirted with a few stray furtive women until the place went dead at ten o'clock, and came back through the dark countryside in a public-service car beside a drunken old walrus who drove like a demon, and whose name was ""Soak"" Young. October began, and a season of small cold rain. The earth was a sodden reek of mud and rotten leaves. The trees dripped wearily and incessantly. His eighteenth birthday came, and he turned again, with a quivering tension, toward the war.",1
2568,"Heston quieted him during the evening with a stiff drink of gin manufactured from alcohol taken from the medical laboratory. Eugene was silent and babbled incoherently by starts: he asked the medical student a hundred questions about the progress and action of the disease. If it were double pneumonia she would have said so. Doesn't it seem that way to you? Hey?"" he demanded feverishly.",1
2575,"How did it happen? Eugene asked. Tell me. He had taken influenza, they told Eugene, from one of Daisy's children.",1
2578,"The d-d-damned old quack,"" Luke stuttered. Never mind! Never mind! Eugene yelled. Why dig it up now? Get on with it!",1
2581,"The sad prophetic story, a brief and terrible summary of the waste, the tardiness, and the ruin of their lives, silenced them for a moment with its inexorable sense of tragedy. They had nothing to say. The powerful car roared up into the chill dead Square. The feeling of unreality grew upon the boy. He sought for his life, for the bright lost years, in this mean cramped huddle of brick and stone. Ben and I, here by the City Hall, the Bank, the grocery-store (he thought). Why here? In Gath or Ispahan. In Corinth or Byzantium. Not here. It is not real.",1
2584,"The three men went softly up the walk and entered the house. There was a faint clatter from the kitchen, and voices. Papa's in here,"" said Luke.",1
2586,"Hello, son,"" said Gant. He kissed the boy with his bristling cropped mustache. His thin lip began to tremble petulantly.",1
2587,"Have you heard about your brother?"" he snuffled. To think that this should be put upon me, old and sick as I am. O Jesus, it's fearful--""  Helen came in from the kitchen.",1
2599,"Then, in the gray shaded light of the room, he descried Bessie Gant, the nurse, and the long yellow skull's-head of Coker, smiling wearily at him, with big stained teeth, over a long chewed cigar. Then, under the terrible light which fell directly and brutally upon the bed alone, he saw Ben. And in that moment of searing recognition he saw, what they had all seen, that Ben was dying.",1
2600,"Ben's long thin body lay three-quarters covered by the bedding; its gaunt outline was bitterly twisted below the covers, in an attitude of struggle and torture. It seemed not to belong to him, it was somehow distorted and detached as if it belonged to a beheaded criminal. And the sallow yellow of his face had turned gray; out of this granite tint of death, lit by two red flags of fever, the stiff black furze of a three-day beard was growing. The beard was somehow horrible; it recalled the corrupt vitality of hair, which can grow from a rotting corpse. And Ben's thin lips were lifted, in a constant grimace of torture and strangulation, about his white somehow dead-looking teeth, as inch by inch he gasped a thread of air into his lungs.",1
2603,"They gave us a vacation, Ben,"" he said presently. They had to close down on account of the flu. Then he turned away suddenly into the black murk, sick with his poor lie, and unable to face the fear in Ben's gray eyes.",1
2608,"Huh?  Hah? What say?"" asked Eliza, before any one had said anything. How is he? Her eyes darted about at them.",1
2609,"Get away! Get away! Get away! Eugene muttered savagely. His voice rose. Can't you get away? He was infuriated by the sailor's loud nervous breathing, his large awkward feet.",1
2618,"Eliza bustled about eagerly, pathetically busy, preparing breakfast. Once she hurried awkwardly upstairs with a kettle of water, and stood for a second at the door as Bessie Gant opened it, peering in at the terrible bed, with her white puckered face. Bessie Gant blocked her further entrance, and closed the door rudely. Eliza went away making flustered apologies.",1
2621,"And Eliza, stripped suddenly of her pretenses, clung to him, burying her white face in his coat sleeve, weeping bitterly, helplessly, grievously, for the sad waste of the irrevocable years-- the immortal hours of love that might never be relived, the great evil of forgetfulness and indifference that could never be righted now. Like a child she was grateful for his caress, and his heart twisted in him like a wild and broken thing, and he kept mumbling:  ""It's all right! It's all right! It's all right!""--knowing that it was not, could never be, all right.",1
2622,"If I had known. Child, if I had known,"" she wept, as she had wept long before at Grover's death. Brace up! he said. He'll pull through yet. The worst is over. Well, I tell you,"" said Eliza, drying her eyes at once, ""I believe it is.",1
2623,"I believe he passed the turning-point last night. I was saying to Bessie--""  The light grew. Day came, bringing hope. They sat down to breakfast in the kitchen, drawing encouragement from every scrap of cheer doctor or nurse would give them. Coker departed, non- committally optimistic. Bessie Gant came down to breakfast and was professionally encouraging.",1
2624,"If I can keep his damn family out of the room, he may have some chance of getting well. They laughed hysterically, gratefully, pleased with the woman's abuse. How is he this morning?"" said Eliza. Do you notice any improvement?""  ""His temperature is lower, if that's what you mean.",1
2625,"They knew that a lower temperature in the morning was a fact of no great significance, but they took nourishment from it: their diseased emotion fed upon it--they had soared in a moment to a peak of hopefulness. And he's got a good heart,"" said Bessie Gant. If that holds out, and he keeps fighting, he'll pull through. D-d-don't worry about his f-f-fighting,"" said Luke, in a rush of eulogy.",1
2626,"That b-b-boy'll fight as long as he's g-g-got a breath left in him. Why, yes,"" Eliza began, ""I remember when he was a child of seven-- I know I was standing on the porch one day--the reason I remember is Old Mr. Buckner had just come by with some butter and eggs your papa had--""  ""O my God! groaned Helen, with a loose grin. Now we'll get it. Whah--whah!",1
2627,"Luke chortled crazily, prodding Eliza in the ribs. I'll vow, boy!"" said Eliza angrily. You act like an idiot. I'd be ashamed!""  ""Whah--whah--whah!""  Helen sniggered, nudging Eugene.",1
2634,"There's one thing sure: I've done everything I could. I haven't been to bed for two days. Whatever happens, I'll have no regrets on that score. Her voice was filled with a brooding ugly satisfaction.",1
2635,"I know you haven't! I know that! The sailor turned to Eugene in his excitement, gesticulating. That g-g-girl's worked her fingers to the bone. If it hadn't been for her--""  His eyes got wet; he turned his head away and blew his nose.",1
2643,"And Eliza said, grimly:  ""If she calls up again you let me talk to her. I'll fix her!""  ""Good heavens, mama! Helen cried angrily. You've done enough already. You drove her out of the house when she'd done more for him than all his family put together. Her big strained features worked convulsively. Why, it's ridiculous!",1
2651,"Then, in a moment of fluttering consciousness, he recognized her. He grinned beautifully, with the thin swift flicker of his mouth. Hello, Helen! It's Helen! he cried eagerly.",1
2654,"Coker came in and went at once, without speaking, to the sick-room. Shortly before nine o'clock Bessie Gant came down. All right,"" she said quietly. You had all better come up now. This is the end. Eliza got up and marched out of the room with a stolid face.",1
2655,"Helen followed her: she was panting with hysteria, and had begun to wring her big hands. Now, get hold of yourself, Helen,"" said Bessie Gant warningly. This is no time to let yourself go. Eliza went steadily upstairs, making no noise.",1
2656,"But, as she neared the room, she paused, as if listening for sounds within. Faintly, in the silence, they heard Ben's song. And suddenly, casting away all pretense, Eliza staggered, and fell against the wall, turning her face into her hand, with a terrible wrenched cry:  ""O God!",1
2660,For God's sake! Eugene cried sharply. Pull yourself together! It's Ben who's dying--not us! Let's try to behave decently to him for once. This served to quiet Gant for a moment.,1
2662,"Hush! hush!"" cried Helen, rushing at him. In her furious anger, she seized him and shook him. You damned old man you, I could kill you! How dare you talk like that when your son's dying? I've wasted six years of my life nursing you, and you'll be the last one to go! In her blazing anger, she turned accusingly on Eliza:  ""You've done this to him.",1
2665,"Remember where you are. Yes, that means a lot to us,"" Eugene muttered bitterly. Then, over the ugly clamor of their dissension, over the rasp and snarl of their nerves, they heard the low mutter of Ben's expiring breath. The light had been re-shaded: he lay, like his own shadow, in all his fierce gray lonely beauty. And as they looked and saw his bright eyes already blurred with death, and saw the feeble beating flutter of his poor thin breast, the strange wonder, the dark rich miracle of his life surged over them its enormous loveliness. They grew quiet and calm, they plunged below all the splintered wreckage of their lives, they drew together in a superb communion of love and valiance, beyond horror and confusion, beyond death.",1
2679,"They sat waiting. Midnight came. A cock crew. Eugene went quietly to a window and stood looking out. The great beast of night prowled softly about the house. The walls, the windows seemed to bend inward from the thrusting pressure of the dark. The low noise in the wasted body seemed almost to have stopped. It came infrequently, almost inaudibly, with a faint fluttering respiration.",1
2698,"She shook her head. We never know. We'll talk about it some other time,"" said Helen.",1
2709,It's GOOD coffee. They howled. Eliza pursed her lips for a moment.,1
2716,"A cock crew his shrill morning cry of life beginning and awaking. The cock that crew at midnight (thought Eugene) had an elfin ghostly cry. His crow was drugged with sleep and death: it was like a far horn sounding under sea; and it was a warning to all the men who are about to die, and to the ghosts that must go home.",1
2726,"The maples were thin and sere. Their rotting leaves covered the ground. But the trees were not leafless yet. The leaves were quaking. Some birds began to chatter in the trees. Wind pressed the boughs, the withered leaves were shaking. It was October.",1
2734,"There was regret, a sense of wonder, in that office where the swift record of so many days had died--a memory that would not die, of something strange and passing. Damn!  I'm sorry! He was a great boy! said the men.",1
2741,"Have you got any of that?""  ""You don't need any one to fricassee your bull, son,"" said McGuire. You've got plenty as it is. Their bull-laughter bellowed in the beanery.",1
2744,"Make it two,"" said Luke, ""with a coupla cups of Mock-a, just like mother still makes. He looked crazily around at Eugene, and burst into loud whah-whahs, prodding him in the ribs. Where they got you stationed now, Luke?"" said Harry Tugman, peering up snoutily from a mug of coffee.",1
2747,"The sailor chortled madly. Good-morning, gentlemen,"" said Horse Hines, in an accent of refined sadness. Boys,"" he said, coming up to them sorrowfully, ""I was mighty sorry to hear of your trouble. I couldn't have thought more of that boy if he'd been my own brother. Don't go on, Horse,"" said McGuire, holding up four fat fingers of protest.",1
2748,"We can see you're heart-broken. If you go on, you may get hysterical with your grief, and break right out laughing. We couldn't bear that, Horse. We're big strong men, but we've had hard lives. I beg of you to spare us, Horse. Horse Hines did not notice him.",1
2751,"We know you'll d-d-do your best, Mr. Hines,"" said the sailor with ready earnest insincerity. That's the reason the family got you. Ain't you goin' to eat the rest of your steak?"" said the counter- man to Eugene.",1
2757,"Horse Hines glanced craftily up at him. Then he went back to his paper. The two young men left the lunch-room and walked homeward through the brisk morning. Eugene's mind kept fumbling with little things. There was a frosty snap and clatter of life upon the streets, the lean rattle of wheels, the creak of blinds, a cold rose-tint of pearled sky. In the Square, the motormen stood about among their cars, in loud foggy gossip. At Dixieland, there was an air of exhaustion, of nervous depletion. The house slept; Eliza alone was stirring, but she had a smart fire crackling in the range, and was full of business.",1
2770,"They're all good, Luke. I haven't got a bad piece of stock in the place. But--""  ""We want something b-b-b-better,"" said Luke earnestly.",1
2772,"You're the judge. If that's the best you've g-g-g-got, we'll take it. No, no! thought Eugene.",1
2777,"the sailor asked. Does it look all right to you?""  Do your Christmas shopping early. Yes,"" said Eugene, ""let's take it. I wish there were another color. I don't like black,"" he added. Haven't you got any other color? Horse Hines stared at him a moment.",1
2778,"Black IS the color,"" he said. Then, after a moment's silence, he went on:  ""Would you boys care to see the body?""  ""Yes,"" they said. He led them on tiptoe down the aisle of the coffins, and opened a door to a room behind. It was dark. They entered and stood with caught breath. Horse Hines switched on a light and closed the door.",1
2788,"There!"" he said, with deep satisfaction; and, rouge-stick in hand, head critically cocked, like a painter before his canvas, he stepped back into the terrible staring prison of their horror. There are artists, boys, in every profession,"" Horse Hines continued in a moment, with quiet pride, ""and though I do say it myself, Luke, I'm proud of my work on this job. Look at him! he exclaimed with sudden energy, and a bit of color in his gray face. Did you ever see anything more natural in your life? Eugene turned upon the man a grim and purple stare, noting with pity, with a sort of tenderness, as the dogs of laughter tugged at his straining throat the earnestness and pride in the long horse- face.",1
2793,"His burial was a final gesture of irony and futility: an effort to compensate carrion death for the unpaid wage of life--love and mercy. He had a grand funeral. All the Pentlands sent wreaths, and came with their separate clans, bringing along with their hastily assumed funeral manners a smell of recent business. Will Pentland talked with the men about politics, the war, and trade conditions, paring his nails thoughtfully, pursing his lips and nodding in his curiously reflective way, and occasionally punning with a birdy wink. His pleased self-laughter was mixed with Henry's loud guffaw. Pett, older, kinder, gentler than Eugene had ever seen her, moved about with a rustling of gray silk, and a relaxed bitterness. And Jim was there, with his wife, whose name Eugene forgot, and his four bright hefty daughters, whose names he confused, but who had all been to college and done well, and his son, who had been to a Presbyterian college, and had been expelled for advocating free love and socialism while editor of the college paper. Now he played the violin, and loved music, and helped his father with the business: he was an effeminate and mincing young man, but of the breed. And there was Thaddeus Pentland, Will's bookkeeper, the youngest and poorest of the three. He was a man past fifty, with a pleasant red face, brown mustaches, and a gentle placid manner. He was full of puns and pleased good-nature, save when he quoted from Karl Marx and Eugene Debs. He was a Socialist, and had once received eight votes for Congress. He was there with his garrulous wife (whom Helen called Jibber-Jibber) and his two daughters, languid good-looking blondes of twenty and twenty-four.",1
2797,"Presently the Scotch minister arrived: his decent soul lay above all the loud posturings of grief like a bolt of hard clean wool. He began the service for the dead in a dry nasal voice, remote, monotonous, cold, and passionate. Then, marshalled by Horse Hines, the pallbearers, young men from the paper and the town, who had known the dead man best, moved slowly out, gripping the coffin-handles with their nicotined fingers. In proper sequence, the mourners followed, lengthening out in closed victorias that exhaled their funeral scent of stale air and old leather.",1
2804,"When I think of it, I hate her. I shall never forget. And did you hear her? Did you? Already she's begun to pretend how much he loved her. But you can't fool me! I know! He wouldn't have her around. You saw that, didn't you? He kept calling for me. I was the only one he'd let come near him. You know that, don't you?""  ""You're the one who always has to be the goat,"" said Hugh Barton sourly.",1
2812,"Then, as the bright thing twisted about in him, Eugene heard the whine of the bleak wind about the house that he must leave, and the voice of Eliza calling up from the past the beautiful lost things that never happened. --and I said, 'Why, what on earth, boy, you want to dress up warm around your neck or you'll catch your death of cold.'""  Eugene caught at his throat and plunged for the door. Here, boy! Where are you going?"" said Eliza, looking up quickly.",1
2817,"It is not hard to go (he thought). But when can we forget? It was October and the leaves were quaking. Dusk was beginning. The sun had gone, the western ranges faded in chill purple mist, but the western sky still burned with ragged bands of orange. It was October.",1
2819,"He turned into an unpaved road by the big wooden sanitarium. He heard the rich kitchen laughter of the negroes, the larded sizzle of food, the dry veranda coughing of the lungers. He walked briskly along the lumpy road, with a dry scuffling of leaves. The air was a chill dusky pearl: above him a few pale stars were out. The town and the house were behind him. There was a singing in the great hill-pines.",1
2830,"We both came for the same reason, I suppose. Yes,"" said Mrs. Pert. Who'll be coming here this time next year, I wonder? Will Old 'Gene come back then?""  ""No,"" said Eugene.",1
2838,"Yes,"" said Eugene. I know that, Mrs. Pert. She stretched out her hands suddenly to him, and clasped his cold fingers.",1
2842,"His mind gathered itself out of the wreckage of little things: out of all that the world had shown or taught him he could remember now only the great star above the town, and the light that had swung over the hill, and the fresh sod upon Ben's grave, and the wind, and far sounds and music, and Mrs. Pert. Wind pressed the boughs, the withered leaves were shaking. It was October, but the leaves were shaking. A star was shaking. A light was waking. Wind was quaking. The star was far. The night, the light. The light was bright. A chant, a song, the slow dance of the little things within him. The star over the town, the light over the hill, the sod over Ben, night over all. His mind fumbled with little things. Over us all is something. Star, night, earth, light . . . light . . . O lost! . . . a stone . . . a leaf . . . a door . . . O ghost! . . . a light . . . a song . . . a light . . . a light swings over the hill . . . over us all . . . a star shines over the town . . . over us all . . . a light.",1
2843,"We shall not come again. We never shall come back again. But over us all, over us all, over us all is--something.",1
2844,"Wind pressed the boughs; the withered leaves were shaking. It was October, but some leaves were shaking. A light swings over the hill. (We shall not come again.) And over the town a star. (Over us all, over us all that shall not come again.) And over the day the dark. But over the darkness--what?  We shall not come again.",1
2854,"Sometimes, when he walked softly by, he heard the young men talking in their rooms of Eugene Gant. Eugene Gant was crazy. Eugene Gant was mad. Oh, I (he thought) am Eugene Gant!",1
2856,"He caught the claw of his hand into his lean throat. They are talking of me, of me! I am Eugene Gant--the conqueror of nations, lord of the earth, the Siva of a thousand beautiful forms.",1
2863,"But if, he thought, I lose only one every two years after I am twenty, I shall still have over fifteen left when I am fifty, since we have thirty-two, including wisdom-teeth. And it will not look so bad, if only I can save the front ones. Then, with his hope in futures, he thought: But by that time perhaps the dentists can give me real ones. He read several dental magazines to see if there was any hope for the transplanting of sound teeth for old ones. Then, with brooding satisfaction, he studied his sensual deeply scalloped mouth with the pouting underlip, noting that even when he smiled he barely revealed his teeth.",1
2871,"He was desperately afraid of people in crowds: at class meetings, or smokers, or at any public gathering, he was nervous and constrained until he began to talk to them, and got them under him. He was always afraid that some one would make a joke about him, and that he would be laughed at. But he was not afraid of any man alone: he felt that he could handle any one if he got him away from his crowd. Remembering his savage fear and hatred of the crowd, with a man alone he could play cruelly, like a cat, snarling gently at him, prowling in on him softly, keeping cocked and silent the terrible tiger's paw of his spirit. All of their starch oozed out of them; they seemed to squeak and twitter, and look round for the door. He would get some loud pompous yokel--the student president of the Y. M. C. A., or the class president--and bear down on him with evil gentle matter-of-factness.",1
2876,"But what, said Eugene very slowly into the darkness, if I'm not a Genius? He did not ask himself the question often. He was alone: he spoke aloud, but in a low voice, in order to feel the unreality of this blasphemy. It was a moonless night, full of stars. There was no thunder and no lightning.",1
2878,"Then, as was his custom, when he had burnt his heart out, he began to look nakedly and critically at the question. Well, he went on very calmly, what if I'm not? Am I going to cut my throat, or eat worms, or swallow arsenic? He shook his head slowly but emphatically. No, he said, I am not. Besides, there are enough geniuses. They have at least one in every high school, and one in the orchestra of every small-town movie. Sometimes Mrs. Von Zeck, the wealthy patroness of the arts, sends a genius or two off to New York to study. So that, he estimated, this broad land of ours has by the census not less than 26,400 geniuses and 83,752 artists, not counting those in business and advertising. For his personal satisfaction, Eugene then muttered over the names of 21 geniuses who wrote poetry, and 37 more who devoted themselves to the drama and the novel. After this, he felt quite relieved.",1
2879,"What, he thought, can I be, besides a genius? I've been one long enough. There must be better things to do.",1
2880,"Over that final hedge, he thought, not death, as I once believed-- but new life--and new lands. Erect, with arm akimbo on his hip, he stood, his domed head turned out toward the light: sixty, subtle and straight of body, deep- browed, with an old glint of hawk-eyes, lean apple-cheeks, a mustache bristle-cropped. That face on which the condor Thought has fed, arched with high subtle malice, sophist glee.",1
2884,Ironic eyebrows ask their laughter. They snicker smugly for the wolf that will devour them. Mr. Willis says a stick is a piece of wood. Their laughter rattles against the walls.,1
2887,"It is the meeting in Space of Wood and No-Wood. A stick is finite and unextended wood, a fact determined by its own denial. The old head listens gravely above the ironic intake of their breath.",1
2888,"He will bear me out and praise me, for I am measured against this peasant earth. He sees me with the titles of proud office; and he loves victory. We have a new name for him, Professor Weldon,"" said Nick Mabley. We call him Hegel Gant. He listened to their shout of laughter; he saw their pleased faces turn back on him.",1
2894,"I think it might be painful,"" Vergil Weldon suggested. Even a little blister hurts. Who wants to be burned for anything?"" said Eugene.",1
2902,"Isn't there an h in that name?"" he said. No,"" said Eugene. That's another branch of the family. I have an uncle, Samuel, who spells his name that way. Sometimes, at hotels of ill-repute, he would register, with dark buried glee, as ""Robert Browning,"" ""Alfred Tennyson,"" and ""William Wordsworth.",1
2905,"He felt a desperate frustration, as if he were being shut out from the rich banquet of life. And against all caution, he determined to break the pattern of custom, and look within. Driven on by this hunger, he would suddenly rush away from Pulpit Hill and, as dusk came on, prowl up and down the quiet streets of towns. Finally, lifted beyond all restraint, he would mount swiftly to a door and ring the bell. Then, to whoever came, reeling against the wall and clutching at his throat, he would say:  ""Water!",1
2912,"But what, thought Eugene, if one day, in the million streets of life, I should really find him? These were the golden years.    39   Gant and Eliza came to his graduation. He found them lodgings in the town: it was early June--hot, green, fiercely and voluptuously Southern. The campus was a green oven; the old grads went about in greasy pairs; the cool pretty girls, who never sweated, came in to see their young men graduate, and to dance; the mamas and papas were shown about dumbly and shyly.",1
2914,"On this rich stage, Gant, who had left his charnel-house of death for three days, saw his son Eugene. He came, gathered to life again, out of his grave. He saw his son enthroned in all the florid sentiment of commencement, and the whole of his heart was lifted out of the dust. Upon the lordly sward, shaded by great trees, and ringed by his solemn classmen and their families, Eugene read the Class Poem (""O Mother Of Our Myriad Hopes""). Then Vergil Weldon spoke, high-husky, deep, and solemn-sad; and Living Truth welled in their hearts. It was a Great Utterance. Be true! Be clean! Be good! Be men! Absorb the Negation! The world has need of. Life was never so worth. Never in history had there been. No other class had shown so great a promise as. Among other achievements, the editor of the paper had lifted the moral and intellectual level of the State two inches. The university spirit! Character! Service! Leadership!",1
2915,Eugene's face grew dark with pride and joy there in the lovely wilderness. He could not speak. There was a glory in the world: life was panting for his embrace.,1
2917,"Well, son,"" said Gant, ""the rest is up to you now. I believe you're going to make a name for yourself. He laid a great dry hand clumsily upon his son's shoulder, and for a moment Eugene saw in the dead eyes the old dark of umber and unfound desire.",1
2918,"Hm!"" Eliza began, with a tremulous bantering smile, ""your head will get turned by all the things they're saying about you. She took his hand in her rough warm grasp. Her eyes grew suddenly wet.",1
2920,"I'll do something,"" he said. I will. They looked shyly at his strange dark face, with all its passionate and naïve ardor, and they felt tenderness and love for his youth and all that was unknown to it.",1
2922,"Merciful God! he whined. Why did I ever come! O Jesus, how will I ever face that trip again! I can't bear it. I'll die before I get there! It's fearful, it's awful, it's cruel. And he wept weak snuffling sobs.",1
2924,"Well, son,"" said Eliza, in the quiet moment before departure. Have you thought yet of what you're going to do?""  ""Yes,"" said Gant, wetting his thumb, ""for you've got to shift for yourself from now on. You've had the best education money can buy. The rest is up to you. I'll talk to you in a few days when I see you at home,"" said Eugene.",1
2925,"I'll tell you about it then. Mercifully the train began to move: he kissed them quickly and ran down the aisle. He had nothing to tell them. He was nineteen; he had completed his college course; but he did not know what he was going to do. His father's plan that he should study law and ""enter politics"" had been forgotten since his sophomore year, when it became apparent that the impulse of his life was not toward law. His family felt obscurely that he was an eccentric--""queer,"" they called it--and of an impractical or ""literary"" turn.",1
2927,"But Eugene was untroubled by thought of a goal. He was mad with such ecstasy as he had never known. He was a centaur, moon-eyed and wild of mane, torn apart with hunger for the golden world. He became at times almost incapable of coherent speech. While talking with people, he would whinny suddenly into their startled faces, and leap away, his face contorted with an idiot joy. He would hurl himself squealing through the streets and along the paths, touched with the ecstasy of a thousand unspoken desires. The world lay before him for his picking--full of opulent cities, golden vintages, glorious triumphs, lovely women, full of a thousand unmet and magnificent possibilities. Nothing was dull or tarnished. The strange enchanted coasts were unvisited. He was young and he could never die.",1
2934,"Then, turning, he plunged off blindly down the path. He still loitered, although his baggage had been packed for days. With a desperate pain, he faced departure from that Arcadian wilderness where he had known so much joy. At night he roamed the deserted campus, talking quietly until morning with a handful of students who lingered strangely, as he did, among the ghostly buildings, among the phantoms of lost boys. He could not face a final departure. He said he would return early in autumn for a few days, and at least once a year thereafter.",1
2936,"Eugene stood up in the car and waved his long arm in a gesture of farewell. Good-bye,"" he cried. Good-bye.""  The old man stood up with a quiet salute of parting, slow, calm, eloquently tender.",1
2938,"Far-forested, the horn-note wound. He was wild with the hunger for release: the vast champaign of earth stretched out for him its limitless seduction. It was the end, the end. It was the beginning of the voyage, the quest of new lands.",1
2940,"Except for Eliza. She was sixty, sound of body and mind, triumphantly healthy. She still ran Dixieland, but she had given up the boarders for roomers, and most of the duties of management she intrusted to an old maid who lived in the house. Eliza devoted most of her time to real estate.",1
2941,"She had, during the past year, got final control of Gant's property. She had begun to sell it immediately and ruthlessly, over his indifferent mutter of protest. She had sold the old house on Woodson Street for $7,000--a good enough price, she had said, considering the neighborhood. But, stark, bare, and raw, stripped of its girdling vines, annex now to a quack's sanitarium for ""nervous diseases,"" the rich labor of their life was gone. In this, more than in anything else, Eugene saw the final  disintegration of his family.",1
2944,"Gant was fed and cared for by Helen. She moved back and forth in ceaseless fret between Eliza's house and Hugh Barton's, in constant rhythms of wild energy and depletion, anger, hysteria, weariness and indifference. She had had no children and, it seemed, would have none. For this reason, she had long periods of brooding morbidity, during which she drugged herself with nibbling potations of patent tonics, medicines with a high alcoholic content, home- made wines, and corn whiskey. Her large eyes grew lustreless and dull, her big mouth had a strain of hysteria about it, she would pluck at her long chin and burst suddenly into tears. She talked restlessly, fretfully, incessantly, wasting and losing herself in a net of snarled nerves, in endless gossip, incoherent garrulity about the townsfolk, the neighbors, disease, doctors, hospitals, death.",1
2945,"The deliberate calm of Hugh Barton sometimes goaded her to a frenzy. He would sit at night, oblivious of her tirade, gravely chewing his long cigar, absorbed in his charts, or in a late issue of System or of The American Magazine. This power of losing himself in solitary absorption would madden her. She did not know what she wanted, but his silence before her exasperated indictment of life drove her to frenzy. She would rush at him with a sob of rage, knock the magazine from his hands, and seize his thinning hair in the grip of her long fingers.",1
2947,"What do you want me to say?""  It seemed, indeed, when she was in this temper, that she could not be pleased. She was annoyed and irritable if people agreed carefully with all her utterances; she was annoyed equally by their disagreement and by their silence. A remark about the weather, the most studiously uncontroversial opinion, aroused her annoyance.",1
2961,"Then, as Steve sprawled dazed and witless on the floor, Luke sprang upon him with stammering curse, and, past reason, began to drag him up and down. And Eugene sprang upon Luke to stop him, and all three stammered and cursed and begged and accused, while the roomers huddled at the door, and Eliza wept, calling for help, and Daisy, who was up from the South with her children, wrung her plump hands, moaning ""Oh, they'll kill him! They'll kill him. Have mercy on me and my poor little children, I beg of you. Then the shame, the disgust, the maudlin grievance, the weeping women, the excited men.",1
2966,"He thought of her only as a very chill and respectable woman. He played Casino--the only game he knew--with her and the other boarders, and called her ""ma'am. Then one night she took his hand, saying she would show him how to make love to a girl. She tickled the palm, put it around her waist, lifted it to her breast, and plumped over on his shoulder, breathing stertorously through her pinched nostrils and saying, ""God, boy! over and over. He plunged around the dark cool streets until three in the morning, wondering what he would do about it. Then he came back to the sleeping house, and crept on shoeless feet into her room. Fear and disgust were immediate. He climbed the hills to ease his tortured spirit and stayed away from the house for hours. But she would follow him down the halls or open her door suddenly on him, clad in a red kimono. She became very ugly and bitter, and accused him of betraying, dishonoring, and deserting her. She said that where she came from--the good old State of South Carolina--a man who treated a woman in such fashion would get a bullet in him. Eugene thought of new lands. He was in an agony of repentance and guilty abasement: he framed a long plea for pardon and included it in his prayers at night, for he still prayed, not from devout belief, but from the superstition of habit and number, muttering a set formula over sixteen times, while he held his breath. Since childhood he had believed in the magical efficacy of certain numbers--on Sunday he would do only the second thing that came into his head and not the first--and this intricate ritual of number and prayer he was a slave to, not to propitiate God, but to fulfil a mysterious harmonic relation with the universe, or to pay worship to the demonic force that brooded over him. He could not sleep of nights until he did this.",1
2969,"That's mighty big talk, boy. Where are you going to get the money?""  ""I can get it,"" he said darkly. People will lend it to me. No, son,"" she said with instant grave caution.",1
2974,"Eliza pursed her lips for a moment. Well,"" she said, at length. I'll send you for a year. Then we'll see.",1
2976,"Oh, just a little form Hugh wants you to sign, in case anything should happen. It's a release. A release from what?"" said Eugene, staring at it.",1
2987,"The marvellous hills were blooming in the dusk. Eliza pursed her lips reflectively a moment, then continued: Well, when you get way up there--as the fellow says--in Yankeedom, you want to look up your Uncle Emerson and all your Boston kin. Your Aunt Lucy took a great liking to you when they were down here-- they always said they'd be glad to see any of us if we ever came up--when you're a stranger in a strange land it's mighty good sometimes to have some one you know. And say--when you see your Uncle Emerson, you might just tell him not to be surprised to see me at any time now"" (she nodded pertly at him)--""I reckon I can pick right up and light out the same as the next fellow when I get ready--I may just pack up and come--without saying a word to any one--I'm not going to spend all my days slaving away in the kitchen--it don't pay--if I can turn a couple of trades here this Fall, I may start out to see the world like I always intended to--I was talking to Cash Rankin about it the other day--'Why, Mrs. Gant,' he said, 'if I had your head I'd be a rich man in five years--you're the best trader in this town,' he said. 'Don't you talk to me about any more trades,' I said--'when I get rid of what I've got now I'm going to get out of it, and not even listen to any one who says real-estate to me--we can't take any of it with us, Cash,' I said--'there are no pockets in shrouds and we only need six feet of earth to bury us in the end--so I'm going to pull out and begin to enjoy life--or as the feller says--before it's too late'--'Well, I don't know that I blame you, Mrs. Gant,' he said-- 'I reckon you're right--we can't take any of it with us,' he said-- 'and besides, even if we could, what good would it do us where we're goin'?'--Now here"" (she addressed Eugene with sudden change, with the old looser masculine gesture of her hand)--""here's the thing I'm going to do--you know that lot I told you I owned on Sunset Crescent--",1
2991,"Poor child! Poor child! Then she whispered huskily, faintly:  ""We must try to love one another. The terrible and beautiful sentence, the last, the final wisdom that the earth can give, is remembered at the end, is spoken too late, wearily.",1
2993,And now the voyage out. Where?    40   The Square lay under blazing moonlight. The fountain pulsed with a steady breezeless jet: the water fell upon the pool with a punctual slap. No one came into the Square.,1
2994,"The chimes of the bank's clock struck the quarter after three as Eugene entered from the northern edge, by Academy Street. He came slowly over past the fire department and the City Hall. On Gant's corner, the Square dipped sharply down toward Niggertown, as if it had been bent at the edge.",1
2996,"Leaning against the iron railing of the porch, above the sidewalk, a man stood smoking. Troubled and a little afraid, Eugene came over. Slowly, he mounted the long wooden steps, looking carefully at the man's face. It was half-obscured in shadow.",1
2999,"In a moment, he added in a surly voice:  ""Who did you think it was, you little idiot?""  ""I wasn't sure,"" said Eugene somewhat timidly. I couldn't see your face. They were silent a moment.",1
3003,"I hope,"" he began presently, with a small cracked laugh, ""I hope, then, this doesn't mean that I'm crazy?""  ""Why not?"" said Ben, with a swift flickering grin. Of course you're crazy. Then,"" said Eugene slowly, ""I'm imagining all this?""  ""In heaven's name!",1
3017,"Until I what?"" said Ben.  There was a pause. You are dead, Ben,"" Eugene muttered. You must be dead. I saw you die, Ben. His voice rose sharply. I tell you, I saw you die. Don't you remember? The front room upstairs that the dentist's wife has now? Don't you remember, Ben?  Coker, Helen, Bessie Gant who nursed you, Mrs. Pert? The oxygen tank? I tried to hold your hands together when they gave it to you. His voice rose to a scream. Don't you remember? I tell you, you are dead, Ben.""  ""Fool,"" said Ben fiercely.",1
3026,"Then, what are you?"" said Eugene with strong excitement. You are dead, Ben. In a moment, more quietly, he added:  ""Or do men die? How should I know,"" said Ben.  ""They say papa is dying.",1
3035,"His voice strangled in his throat: the boy had gone, leaving the memory of his bewitched and listening face turned to the hidden world. O lost! And now the Square was thronging with their lost bright shapes, and all the minutes of lost time collected and stood still. Then, shot from them with projectile speed, the Square shrank down the rails of destiny, and was vanished with all things done, with all forgotten shapes of himself and Ben.",1
3046,"On the brink of the dark he stood, with only the dream of the cities, the million books, the spectral images of the people he had loved, who had loved him, whom he had known and lost. They will not come again. They never will come back again.",1
3048,"You have been nowhere. But in the cities?""  ""There are none. There is one voyage, the first, the last, the only one. On coasts more strange than Cipango, in a place more far than Fez, I shall hunt him, the ghost and haunter of myself.",1
3049,"I have lost the blood that fed me; I have died the hundred deaths that lead to life. By the slow thunder of the drums, the flare of dying cities, I have come to this dark place. And this is the true voyage, the good one, the best. And now prepare, my soul, for the beginning hunt. I will plumb seas stranger than those haunted by the Albatross. He stood naked and alone in darkness, far from the lost world of the streets and faces; he stood upon the ramparts of his soul, before the lost land of himself; heard inland murmurs of lost seas, the far interior music of the horns.",1
3052,"And the angels on Gant's porch were frozen in hard marble silence, and at a distance life awoke, and there was a rattle of lean wheels, a slow clangor of shod hoofs. And he heard the whistle wail along the river. Yet, as he stood for the last time by the angels of his father's porch, it seemed as if the Square already were far and lost; or, I should say, he was like a man who stands upon a hill above the town he has left, yet does not say ""The town is near,"" but turns his eyes upon the distant soaring ranges.",1
3054,"The air was strangely quiet. All the noises of the city were muted here into a distant hum, so unceasing that it seemed to belong to silence. Suddenly, through the open windows at the front of the house came the raucous splutter of a truck starting up at the loading platform of the warehouse across the street. The heavy motor warmed up with a full-throated roar, then there was a grinding clash of gears, and George felt the old house tremble under him as the truck swung out into the street and thundered off. The noise receded, grew fainter, then faded into the general hum, and all was quiet as before.",1
3058,"Thus, fleeing from a love that still pursued him, he had become a wanderer in strange countries. He had travelled through England, France, and Germany, had seen countless new sights and people, and--cursing, whoring, drinking, brawling his way across the continent--had had his head bashed in, some teeth knocked out, and his nose broken in a beer-hall fight. And then, in the solitude of convalescence in a Munich hospital, lying in bed upon his back with his ruined face turned upwards towards the ceiling, he had had nothing else to do but think. There, at last, he had learned a little sense. There his madness had gone out of him, and for the first time in many years he had felt at peace within himself.",1
3064,"He was twenty-eight years old now, and wise enough to know that there are sometimes reasons of which the reason knows nothing, and that the emotional pattern of one's life, formed and set by years of living, is not to be discarded quite as easily as one may throw away a battered hat or worn-out shoe. Well, he was not the first man to be caught on the horns of this dilemma. Had not even the philosophers themselves been similarly caught? Yes--and then written sage words about it:  ""A foolish consistency,"" Emerson had said, ""is the hobgoblin of little minds.",1
3065,"And great Goethe, accepting the inevitable truth that human growth does not proceed in a straight line to its goal, had compared the development and progress of mankind to the reelings of a drunken beggar on horseback. What was important, perhaps, was not that the beggar was drunk and reeling, but that he was mounted on his horse, and, however unsteadily, was going somewhere.",1
3072,"I didn't do it! she gasped. I didn't write it! I can't help it if they write like that! Isn't it awful? Yes, and you hate it, don't you?",1
3078,"It will feed your hunger as you've never been fed before. It will be like a living miracle, and will make you better and richer as long as you live. You will never forget it. It will be a glory and a triumph. Then this will be such food as no one ever ate before,"" he said.",1
3081,"The most important thing about it, however, was that this was his place, not theirs, and that fact re-established their relations on a different level. Henceforth he was determined not to let his life and love be one. She had her world of the theatre and of her rich friends which he did not want to belong to, and he had his world of writing which he would have to manage alone. He would keep love a thing apart, and safeguard to himself the mastery of his life, his separate soul, his own integrity.",1
3082,"Would she accept this compromise? Would she take his love, but leave him free to live his life and do his work? That was the way he told her it must be, and she said yes, she understood. But could she do it? Was it in a woman's nature to be content with all that a man could give her, and not for ever want what was not his to give? Already there were little portents that made him begin to doubt it.",1
3084,"she asked, a little breathless. Will you go on loving me for ever? Her abrupt change of mood and her easy assumption that he or any human being could honestly pledge himself to anyone or anything for ever struck him as ludicrous, and he laughed.",1
3088,"Esther watched him a minute or two, feeling disappointed and hurt that he had not answered her. He stopped by the front window and stood looking out, and she went over to him and quietly put her arm through his. She saw the vein swell in his temple, and knew there was no use in speaking.",1
3092,"The motors roared by like projectiles, and people were passing along the pavement. There were the faces George and Esther had never seen before, and there were the faces they had always seen, everywhere: always different, they never changed; they welled up from the sourceless springs of life with unending fecundity, with limitless variety, with incessant movement, and with the monotony of everlasting repetition. There were the three girl-friends who pass along the streets of life for ever. One had a cruel and sensual face, she wore glasses, and her mouth was hard and vulgar. Another had the great nose and the little bony features of a rat. The face of the third was full and loose, jeering with fat rouged lips and oily volutes of the nostrils. And when they laughed, there was no warmth or joy in the sound: high, shrill, ugly, and hysterical, their laughter only asked the earth to notice them.",1
3093,"In the street the children played. They were dark and strong and violent, aping talk and toughness from their elders. They leaped on one another and hurled the weakest to the pavement. The policemen herded the noisy little tailors along before them, and they went away. The sky was blue and young and vital, there were no clouds in it; the trees were budding into leaf; the sunlight fell into the street, upon all the people there, with an innocent and fearless life.",1
3101,"But now she said the Rodney people were interested. Well, they had taken their time about it. And what did ""interested"" mean? Very likely they would tell him they had detected in the book some slight traces of a talent which, with careful nursing, could be schooled to produce, in time, a publishable book. He had heard that publishers sometimes had a weather eye for this sort of thing and that they would often string an aspiring author along for years, giving him just the necessary degree, of encouragement to keep him from abandoning hope altogether and to make him think that they had faith in his great future if only he would go on writing book after rejected book until he ""found himself"". Well, he'd show them that he was not their fool! Not by so much as a flicker of an eyelash would he betray his disappointment, and he would commit himself to nothing!",1
3102,"If the traffic policeman on the corner noticed a strange young man in front of the office of James Rodney & Co. that morning, he would never have guessed at the core of firm resolution with which this young man had tried to steel himself for the interview that lay before him. If the policeman saw him at all, he probably observed him with misgiving, wondering whether he ought not to intervene to prevent the commission of a felony, or at any rate whether he ought not to speak to the young man and hold him in conversation until the ambulance could arrive and take him to Bellevue for observation. For, as the young man approached the building at a rapid, loping stride, a stern scowl upon his face and his lips set in a grim line, he had hardly crossed the street and set his foot upon the kerb before the publisher's building when his step faltered, he stopped and looked about him as if not knowing what to do, and then, in evident confusion, forced himself to go on. ' But now his movements were uncertain; as if his legs obeyed his will with great reluctance. He lunged ahead, then stopped, then lunged again and made for the door, only to halt again in a paroxysm of indecision as he came up to it. He stood there facing the door for a moment, clenching and unclenching his hands, then looked about him quickly, suspiciously, as though he expected to find somebody watching him. At last, with a slight shudder of resolution, he thrust his hands deep into his pockets, turned deliberately, and walked on past the door.",1
3103,"And now he moved slowly, the line of his mouth set grimmer than before, and his head was carried stiffly forward from the shoulders as if he were trying to hold himself to the course he had decided upon by focusing on some distant object straight before him. But all the while, as he went along before the entrance and the show windows filled with books which flanked it on both sides, he peered sharply out of the corner of his eye like a spy who had to find out what was going on inside the building without letting the passers-by observe his interest. He walked to the end of the block and turned about and then came back, and again as he passed in front of the publishing house he kept his face fixed straight ahead and looked stealthily out of the corner of his eye. For fifteen or twenty minutes he repeated this strange manoeuvred, and each time as he approached the door he-would hesitate and half turn as if about to enter, and then abruptly go on as before.",1
3109,"Rodney's Magazine, too, had become interested in the young author and was going to publish a story, a chapter from the book, in their next number. This news added immensely to his excitement. He was eager to see his name in print, and in the happy interval of expectancy he felt like a kind of universal Don Juan, for he literally loved everybody--his fellow instructors at the school, his drab students, the little shopkeepers in all the stores, even the nameless hordes that thronged the streets. Rodney's, of course, was the greatest and the finest publishing house in all the world, and Foxhall Edwards was the greatest editor and the finest man that ever was. George had liked him instinctively from the first, and now, like an old and intimate friend, he was calling him Fox. George knew that Fox believed in him, and the editor's faith and confidence, coming as it had come, at a time when George had given up all hope, restored his self-respect and charged him with energy for new work.",1
3111,"When Rodney's Magazine came out with the story, George fully expected convulsions of the earth, falling meteors, suspension of traffic in the streets, and a general strike. But nothing happened. A few of his friends mentioned it, but that was all. For several days he felt let down, but then his common sense reassured him that people couldn't really tell much about a new author from a short piece in a magazine. The book would show them who he was and what he could do. It would be different then. He could afford to wait a little longer for the fame which he was certain would soon be his.",1
3118,"Yes,"" Hauser would say. I read it. Well, what did you think of it?",1
3119,"(Confound it, can't the fellow say what he thinks without having to be asked all the timer)""  ""I think it is a work of genius. Incredulously: ""You do!""  ""I do, yes. To my mind there is no question about it. But look here, Hauser--"" excitedly--""if what you say is true, this boy--the fellow who wrote it--why, he's just a kid--no one ever heard of him before--comes from somewhere out West--Nebraska, Iowa, one of those places--never been anywhere, apparently--if what you say is true, we've made a discovery!",1
3121,"Here he makes a discovery like this--an astounding statement of this sort--and shows no more enthusiasm than if he were discussing a cabbage head!)--but, see here, then! You--you mean there's something wrong with it?""  ""No, I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I think it is a magnificent piece of writing. But--(Good Lord, the fellow is a queer fish!)--but you mean to say that--that perhaps it's not suitable for publication in its present form?",1
3123,"Yes.""  ""I thought so, too,"" said the editor shrewdly. Of course, the fellow shows he knows very little about writing. He doesn't know how he does it, he repeats himself continually, he is childish and exuberant and extravagant, and he does ten times too much of everything.. We have a hundred other writers who know more about writing than he does. I suppose we have, yes,"" Hauser agreed.",1
3131,"Then they may not see this book as the work of genius which you say it is. Do you think they will?""  ""I can't say. Perhaps not. However, it doesn't matter. Doesn't matter!",1
3132,"Why, what do you mean?""  ""I mean that the thing is good, and cannot be destroyed. Therefore it doesn't matter what anyone says. Then--Good Lord, Hauser!--if what you say is true, we've made a great discovery!""  ""I think you have.",1
3135,"The people at Rodney's couldn't understand it. They didn't know what to make of it. Finally, they had given up trying, all except Fox Edwards--and Fox would never give up trying to understand anything. Fox still came by Hauser's office--his little cell--and looked in on him. Fox's old grey hat would be pushed back on his head, for he never took it off when he worked, and there would be a look of troubled wonder in his sea-pale eyes as he bent over and stooped and craned and stared at Hauser, as if he were regarding for the first time some fantastic monster from the marine jungles of the ocean. Then he would turn and walk away, hands hanging to his coat lapels, and in his eyes there would be a look of utter astonishment.",1
3136,"Fox couldn't understand it yet. As for Hauser himself, he had no answers, nothing to tell them. It was not until George Webber had become well acquainted with both men that be began to penetrate the mystery. Foxhall Edwards and Otto Hauser--to know them both, to see them working in the same office, each in his own way, was to understand them both as perhaps neither could have been understood completely by himself. Each man, by being what he was, revealed to George the secret springs of character which had made the two of them so much alike--and so utterly different.",1
3146,"Will you--have some tea--with me--yis? He spoke the words very slowly, with a deliberate formality, after which he flashed a quick, eager, and ingratiating smile. George told him he would be glad to, and got his coat and started downstairs with him. Katamoto padded swiftly on ahead, his little feet shod in felt slippers that made no sound. Half-way down the stairs, as if the noise of George's heavy tread had touched his funny-bone again, Katamoto stopped quickly, turned and pointed at George's feet, and giggled coyly: ""Tramp-ling! You are trampling! Then he turned and fairly fled away down the stairs and down the hall, shrieking like a gleeful child. He waited at the door to usher his guest in, introduced him to the slender, agile little Japanese girl who seemed to stay there all the time, and finally brought George back into his studio and served him tea.",1
3149,"George asked a question about the big plaster cast in the centre of the room, and Katamoto took him over and showed it to him, remarking as he pointed to the creature's huge feet:  ""He is--like you!... He is tramp-ling!...Yis!... He is tramp-ling!",1
3156,"After that, of course, George wore slippers. But sometimes he would forget, and the next morning Katamoto would be rapping at his door again. He was never angry, he was always patient and good-humoured, he was always beautifully courteous--but he would always call George to account. You were tramp-ling! he would cry. Last night--again--tramp-ling! And George would tell him he was sorry and would try not to do it again, and Katamoto would go away giggling, pausing to turn and wag his finger roguishly and call out once more, ""Tramp-ling!""--after which he would flee downstairs, shrieking with laughter.",1
3158,"And the movers would carry out of the house and stow into their van the enormous piecemeal fragments of some North Dakota Pericles, whose size was so great that one wondered how this dapper, fragile little man could possibly have fashioned such a leviathan. Then the movers would depart, and for a space Mr. Katamoto would loaf and invite his soul. He would come out in the backyard with his girl, the slender, agile little Japanese--who looked as, if she had some Italian blood in her as well--and for hours at a time they would play at handball. Mr. Katamoto would knock the ball up against the projecting brick wall of the house next door, and every time he scored a point he would scream with laughter, clapping his small hands together, bending over weakly and pressing his hand against his stomach, and staggering about with delight and merriment. Choking with laughter, he would cry out in a high, delirious voice as rapidly as he could:  ""Yis, yis, yis!",1
3161,"If the son-of-a-bitch stepped on you with that foot, he wouldn't leave a grease spot, would he, Joe?""  The last piece of all was an immense fragment of the Solon's arm and fist, with one huge forefinger pointed upwards in an attitude of solemn objurgation and avowal. That figure was Katamoto's masterpiece; and George felt as he saw it pass that the enormous upraised finger was the summit of his art and the consummation of his life: Certainly it was the apple of his eye. George had never seen him before in such a state of extreme agitation. He fairly prayed above the sweating men: It was obvious that the coarse indelicacy of their touch made him shudder. The grin was frozen on his face in an expression of congealed terror. He writhed, he wriggled, he wrung his little hands, he crooned to them. And if anything had happened to that fat, pointed finger, George felt sure that he would have dropped dead on the spot.",1
3166,"And you see finger?""  ""Yes, Kato. And you like?""--quickly, earnestly.  ""Very much.""  ""Big finger--yis?""--with a note of rising triumph in his ""Very big, Kato.""  ""And pointing--yis?"" he said ecstatically, grinning from ear to ear and pointing his own small finger heavenward. Yes, pointing. He sighed contentedly.",1
3174,"out of the corners of their mouths. Surly, they stood upon their rights, defending truculently the narrow frontier of their duty:  ""Wadda I care where it goes! Dat's yoeh look-out! Wat t'hell's it got to do wit me?""  They worked with speed and power and splendid aptness, furiously, unamiably, with high, exacerbated voices, spurred and goaded by their harsh unrest.",1
3178,"In the raw days of early spring they had worn shirts of thick black wool and leather jackets, but now, in summer, their arms were naked, tattooed, brown, and lean with the play of whipcord muscles. The power and precision with which they worked stirred in George a deep emotion of respect, and also touched him with humility. For whenever he saw it, his own life, with its conflicting desires, its uncertain projects and designs, its labours begun in hope and so often ended in incompletion, by comparison with the lives of these men who, had learned to use their strength and talents perfectly, seemed faltering, blind, and baffled.",1
3184,"Before him, all that summer of 1929, in the broad window of the warehouse, a man sat at a desk and looked out into the street, in a posture that never changed. George saw him there whenever he glanced across, yet he never saw him do anything but look out of the window with a fixed, abstracted stare. At first the man had been such an unobtrusive part of his surroundings that he had seemed to fade into' them, and had gone almost unnoticed. Then Esther, having observed him there, pointed to him one day and said merrily:  ""There's our friend in the Distributing Corp again!",1
3185,"What do you suppose he distributes? I've never seen him do anything! Have you noticed him--hah?"" she cried eagerly. God! It's the strangest thing I ever saw! She laughed richly, made a shrug of bewildered protest, and, after a moment, said with serious wonder: ""Isn't it queer? What do you suppose a man like that can do? What do you suppose he's thinking of?""  ""Oh, I don't know,"" George said indifferently.",1
3186,"Of nothing, I suppose. Then they forgot the man and turned to talk of other things, yet from that moment the man's singular presence was pricked out in George's mind and he began to watch him with hypnotic fascination, puzzled by the mystery of his immobility and his stare. And after that, as soon as Esther came in every day, she would glance across the street and cry out in a jolly voice which had in it the note of affectionate satisfaction and assurance that people have when they see some familiar and expected object:  ""Well, I see our old friend, The Distributing Corp, is still looking out of his window!",1
3188,"George protested that her rhyme made no sense, but she threw back her encrimsoned face and screamed with laughter. But after a while they stopped laughing about the man. For, obscure as his employment seemed, incredible and comical as his indolence had been when they first noticed it, there came to be something impressive, immense, and formidable in the quality of that fixed stare. Day by day, a thronging traffic of life and business passed before him in the street; day by day, the great vans came, the drivers, handlers, and packers swarmed before his eyes, filling, the air with their oaths and cries, irritably intent upon their labour but the man in the window never looked at them, never gave any, sign that he heard them, never seemed to be aware of their existence--he just sat there and looked out, his eyes fixed in an abstracted stare.",1
3196,"The voice of forest water in the night, a woman's laughter in the dark, the clean, hard rattle of raked gravel, the cricketing stitch of midday in hot meadows, the delicate web of children's voices in bright air--these things will never change. The glitter of sunlight on roughened water, the glory of the stars, the innocence of morning, the smell of the sea in harbours, the feathery blur and smoky buddings of young boughs, and something there that comes and goes and never can be captured, the thorn of spring, the sharp and tongueless cry--these things will always be the same. All things belonging to the earth will never change--the leaf, the blade, the flower, the wind that cries and sleeps and wakes again, the trees whose stiff arms clash and tremble in the dark, and the dust of lovers long since buried in the earth--all things proceeding from the earth to seasons, all things that lapse and change and come again upon the earth--these things will always be the same, for they come up from the earth that never changes, they go back into the earth that lasts for ever. Only the earth endures, but it endures for ever.",1
3199,"He ripped off the flap and took out the message. He read it quickly, first glancing at the signature. It was from his Uncle Mark Joyner:  ""YOUR AUNT MAW DIED LAST NIGHT STOP FUNERAL THURSDAY IN LIBYA HILL STOP COME HOME IF YOU CAN.",1
3206,"By the next afternoon, when George went to Pennsylvania Station to catch his train, he had recovered from the first shock of Aunt Maw's death. The human mind is a fearful instrument of adaptation, and in nothing is this more clearly shown than in its mysterious powers of resilience, self-protection, and self-healing. Unless an event completely shatters the order of one's life, the mind, if it has youth and health and time enough, accepts the inevitable and gets itself ready for the next happening like a grimly dutiful American tourist who, on arriving at a new town, looks around him, takes his bearings, and says, ""Well, where do I go from here? So it was with George. The prospect of the funeral filled him with dread, but that was still a day off; meanwhile he had a long train ride ahead of him, and he pushed his sombre feelings into the background and allowed himself to savour freely the eager excitement which any journey by train always gave him.",1
3207,"The station, as he entered it, was murmurous with the immense and distant sound of time. Great slant beams of mottled light fell ponderously athwart the station's floor, and the calm voice of time hovered along the walls and ceiling of that mighty room, distilled out of the voices and movements of the people who swarmed beneath. It had the murmur of a distant sea, the languorous lapse and flow of waters on a beach. It was elemental, detached, indifferent to the lives of men. They contributed to it as drops of rain contribute to a river that draws its flood and movement majestically from great depths, out of purple hills at evening.",1
3215,"Here were a few of them: a homesick nigger going back to Georgia; a rich young man from an estate on the Hudson who was going to visit his mother in Washington; a district superintendent, and three of his agents, of a farm machinery company, who had been attending a convention of district leaders in the city; the president of a bank in an Old Catawba town which was tottering on the edge of ruin, who had come desperately, accompanied by two local politicians, to petition New York bankers for a loan; a Greek with tan shoes, a cardboard valise; a swarthy face, and eyes glittering with mistrust, who had peered in through the ticket seller's window, saying: ""How mucha you want to go to Pittsburgh, eh?""; an effeminate young man from one of the city universities who was going to make his weekly lecture on the arts of the theatre to a club of ladies in Trenton, New Jersey; a lady poetess from a town in Indiana who had been to New York for her yearly spree of ""bohemianism""; a prize-fighter and his manager on their way to a fight in St. Louis; some Princeton boys just back from a summer in Europe, on their way home for a short visit before returning to college; a private soldier in the United States army, with the cheap, tough, and slovenly appearance of a private soldier in the United States army; the president of a state university in the Middle West who had just made an eloquent appeal for funds to the New York alumni; a young married couple from Mississippi, with everything new--new clothes, new baggage--and a shy, hostile, and bewildered look; two little Filipinos, brown as berries and with the delicate bones of birds, dressed with the foppish perfection of manikins; women from the suburban towns of New Jersey who had come to the city to shop; women and girls from small towns in the South and West, who had come for holidays, sprees, or visits; the managers and agents of clothing stores in little towns all over the country who had come to the city to buy new styles and fashions; New Yorkers of a certain class, flashily dressed, sensual, and with a high, hard finish, knowing and assured, on their way to vacations in Atlantic City; jaded, faded, bedraggled women, scolding and jerking viciously at the puny arms of dirty children; swarthy, scowling, and dominant-looking Italian men with their dark, greasy, and flabby-looking women, sullen but submissive both to lust and beatings; and smartly-dressed American women, obedient to neither bed nor whip, who had assertive, harsh voices, bold glances, and the good figures but not the living curves, either of body or of spirit, of love, lust, tenderness, or any female fullness of the earth whatever. There were all sorts and conditions of men and travellers: poor people with the hard, sterile faces of all New Jerseys of the flesh and spirit; shabby and beaten-looking devils with cheap suitcases containing a tie, a collar, and a shirt, who had a look of having dropped for ever off of passing trains into the dirty cinders of new towns and the hope of some new fortune; the shabby floaters and drifters of the nation; suave, wealthy, and experienced people who had been too far, too often, on too many costly trains and ships, and who never looked out of windows any more; old men and women from the country on first visits to their children in the city, who looked about them constantly and suspiciously with the quick eyes of birds and animals, alert, mistrustful, and afraid. There were people who saw everything, and people who saw nothing; people who were weary, sullen, sour, and people who laughed, shouted, and were exultant with the thrill of the voyage; people who thrust and jostled, and people who stood quietly and watched and waited; people with amused, superior looks, and people who glared and bristled pugnaciously. Young, old, rich, poor, Jews, Gentiles, Negroes, Italians, Greeks, Americans--they were all there in the station, their infinitely varied destinies suddenly harmonised and given a moment of intense and sombre meaning as they were gathered into the murmurous, all-taking unity of time.",1
3217,"The moment he entered the pullman he was transported instantly from the vast allness of general humanity in the station into the familiar geography of his home town. One might have been away for years and never have seen 'an old familiar face; one might have wandered to the far ends of the earth; one might have got with child a mandrake root, or heard mermaids singing, or known the words and music of what songs the Sirens sang; one might have lived and worked alone for ages in the canyons of Manhattan until the very memory of home was lost and far as in a dream: yet the moment that he entered K19 it all came back again, his feet touched earth, and he was home. It was uncanny. And what was most wonderful and mysterious about it was that one could come here to this appointed meeting each day at thirty-five minutes after one o'clock, one could come here through the humming traffic of the city to the gigantic portals of the mighty station, one could walk through the concourse for ever swarming with its bustle of arrival and departure, one could traverse the great expanses of the station, peopled with Everybody and haunted by the voice of time--and then, down those steep stairs, there in the tunnel's depth, underneath this hive-like universe of life, waiting in its proper place, no whit different outwardly from all its other grimy brethren, was K19.",1

3232,"At the far end of the car a man stood up and started back down the aisle towards the washroom. He walked with a slight limp and leaned upon a cane, and with his free hand he held on to the backs of the seats to brace himself against the lurching of the train. As he came abreast of George, who sat there gazing out the window, the man stopped abruptly. A strong, good-natured voice, warm, easy, bantering, unafraid, unchanged--exactly as it was when it was fourteen years of age--broke like a flood of living light upon his consciousness:",1
3235,"George had seen Nebraska Crane only once in all the years since he himself had first left Libya Hill and gone away to college. But he had not lost sight of him. Nobody had lost sight of Nebraska Crane. That wiry, fearless little figure of the Cherokee boy who used to comedown the hill on Locust Street with the bat slung over his shoulder and the well-oiled fielder's mitt protruding from his hip-pocket had been prophetic of a greater destiny, for Nebraska had become a professional baseball player, he had crashed into the big leagues, and his name had been emblazoned in the papers every day.",1

Her corn-silk hair was frizzled in a halo about her face, and her chubby features were heavily accented by rouge and lipstick. But she was simple and natural in her talk and bearing, and George liked her at once. She welcomed him with a warm and friendly smile and said she had heard a lot about him.",1

He was silent for a moment, then he looked at his friend with a tolerant Cherokee grin and said: ""But I'm crackin' up, Monkus. Guess I cain't stan' the gaff much more. Nebraska was only thirty-one now, and George was incredulous.",1
3264,"It was hard and painful for him to face the fact that this strong and fearless creature, who had stood in his life always for courage and for victory, should now be speaking with such ready acceptance of defeat. But, Bras,"" he protested, ""you've been hitting just as well this season as you ever did! I've read about you in the papers, and the reporters have all said the same thing.

The crowd in the bleachers is out there roastin' in their shirt-sleeves, an' when the pitcher throws the ball it just comes from nowheres--it comes right out of all them shirt-sleeves in the bleachers. It's on top of you before you know it. Well, anyway, you dig in an' git a toe-hold, take your cut, an' maybe you connect. You straighten out a fast one. It's good fer two bases if you hustle. In the old days you could've made it standin' up. But now--boy! He shook his head slowly. You cain't tell me nothin' about that ball park in St. Looie in July!

""Bras, do you remember when you and I were kids and your father was on the police force, how he used to wrestle all those professionals that came to town?",1
3276,"There were some good ones, too!""  ""You're damn right there was!"" said the player, nodding his head.

Do you remember the night, Bras, up at the old City Auditorium, when your father was wrestling one of these Masked Marvels, and we were there in the front row rooting for him, and he got a strangle hold on this fellow with the mask, and the mask came off--and the fellow wasn't the Masked Marvel at all, but only that Greek who used to work all night at the Bijou Café for Ladies and Gents down by the depot?""  ""Yeah--haw-haw!",1
3287,"On the Square, in his ramshackle two-storey building of rusty brick, was ""the store"". It was a second-hand furniture store, and it occupied the ground floor and basement of the building. It was, of course, nothing but a blind for his illegal transactions with the negroes. A hasty and appalled inspection of the mountainous heap of ill-smelling junk which it contained would have been enough to convince one that if the owner had to depend on the sale of his stock he would have to close his doors within a month. It was incredible. In the dirty window was a pool table, taken as brutal tribute from some negro billiard parlour. But what a pool table! Surely it had not a fellow in all the relics in the land. Its surface was full of lumps and dents and ridges. Not a pocket remained without a hole in the bottom big enough to drop a baseball through. The green cloth-covering had worn through or become unfixed in a dozen places. The edges of the table and the cloth itself were seared and burnt with the marks of innumerable cigarettes. Yet this dilapidated object was by all odds the most grandiose adornment of the whole store.",1
3295,"You can't pay fifty cents a week? Still sullen, dark, and mournful, as doubtful and confused as jungle depths of Africa: ""Doan know...Seem lak a long time since Ah started payin' up----""  Harshly, cold as poison, quick as a striking snake: ""You've never started paying up. You've paid nothing. You're only paying interest, and behind in that.",1
3297,"All right, Carrie: here's your receipt. You bring that extra dollar in next week. Others, a little more intelligent than Carrie, would comprehend more dearly what had happened to them, but would continue to pay because they were unable to get together at one time enough money to release them from their bondage.",1
3298,"A few would have energy and power enough to save their pennies until at last they were able to buy back their freedom. Still others, after paying week by week and month by month, would just give up in despair and would pay no more. Then, of course, Clyde Beals was on them like a vulture. He nagged, he wheedled, and he threatened; and if, finally, he saw that he could get no more money from them, he took their household furniture. Hence the chaotic pile of malodorous junk which filled the shop.",1
3300,"Moreover, Judge Rumford Bland knew that the people with whom he dealt would not inform on him. He knew that the negro stood in awe of the complex mystery of the law, of which he understood little or nothing, or in terror of its brutal force. The law for him was largely a matter of the police, and the police was a white man in a uniform, who had the power and authority to arrest him, to beat him with his fist or with a club, to shoot him with a gun, and to lock him up in a small, dark cell. It was not likely, therefore, that any negro would take his troubles to the police. He was not aware that he had any rights as a citizen, and that Judge Rumford Bland had violated those rights; or, if he was aware of rights, however vaguely, he was not likely to ask for their protection by a group of men at whose hands he had known only assault, arrest, and imprisonment.",1
3302,"Within, the front room was furnished with such lumber as lawyers use. The floor was bare, there were two roll-top desks, black with age, two bookcases with glass doors, filled with battered volumes of old pigskin brown, a spittoon, brass-bodied and capacious, swimming with tobacco juice, a couple of ancient swivel chairs, and a few other nondescript straight-backed chairs for visitors to sit and creak in. On the walls were several faded diplomas--Pine Rock College, Bachelor of Arts; The University of Old Catawba, Doctor of Laws; and a certificate of The Old Catawba Bar Association. Behind was another room with nothing in it but some more bookcases full of heavy tomes in musty calf bindings, a few chairs, and against the wall a plush sofa--the room, it was whispered, ""where Bland took his women"". Out front, in the windows that looked on the Square, their glass unwashed and specked with the ghosts of flies that died when Gettysburg was young, were two old, frayed, mottled-yellow window shades, themselves as old as Garfield, and still faintly marked with the distinguished names of ""Kennedy and Bland"". The Kennedy of that old law firm had been the father of Baxter Kennedy, the Mayor, and his partner, old General Bland, had been Rumford's father. Both bad been dead for years, but no one had bothered to change the lettering.",1
3306,"In his early manhood Judge Bland had married a beautiful but dissolute woman, whom he shortly divorced. The utter cynicism that marked his attitude towards women was perhaps partly traceable to this source. Ever since his divorce he had lived alone with his mother, a stately, white-haired lady to whom he rendered at all times a faithful, solicitous, exquisitely kind and gentle duty. Some people suspected that this filial devotion was tinged with irony and contemptuous resignation, but certainly the old lady herself had no cause to think so. She occupied a pleasant old house, surrounded with every comfort, and if she ever guessed by what dark means her luxuries had been assured, she never spoke of it to her son. As for women generally, Judge Bland divided them brutally into two groups--the mothers and the prostitutes--and, aside from the single exception in his own home, his sole interest was in the second division.",1
3313,"He talked to him persuasively, in friendly wise, urging him to invest his savings in the real estate speculations of the town. He brought up all his heaviest artillery of logic and mathematics, drawing forth his pencil and note-book to figure out just how much a given sum of money could be increased if it was shrewdly invested now in this or that piece of property, and then sold when the time was right. You can't go wrong!"" said Jarvis Riggs, a little feverishly. The town is bound to grow. Why, Libya Hill is only at the beginning of its development. You bring your money back home, my boy, and let it go to work for you! You'll see!""  This went on for some time.",1
3315,"He was completely detached from the fever of the times--from the fever of the boom-mad town as well as from the larger fever of the nation. The others talked incessantly about land, but George saw that Nebraska Crane was the only one who still conceived of the land as a place on which to live, and of living on the land as a way of life. At last Nebraska detached himself from the group and said he was going back to take a smoke. George started to follow him. As he passed down the aisle behind his friend and came abreast of the last seat, suddenly a quiet, toneless voice said:  ""Good evening, Webber.",1
3316,"He stopped and spun round. The blind man was seated there before him. He had almost forgotten about him. The blind man had not moved as he spoke. He was still leaning a little forward on his cane, his thin, white face held straight before him as if he were still listening for something. George felt now, as he had always felt, the strange fascination in that evil shadow of a smile that hovered about the corners of the blind man's mouth. He paused, then said:  ""Judge Bland.",1
3318,"The other men stopped talking and turned as if they had received an electric shock. George did not know what to say; in the embarrassment of the moment he blurted out:  ""I--I--there are a lot of people on the train from home. I--I've been talking to them--Mayor Kennedy, and----""  The blind man, never moving, in his terrible toneless voice that carried to all ears, broke in:",1
3320,"The group in the middle looked at one another with fear in their eyes, and in a moment they began 'talking feverishly again. I hear you were in France again last year,"" the voice now said. And did you find the French whores any different from the homegrown variety? The naked words, with their toneless evil, pierced through the car like a flash of sheer terror.",1
3325,"But you don't mean that you----""  ""Oh, utterly! Utterly!"" replied Judge Bland, and all at once he threw his sightless face up and laughed with sardonic glee, displaying blackened rims of teeth, as if the joke was too good to be kept. My dear boy, I assure you that I am utterly blind. I can no longer distinguish one of our most prominent local bastards two feet off--Now, Jarvis! he suddenly cried out in a chiding voice in the direction of the unfortunate Riggs, who had loudly resumed his discussion of property values--""you know that's not true! Why, man, I can tell by the look in your eyes that you're lying! And again he lifted his face and was shaken by devilish, quiet laughter. Excuse the interruption, son,"" he went on. I believe the subject of our discourse was bastardy. Why, can you believe it?""--he leaned forward again his long fingers playing gently on the polished ridges of his stick--""where bastardy is concerned, I find I can no longer trust my eyes at all. I rely exclusively on the sense of smell. And""--for the first time his face was sunken deliberately in weariness and disgust--""it is enough. A sense of smell is all you need. Abruptly changing now, he said: ""How are the folks? Why--Aunt Maw's dead.",1
3330,"Look here, Judge Bland--in the name of God, what have I done? He thought desperately of a dozen wild, fantastic things, feeling a sickening and overwhelming consciousness of guilt, without knowing why. He thought: ""Has he heard about my book? Does he know I wrote about the town? Is that what he means?""  The blind man cackled thinly to himself, enjoying with evil tenderness his little cat's play with the young man: ""The guilty fleeth where no man pursueth.",1
3331,"Is that it, son?""  Frankly distracted: ""Why--why--I'm not guilty! Angrily: ""Why damn it, I'm not guilty of anything! Passionately, excitedly: ""I can hold up my head with any man! I can look the whole damn world in the eye! I make no apologies to----""  He stopped short, seeing the evil ghost-shadow of a smile at the corners of the blind man's mouth.",1
3337,"As George went into the washroom suddenly, be came upon the Mayor cleaning his false teeth in the basin. The man's plump face, which George had always known in the guise of cheerful, hearty amiability, was all caved in. Hearing a sound behind him, the Mayor turned upon the newcomer. For a moment there was nothing but nameless fright in his weak brown eyes. He mumbled frantically, incoherently, holding his false teeth in his trembling fingers. Like a man who did not know what he was doing, he brandished them in a grotesque yet terrible gesture indicative of--God knows what!--but despair and terror were both in it. Then he put the teeth into his mouth again, smiled feebly, and muttered apologetically, with some counterfeit of his usual geniality:  ""Ho, ho!--well, son!",1
3342,"When the laughter and the slapping of thighs subsided, Parson Flack leaned forward again, eager to tell another. In a voice that was subdued, confidential, almost conspiratorial, he began:  ""And do you remember the time that he----?""  Swiftly the curtain was drawn aside, all heads jerked up, and Judge Bland entered. Now, Parson""--said he in a chiding voice--""remember what? Before the blind, cold stare of that emaciated face the seated men were silent. Something stronger than fear was in their eyes.",1
3344,"He paused impressively, like a country lawyer getting ready to launch his peroration to a jury. Remember what?""--the voice rose suddenly, high and sharp. Do I remember, Parson, how you've run the town through all these years? Do I remember what a good thing you've made of politics? You've never aspired to public office, have you, Parson? Oh, no--you're much too modest. But you know how to pick the public-spirited citizens who do aspire, and whose great hearts pant with eagerness to serve their fellow men! Ah, yes. It's a very nice little private business, isn't it, Parson? And all 'the boys' are stockholders and get their cut of the profits--is that the way of it, Parson?...Remember what?"" he cried again. Do I remember now the broken fragments of a town that waits and fears and schemes to put off the day of its impending ruin? Why, Parson, yes--I can remember all these things. And yet I had no part in them, for, after all, I am a humble man. Oh""--with a deprecating nod--"" a little nigger squeezing here and there, a little income out of Niggertown, a few illegal lendings, a comfortable practice in small usury--yet my wants were few, my tastes were very simple. I was always satisfied with, say, a modest five per cent a week. So I am not in the big money, Parson. I remember many things, but I see now I have spent my substance, wasted all my talents in riotous living--while pious Puritans have virtuously betrayed their town and given their whole-souled services to the ruin of their fellow men. Again there was an ominous pause, and when he went on his voice was low, almost casual in its toneless irony:  ""I am afraid I have been at best a giddy fellow, Parson, and that my old age will be spent in memories of trivial things--of various merry widows who came to town, of poker chips, racehorses, cards, and rattling dice, of bourbon, Scotch, and rye--all the forms of hellishness that saintly fellows, Parson, who go to prayer-meeting every week, know nothing of.",1
3349,"He thought of all his years away from home, the years of wandering in many lands and cities. He remembered how many times he had thought of home with such an intensity of passion that he could close his eyes and see the scheme of every street, and every house upon each street, and the faces of the people, as well as recall the countless things that they had said and the densely-woven fabric of all their histories. To-morrow he would see it all again, and he almost wished he had not come. It would have been easy to plead the excuse of work and other duty. And it was silly, anyhow, to feel as he did about the place.",1
3355,"The inevitable argument, vehement, good-natured, and protesting, began immediately, and in another moment Randy was in triumphant possession and the two were walking together towards the platform, Randy saying scornfully all the time in answer to the other's protests: Oh, for God's sake, forget about it! I'll let you do as much for me when I come up to the Big Town to visit you!... Here's Margaret! he said as they reached the platform. I know she'll be glad to see you!",1
3356,"She was waiting for him with a broad smile on her homely face. They had grown up together as next-door neighbours, and were almost like brother and sister. As a matter of fact, when George had been ten and Margaret twelve, they had had one of those idyllic romances of childhood in which each pledged eternal devotion to the other and took it for granted that they would marry when they grew up. But the years had changed all that. He had gone away, and she had taken charge of Randy when her parents died; she now kept house for him, and had never married. As he saw her standing there with the warm smile on her face, and with something vaguely spinsterish in her look in spite of her large, full-breasted figure and her general air of hearty good nature, he felt a sudden stirring of pity and old affection for her.",1
3358,"Then, blushing with pleasure, she stepped back a pace and regarded him with the half bantering expression she had used so often as a child. Well, well, well! she said. You haven't changed much, George! A little stouter, maybe, but I reckon I'd have known you!""  They spoke now quietly about Aunt Maw and about the funeral, saying the strained and awkward things that people always say when they talk of death.",1
3359,"Then, this duty done, there was a little pause before they resumed their natural selves once more. The two men looked at each other and grinned. When they had been boys together Randy had seemed to George more like Mercutio than anybody he had ever known. He had had a small, lean head, well shaped, set closely with blond hair; he had been quick as a flash, light, wiry, active, with a wonderful natural grace in everything he did; his mind and spirit had been cleat, exuberant, incisive, tempered like a fine Toledo blade. In college, too, he had been the same: he had not only done well in his classes, but had distinguished himself as a swimmer and as quarter-back on the football team.",1
3365,"he yelled again. Then, more soberly, but still grinning: ""I guess we'll have to sleep you out over the garage, Monk, old boy. Dave Merrit's in town, and he's got the spare room. There was a slight note of deference in his voice as he mentioned Merrit's name, but he went on lightly: ""Or if you like--haw-w!--there's a nice room at Mrs. Charles Montgomery Hopper's, and she'd be glad to have you!""  George looked rather uncomfortable at the mention of Mrs. Charles Montgomery Hopper.",1
3367,"I think the garage is swell. And besides""--they all grinned at each other again with the affection of people who know each other so well that they are long past knowledge--""if I get to helling around at night, I won't feel that I'm disturbing you when I come in... But who is Mr. Merrit, anyway?""  ""Why,"" Randy answered, and now he had an air of measuring his words with thoughtful deliberation, ""he--he's the Company's man--my boss, you know.",1
3370,"And I know he wants to see you... Well,"" he said, and the preoccupied look was in his eyes again, ""if we're all ready, let's get going. I'm due back at the office now. Merrit's there, of course. Suppose I run you out to the house and drop you, then I'll see you later. This was agreed upon.",1
3373,"In the tiny front room, where on wintry nights Aunt Maw had always sat by the light of a kerosene lamp before a flickering fire, telling the boy her endless stories of death and sorrow, she now lay in her black coffin, the top and front of which were open to display as much of her as possible to the general view. And instantly, as George entered, he knew that one of her main obsessions in life had been victorious over death. A spinster and a virgin all her years, she had always had a horrible fear that, somehow, some day, some man would see her body. As she grew older her thoughts had been more and more preoccupied with death, and with her morbid shame lest someone see her in the state of nature after she was dead. For this reason she had a horror of undertakers, and had made her brother, Mark, and his wife, Mag, solemnly promise that no man would see her unclothed corpse, that her laying out would be done by women, and, above all else, that she was not to be embalmed. By now she had been dead three days--three days of long hot sun and sultriness--and it seemed to George a grim but fitting ending that the last memory he would have of that little house, which in his childhood had been so filled with the stench of death-in-life, should now be the stench of death itself.",1
3375,"The minister, with the unconscious callousness of self-righteousness, rehearsed again the story of the family scandal. He told how George Webber's father had abandoned his wife, Amelia Joyner, to live in open shame with another woman, and how Amelia had shortly, afterwards ""died of a broken heart"". He told how ""Brother Mark Joyner and his God-fearing wife, Sister Maggie Joyner,"" had been filled with righteous wrath and had gone to court and wrested the motherless boy from the sinful keeping of his father; and how ""this good woman who now lies dead before us"" had taken charge of her sister's son and brought him up in a Christian home. And he said be was glad to see that the young man who had been the recipient of this dutiful charity had come home again to pay his last debt of gratitude at the bier of the one to whom he owed so much.",1
3380,"For a little while Mrs. Flood sat in contemplative silence. But as the procession moved off and slowly made its way through the streets of the town, she began to glance sharply out of the windows on both sides, and before long, without any preliminary, she launched forth in a commentary on the history of every piece of property they passed. It was constant, panoramic, and exhaustive. She talked incessantly, gesturing briefly and casually with her hand, only pausing from time to time to nod deliberately to herself in a movement of strong affirmation.",1
3384,"Hah? What's that? she cried out in a sharply startled tone. What does it say there?""  They all craned their necks to see it as they passed, and George read aloud the legend on the sign:  RIVERCREST DEDICATED TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF THIS SECTION AND TO THE GLORY OF THE GREATER CITY THEY WILL BUILD Mrs. Flood took in the words with obvious satisfaction.",1
3386,"she muttered scornfully--then, with mincing refinement: ""Now ain't that nice? Dedicated to cutting your throat and bleeding you white of every nickel that you've got! They were now entering the cemetery, and the procession wound slowly in along a circling road and at length came to a halt near the rounded crest of the hill below the Joyner burial plot. At one corner of the plot a tall locust tree was growing, and beneath its shade all the Joyners had been buried. There was the family monument--a square, massive chunk of grey, metallic granite, brilliantly burnished, with ""JOYNER"" in raised letters upon its shining surface. On the ends were inscriptions for old Lafayette and his wife, with their names and dates; and, grouped about them, in parallel rows set on the gentle slope, were the graves of Lafayette's children. All these had smaller individual monuments, and on each of these, below the name and dates of birth and death, was some little elegiac poem carved in a Bowing script.",1
3387,"At one side of the burial plot the new-dug grave gaped darkly in the raw earth, and beside it was a mound of loose yellow clay. Ranged above it on the hill were several rows of folding chairs. Towards these the people, who were now getting out of the cars, began to move.  Mark and Mag and various other Joyners took the front rows, and George and Margaret, with Mrs. Flood still close beside them, found chairs at the back.",1
3393,"The people had now begun to move away and to walk back slowly towards their cars. The Joyners, however, kept their seats until the last spadeful of earth was heaped and patted into place. Then they arose, their duty done. Some of them just stood there now, talking quietly in their drawling voices, while others sauntered among the tombstones, bending over to read the inscriptions and straightening up to recall and tell each other some forgotten incident in the life of some forgotten Joyner. At last they, too, began to drift away.",1
3394,"George did not want to go back with them and be forced to hear the shreds of Aunt Maw's life torn apart and pieced together again, so he linked his arm through Margaret's and led her over the brow of the hill to the other side. For a little while they stood in the slanting light, silent, their faces to the west, and watched the great ball of the sun sink down behind the rim of distant mountains. And the majestic beauty of the spectacle, together with the woman's quiet presence there beside him, brought calm and peace to the young man's troubled spirit.",1
3398,"He bent forward and read again the familiar inscription:  Amelia Webber, née Joyner and below her dates the carved verse:  Still is the voice we knew so well, Vanished the face we love, Flown her spirit pure to dwell With angels up above. Ours is the sorrow, ours the pain, And ours the joy alone To clasp her in our arms again In Heaven, by God's throne. That's the thing that started all this movin'! Mrs. Flood was saying. Nobody'd ever have thought of comin' here if it hadn't been for Amelia! And here,"" she cried fretfully, ""the woman had been dead and in her grave more than a year when he gets this notion in his head he's got to move her--and you couldn't reason with him! Why, your uncle, Mark Joyner--that's who it was! You couldn't argue with him! she cried with vehement surprise. Why, yes, of course! It was back there at the time they were havin' all that trouble with your father, child. He'd left Amelia and gone to live with that other woman--but I will say this for him! and she nodded her head with determination. When Amelia died, John Webber did the decent thing and buried her himself--claimed her as his wife and buried her! He'd bought a plot in the old cemetery, and that's where he put her. But then, more than a year afterwards--you know, child--when Mark Joyner had that trouble with your father about who was to bring you up--yes, and took it to the courts and won!--why, that's when it was that Mark took it in his head to move Amelia. Said he wouldn't let a sister of his lie in Webber earth! He already had this plot, of course, way over here on this hill where nobody'd ever thought of goin'. It was just a little private buryin' ground, then--a few families used it, that was all. She paused and looked out thoughtfully over the town, then after a moment she went on:  ""Your Aunt Maw, she tried to talk to Mark about it, but it was like talkin' to a stone wall.",1
3402,"Come, now! she cried briskly and cheerfully. It's time we were goin' home! It's gettin' dark!",1
3403,"The three of them walked in silence down the slope towards the waiting car. As they came up to it and were about to get in, Mrs. Flood stopped and laid her hand on George's shoulder in a warm and easy gesture. Young man,"" she said, ""I've been a long time livin' on this earth, and as the fellow says, the world do move! You've got your life ahead of you, and lots to learn and many things to do--but let me tell you somethin', boy! and all at once she looked at him in a straight and deadly fashion. Go out and see the world and get your fill of wanderin',"" she cried, ""and then come back and tell me if you've found a better place than home! I've seen great changes in my time, and I'll see more before I die. There are great things yet in store for us--great progress, great inventions--it will all come true. Perhaps I'll not live to see it, but you will! We've got a fine town here, and fine people to make it go--and we're not done yet. I've seen it all grow up out of a country village--and some day we will have a great city here. She waited an instant as if she expected him to answer and corroborate her judgment, and when he merely nodded to show that he had heard her, she took it for agreement and went on:  ""Your Aunt Maw always hoped that you'd come home again.",1
3412,"George could remember its wide porches and comfortable rockers, its innumerable eaves and gables, its labyrinth of wings and corridors, its great parlours and their thick red carpets, and the lobby with its old red leather chairs, hollowed and shaped by the backs of men, and its smell of tobacco and its iced tinkle of tall drinks. It had a splendid dining-room filled with laughter and quiet voices, where expert negroes in white jackets bent and scraped and chuckled over the jokes of the rich men from the North as with prayerful grace they served them delicious foods out of old silver dishes. George could remember, too, the smiles and the tender beauty of the rich men's wives and daughters. As a boy he had been touched with the unutterable mystery of all these things, for these wealthy travellers had come great distances and had somehow brought with them an evocation of the whole golden and unvisited world, with its fabulous cities and its promise of glory, fame, and love.",1
3419,"On time...God! Crazy, crazy, crazy,"" he kept laughing and shaking his head. That's the way they make it. Are you making it, too?""  At once his manner became feverishly earnest: ""Why, it's the damnedest thing you ever heard of!",1
3424,"What's the sense in keeping it?... Now's the time when things are at the peak. He'll never get a better offer! I know, but he's expecting to strike oil out in the backyard any time now,"" said George with a laugh.",1
3425,"At this moment there was a disturbance among the tides of traffic in the street. A magnificent car detached itself from the stream of humbler vehicles and moved in swiftly to the kerb, where it came to a smooth stop--a glitter of nickel, glass, and burnished steel. From it a gaudily attired creature stepped down to the pavement with an air of princely indolence, tucked a light Malacca cane carelessly under its right armpit, and slowly and fastidiously withdrew from its nicotined fingers a pair of lemon-coloured gloves, at the same time saying to the liveried chauffeur:  ""You may go, James.",1
3426,"Call for me again in hal-luf an houah! The creature's face was thin and sunken. Its complexion was a deathly sallow--all except the nose, which was bulbous and glowed a brilliant red, showing an intricate network of enlarged purple veins. Its toothless jaws were equipped with such an enormous set of glittering false teeth that the lips could not cover them, and they grinned at the world with the prognathous bleakness of a skeleton. The whole figure, although heavy and shambling, had the tottering appearance which suggested a stupendous debauchery. It moved forward with its false, bleak grin, leaning heavily upon the stick, and suddenly George recognised that native ruin which had been known to him since childhood as Tim Wagner.",1
3427,"J. Timothy Wagner--the ""J"" was a recent and completely arbitrary addition of his own, appropriated, no doubt, to fit his ideas of personal grandeur, and to match the eminent position in the town's affairs to which he had belatedly risen--was the black sheep of one of the old, established families in the community. At the time George Webber was a boy, Tim Wagner had been for so long the product of complete disillusion that there was no longer any vestige of respect attached to him. He had been pre-eminently the town sot. His title to this office was unquestioned. In this capacity he was even held in a kind of affection. His exploits were notorious, the subjects of a hundred stories. One night, for example, the loafers in McCormack's pharmacy had seen Tim swallow something and then shudder convulsively. This process was repeated several times, until the curiosity of the loafers was aroused. They began to observe him furtively but closely, and in a few minutes Tim thrust out his hand slyly, fumbled round in the gold-fish bowl, and withdrew his hand with a wriggling little shape between his fingers. Then the quick swallow and the convulsive shudder were repeated.",1
3434,"During this period of his life some canvassers at a local election, had looked for Tim to enrol him in the interest of their candidate, but they had been unable to find out where he lived. He had not; lived, of course, with any member of his family for years, and investigation failed to disclose that he had a room anywhere. The question then began to go round: ""Where does Tim Wagner live? Where does he sleep? No one could find out. And Tim's own answers, when pressed for information, were slyly evasive.",1
3435,"One day, however, the answer came to light. The motor-car had come, and come so thoroughly that people were even getting buried by motor-car. The day of the horse-drawn hearse had passed for ever. Accordingly, one of the local undertaking firms had told Tim he could have their old horse-drawn hearse if he would only take it off their premises. Tim had accepted the macabre gift and had parked the hearse in his lot. One day when Tim was absent the canvassers came back again, still persistent in their efforts to learn his address so they could enrol him. They noticed the old hearse, and, seeing that its raven curtains were so closely drawn that the interior was hidden from view, they decided to investigate. Cautiously they opened the doors of the hearse. A cot was inside. There was even a chair. It was completely furnished as a small but adequate bedroom.",1
3439,"George watched the scene with amazement. Tim Wagner, still drawing the gloves off of his fingers with an expression of bored casualness, walked slowly over towards the entrance of McCormack's drug-store--no longer were his steps short and quick, for he leaned heavily on his cane--while Sam, in an attitude of obsequious entreaty, kept at his elbow, bending his tall form towards him and hoarsely pouring out a torrent of questions:  ""...Property in West Libya...Seventy-five thousand dollars... Option expires to-morrow at noon... Joe Ingram has the piece above mine...Won't sell... Holding for hundred fifty... Mine's the best location... But Fred Bynum says too far from main road... What do you think, Tim?... Is it worth it?""  During the course of this torrential appeal Tim Wagner did not even turn to look at his petitioner.",1
3440,"He gave no evidence whatever that he heard what Sam was saying. Instead, he stopped, thrust his gloves into his pocket, cast, his eyes round slyly in a series of quick glances, and suddenly began to root into himself violently with a clutching hand. Then he straightened up like a man just coming out of a trance, and seemed to become aware for the first time that Sam was waiting.",1
3441,"What's that? What did you say, Sam?"" he said rapidly. How much did they offer you for it? Don't sell, don't sell! he said suddenly and with great emphasis. Now's the time to buy, not to sell. The trend is upwards. Buy! Buy! Don't take it. Don't sell. That's my advice!""  ""I'm not selling, Tim,"" Sam cried excitedly.",1
3444,"Tim cried sharply. West Libya? Why didn't you say so? That's different. Buy! Buy! Can't go wrong! Whole town's moving in that direction. Values double out there in six months. How much do they want? Seventy-five thousand,"" Sam panted.",1
3447,"Sam glanced wildly about him, passed his hand nervously through his hair several times, and then said, sighing heavily and shaking his head in wonder:  ""Seventy-five thousand dollars' profit in one deal!...Never heard anything like it in my...life! Lord, Lord! he cried. What are we coming to? Somehow the news had got round that George had written a book and that it would soon be published.",1
3448,"The editor of the local paper heard of it and sent a reporter to interview him, and printed a story about it. So you've written a book?"" said the reporter. What kind of a book is it? What's it about?""  ""Why--I--I hardly know how to tell you,"" George stammered.",1
3450,"We understand you have travelled a great deal since you left home. Been to Europe several times?""  ""Yes, I have. In your opinion, how does this section of the country compare with other places you have seen?""  ""Why--why--er--why good!...",1
3451,"I mean, fine! That is----""  LOCAL PARADISE COMPARES FAVOURABLY In answer to the reporter's question as to how this part of the country compared to other places he had seen, the former Libya man declared:  ""There is no place I have ever visited--and my travels have taken me to England, Germany, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, to say nothing of the south of France, the Italian Riviera, and the Swiss Alps--which can compare in beauty with the setting of my native town.",1
3452,"We have here,"" he said enthusiastically, ""a veritable Paradise of Nature. Air, climate, scenery, water, natural beauty, all conspire to make this section the most ideal place in the whole world to live. Did you ever think of coming back here to live?",1
3458,"He sat down and wrote a scathing letter to the paper, but when he had finished he tore it up. After all, what good would it do? The reporter had spun his story out of nothing more substantial than his victim's friendly tones and gestures, a few words and phrases which he had blurted out in his confusion, and, above all, his reticence to talk about his work; yet the fellow had obviously been so steeped in the booster spirit that he had been able to concoct this elaborate fantasy--probably without quite knowing that it was a fantasy.",1
3465,"Not that he did not have his apprehensions. He knew what he had written about the people and the life of his home town. He knew, too, that he had written about them with a nakedness and directness which, up to that time, had been rare in American fiction. He wondered how they would take it. Even when people congratulated him about the book he could not altogether escape a feeling of uneasiness, for he was afraid of what they would say and think after the book came out and they had read it.",1
3469,"He walked on through the old familiar streets, past houses and places that lived again for him as if he had never left them, and by people who grew still and waited until he had gone, and the knowledge of wordless guilt was rooted in his soul. He knew that he was obliterated from their lives more completely than if he had died, and he felt that he was now lost to all men. Presently he had left the town, and was again upon the blasted heath, and he was fleeing across it beneath the pitiless sky where flamed the naked eye that pierced him with its unutterable weight of shame.",1
3470,"8. The Company George considered himself lucky to have the little room over the Shepperton garage. He was also glad that his visit had overlapped that of Mr. David Merrit, and that Mr. Merrit had been allowed to enjoy undisturbed the greater comfort of the Shepperton guest room, for Mr. Merrit had filled him with a pleasant glow at their first meeting. He was a ruddy, plump, well-kept man of forty-five or so, always ready with a joke and immensely agreeable, with pockets bulging with savoury cigars which he handed out to people on the slightest provocation. Randy had spoken of him as ""the Company's man,"" and, although George did not know what the duties of a ""Company's man"" were, Mr. Merrit made them seem very pleasant.",1
3473,"Mr. Merrit was not only a nice fellow. He was also ""with the Company"", and George soon realised that ""the Company"" was a vital and mysterious force in all their lives. Randy had gone with it as soon as he left college. He had been sent to the main office, up North somewhere, and had been put through a course of training. Then he had come back South and had worked his way up from salesman to district agent--an important member of the sales organisation.",1
3481,"My friends,"" he said, ""the possibilities of the market, now that we see how to create it, are practically unlimited! Here he was silent for a moment, and Mr. Merrit said that the Great Man actually paled and seemed to stagger as he tried to speak, and that his voice faltered and sank to an almost inaudible whisper, as if he himself could hardly comprehend the magnitude of his own conception. My friends""--he muttered thickly, and was seen to clutch the rostrum for support--""my friends--seen properly""--he whispered, and moistened his dry lips--""seen properly--the market we shall create being what it is""--his voice grew stronger, and the clarion words now rang forth--""there is no reason why one of our machines should not be in the possession of every man, woman, and child in the United\ States! Then came the grand, familiar gesture to the map: ""There's your market, boys! Go out and sell them!",1
3486,"While it was quite true that membership in the Hundred Club was not compulsory, it was also true that Mr. Paul S. Appleton, III, was a theologian who, like Calvin, knew how to combine free will and predestination. If one did not belong to the Hundred Club, the time was not far distant when one would not belong to Mr. Appleton. Not to belong to it was, for agent or salesman, the equivalent of living on the other side of the railroad tracks. If one failed of admission to the Company Heaven, or if one dropped out, his fellows would begin to ask guardedly: ""Where's Joe Klutz these days? The answers would be vague, and in the course of time Joe Klutz would be spoken of no more. He would fade into oblivion. He was ""no longer with the Company"".",1
3491,"As George waited, gradually he became aware of mysterious sounds emanating from beyond the partition. First there was the rustle of heavy paper, as if the pages of a ledger were being turned, and occasionally there would be a quick murmur of hushed voices, confidential, ominous, interspersed with grunts and half-suppressed exclamations. Then all at once there were two loud bangs, as of a large ledger being slammed shut and thrown upon a desk or table, and after a moment's silence the voices rose louder, distinct, plainly audible. Instantly he recognised Randy's voice--low, grave, hesitant, and deeply troubled. The other voice he had never heard before.",1
3500,"He gave George a hearty slap on the back and turned away with an air of jaunty readiness, picked up his hat, and said cheerfully: Well, what d'ya say, folks? What about one of Margaret's famous meals, out at the old homestead? Well, you can't hurt my feelings. I'm ready if you are. Let's go!",1
3503,"For as Randy spoke, and George remembered all that Merrit had told him about the Company, a terrific picture flashed through his, mind. It was a picture he had seen in a gallery somewhere, portraying a long line of men stretching from the Great Pyramid to the very portals of great Pharaoh's house, and great Pharaoh stood with a thonged whip in his hand and applied it unmercifully to the bare back and shoulders of the man in front of him, who was great Pharaoh's chief overseer, and in the hand of the overseer was a whip of many tails which he unstintedly applied to the quivering back of the wretch before him, who was the chief overseer's chief lieutenant, and in the lieutenant's hand a whip of rawhide which he laid vigourously on the quailing body of his head sergeant, and in the sergeant's hand a wicked flail with which he belaboured a whole company of groaning corporals, and in the hands of every corporal a knotted lash with which to whack a whole regiment of slaves, who pulled and hauled and bore burdens and toiled and sweated and built the towering structure of the pyramid. So George didn't say anything. He couldn't. He had just found out something about life that he had not known before.",1
3505,"As he laid the flowers on the damp, raw earth, suddenly it struck him as strange that he should be doing it. He was not a sentimental person, and for a moment it puzzled him that he should be making this gesture. He hadn't planned to do it. He had simply seen the florist's window as they drove along and, without thinking, had stopped and got the flowers, and now there they were.",1
3509,"But he spoke at length about the town itself, telling her all that he had seen of its speculative madness, and how it had impressed him. What did the future hold for that place and its people? They were always talking of the better life that lay ahead of them and of the greater city they would build, but to George it seemed that in all such talk there was evidence of a strange and savage hunger that drove them on, and that there was a desperate quality in it, as though what they really hungered for was ruin and death. It seemed to him that they were ruined, and that even when they laughed and shouted and smote each other on the back, the knowledge of their ruin was in them.",1
3512,"And when they had exhausted all their possibilities of ruin and extravagance that the town could offer, they had rushed out into the wilderness, into the lyrical immensities of wild earth where there was land enough for all men living, and they had staked off little plots and wedges in the hills as one might try to stake a picket fence out in the middle of the ocean. They had given fancy names to all these foolish enterprises--""Wild Boulders""--""Shady Acres""--""Eagle's Crest"". They had set prices on these sites of forest, field, and tangled undergrowth that might have bought a mountain, and made charts and drawings showing populous communities of shops, houses, streets, roads, and clubs in regions where there was no road, no street, no house, and which could not be reached in any way save by a band of resolute pioneers armed with axes. These places were to be transformed into idyllic colonies for artists and writers and critics; and there were colonies as well for preachers, doctors, actors, dancers, golf players, and retired locomotive engineers. There were colonies for everyone, and, what is more, they sold the lots--to one another!",1
3519,"An old and tragic light was shining faintly on the time-enchanted hills. George thought of Mrs. Delia Flood, and what she had said of Aunt Maw's hope that some day he'd come home again to stay.. And as he stood there with Margaret quietly by his side the old and tragic light of fading day shone faintly on their faces, and all at once it seemed to him that they were fixed there like a prophecy with the hills and river all round them, and that there was something lost, intolerable, foretold and come to pass, something like old time and destiny--some magic that he could not say.",1
3523,"He refused. He told her he had his work to do. He said he had his world and she had hers, and the two could never be the same. He reminded her of their compromise. He repeated that he did not want to belong to her world, that he had seen enough of it already, and that if she insisted on trying to absorb him in her life she was going to destroy the foundation on which their whole relationship had rested since he had come back to her.",1
3526,"Later, as George looked back upon it, the date took on an ominous significance, for the brilliant party was staged exactly a week before the thunderous crash in the Stock Market which marked the end of an era.  10. Jack at Morn At seven twenty-eight Mr. Frederic Jack awoke and began to come alive with all his might. He sat up and yawned strongly, stretching his arms and at the same time bending his slumber-swollen face into the plump muscle-hammock of his right shoulder, a movement coy and cuddlesome. Eee-a-a-a-ach! He stretched deliciously out of thick, rubbery sleep, and for a moment he sat heavily upright rubbing at his eyes with the clenched backs of his fingers. Then he flung off the covers with one determined motion and swung to the floor. His toes groped blindly in soft grey carpet stuff, smooth as felt, for his heelless slippers of red Russian leather. These found and slipped into, he padded noiselessly across the carpet to the window and stood, yawning and stretching again, as he looked out with sleepy satisfaction at a fine, crisp morning. Instantly he knew that it was October 17th, 1929, and the day of the party. Mr. Jack liked parties. Nine floors below him the cross street lay gulched in steep morning shadow, bluish, barren, cleanly ready for the day. A truck roared past with a solid rattling heaviness. An ash-can was banged on the pavement with an abrupt slamming racket. Upon the pavement a little figure of a man, foreshortened from above and covered by its drab cone of grey, bobbed swiftly along, turned the corner into Park Avenue, and was gone, heading southward towards work.",1
3530,"Another man, looking out upon the city in its early-morning nakedness, might have thought its forms inhuman, monstrous, and Assyrian in their insolence. But not Mr. Frederick Jack. Indeed, if all those towers had been the monuments of his own special triumph, his pride and confidence and sense of ownership could hardly have been greater than they were. My city,"" he thought. Mine. It filled his heart with certitude and joy because he had learned, like many other men, to see, to marvel, to accept, and not to ask disturbing questions. In that arrogant boast of steel and stone he saw a permanence surviving every danger, an answer, crushing and conclusive, to every doubt.",1
3541,"For breakfast he would have orange juice, two leghorn eggs, soft boiled, two slices of crisp, thin toast, and tasty little segments of pink Praguer ham, which looked so pretty on fresh parsley sprigs. And he would have coffee, strong coffee, cup after cup of it. So fortified, he would face the world with cheerful strength, ready for whatever chance the day might bring him.",1
3542,"The smell of earth which he had caught in the air this morning was good, and the remembrance of it laid a soothing unction on his soul. Although city-bred, Mr. Jack was as sensitive to the charms of Mother Earth as any man alive. He liked the cultivated forms of nature--the swarded lawns of great estates, gay regiments of brilliant garden flowers, and rich masses of clumped shrubbery. All these things delighted him. The call of the simple life had grown stronger every year, and he had built a big country house in Westchester County.",1
3543,"He liked the more expensive forms of sport. He would frequently go out in the country to play golf, and he loved bright sunlight on the rich velvet of the greens and the new-mown smell of fairways. And afterwards, when he had stood below the bracing drive of the shower and had felt the sweat of competition wash cleanly from his well-set form, he liked to loaf upon the cool veranda of the club and talk about his score, joke and laugh, pay or collect his bets, and drink good Scotch with other men of note. And he liked to watch his country's flag flap languidly upon the tall white pole because it looked so pretty there.",1
3546,"Yet his neck was not stiff, nor his eye hard. Neither was he very proud. For he had seen the men who lean upon their sills at evening, and those who swarm from rat holes in the ground, and often he had wondered what their lives were like.",1
3547,"Mr. Jack finished shaving and rinsed his glowing face, first with hot water, then with cold. He dried it with a fresh towel, and he rubbed it carefully with a fragrant, gently stinging lotion. This done, he stood for a moment, satisfied, regarding his image, softly caressing the velvet texture of dose-shaved, ruddy cheeks with stroking fingertips. Then he turned briskly away, ready for his bath.",1
3549,"All this he now anticipated eagerly as he let fall with a full thud the heavy silver-headed waste-pipe stopper. He turned the hot-water tap on as far as it would go, and watched a moment as the tumbling water began smokily to fill the tub with its thick boiling gurgle. Then, scuffing the slippers from his feet, he rapidly stripped off his silk pyjamas. He felt with pride the firm-swelling flexor muscle of his upper arm, and observed with keen satisfaction the reflection in the mirror of his plump, well-conditioned body. He was well-moulded and solid-looking, with hardly a trace of unwholesome fat upon him--a little undulance, perhaps, across the kidneys, a mere suggestion of a bay about the waist, but not enough to cause concern, and far less than he had seen on many men twenty years his junior. Content, deep and glowing, filled him. He turned the water off and tested it with a finger, which he jerked back with an exclamation of hurt surprise. In his self-absorption he had forgotten the cold water, so now he turned it on and waited while it seethed with tiny milky bubbles and sent waves of trembling light across the hot blue surface of his bath. At last he tried it with a cautious toe and found it tempered to his liking. He shut the water off.",1
3550,"And now, stepping back a pace or two, he gripped the warm tiling of the floor with his bare toes, straightened up with military smartness, drew in a deep breath, and vigorously began his morning exercises. With stiffened legs he bent strongly towards the floor, grunting as his groping finger-tips just grazed the tiling. Then he swung into punctual rhythms, counting: ""One!--Two!--Three!--Four! as his body moved. And all the time while his arms beat their regular strokes through the air, his thoughts continued to amble down the pleasant groove that his life had worn for them.",1
3555,"What happened to you, darling? I thought that You would never get here. He liked all the things that men are fond of.",1
3560,"Mr. Jack's brow was darkened as he thought of it. He muttered wordlessly. If fools are fools, let them be fools where their folly will not injure or impede the slumbers of a serious man.",1
3561,"Yes, Men could rob, lie, murder, swindle, trick, and cheat--the whole world knew as much. And women--well, they were women, and there was no help for that. Mr. Jack had also known something of the pain and folly that twist the indignant soul of youth--it was too bad, of course, too bad. But regardless of all this, the day was day and men must work, the night was night and men must sleep, and it was, he felt, intolerable----  ""One!""  Red of face, he bent stiffly, with a grunt, until his fingers grazed the rich cream tiling of the bathroom floor.",1
3565,"Then with a vigorous and jubilant movement she flung the covers off of her small and opulent body, which was clothed with a long, sleeveless garment of thin yellow silk. She bent her knees briskly, drew her feet from beneath the covers, and straightened out flat again. She surveyed her small feet with a look of wonder and delight. The sight of her toes in perfect and solid alignment and of their healthy, shining nails filled her with pleasure.",1
3567,"What magic! she thought. What magic and strength are in them! God, how beautiful they are, and what things they can do! The design for everything I undertake comes out of me in the most wonderful and exciting way. It is all distilled and brewed inside of me--and yet nobody ever asks me how it happens! First, it is all one piece--like something solid in the head,"" she thought comically, now wrinkling her forehead with an almost animal-like expression of bewildered difficulty. Then it all breaks up into little particles, and somehow arranges itself, and then it starts to move! she thought triumphantly. First I can feel it coming down along my neck and shoulders, and then it is moving up across my legs and belly, then it meets and joins together like a star. Then it flows out into my arms until it reaches down into my finger-tips--and then the hand just does what I want it to. It makes a line, and everything I want is in that line. It puts a fold into a piece of cloth, and no one else on earth could put it in that way, or make it look the same. It gives a turn to the spoon, a prod to the fork, a dash of pepper when I cook for George,"" she thought, ""and there's a dish the finest chef on earth could never equal--because it's got me in it, heart and soul and all my love,"" she thought with triumphant joy. Yes! And everything I've ever done has been the same--always the clear design, the line of life, running like a thread of gold all through me back to the time I was a child. Now, having surveyed her deft and beautiful hands, she began deliberately to inspect her other members.",1
3572,"But the way she appeared most often, and the way people remembered her best, was as a glowing, jolly, indomitably active and eager little creature in whose delicate face the image of the child peered out with joyfulness and immortal confidence. Then her apple-cheeks would glow with health and freshness, and when she came into a room she filled it with her loveliness and gave to everything about her the colour of morning life and innocence. So, too, when she went out on the streets, among the thrusting throngs of desolate and sterile people, her face shone forth like a deathless flower among their dead, grey flesh and dark, dead eyes. They milled past her with their indistinguishable faces set in familiar expressions of inept hardness, betraying cunning without an end, guile without a purpose, cynical knowledge without faith or wisdom, yet even among these hordes of the unburied dead some would halt suddenly in the dreary fury of their existence and would stare at her with their harassed and driven eyes. Her whole figure with its fertile curves, opulent as the earth, belonged to an order of humanity so different from that of their own starved barrenness that they gazed after her like wretches trapped and damned in hell who, for one brief moment, had been granted a vision of living and imperishable beauty.",1
3573,"As Mrs. Jack stood there beside her bed, her maidservant, Nora Fogarty, knocked at the door and entered immediately, bearing a tray with a tall silver coffee-pot, a small bowl of sugar, a cup, saucer, and spoon, and the morning Times. The maid put the tray down on a little table beside the bed, saying in a thick voice:  ""Good maar-nin', Mrs. Jack. Oh, hello, Nora!",1
3574,"the woman answered, crying out in the eager and surprised tone with which she usually responded to a greeting. How are you--hah! she asked, as if she were really greatly concerned, but immediately adding: ""Isn't it going to be a nice day? Did you ever see a more beautiful morning in your life? Oh, beautiful, Mrs. Jack!",1
3577,"No--decidedly this truculent resentment which smouldered in her eyes had nothing to do with caste. She had lived here for twenty years, enjoying the generous favour of a very good, superior sort of heathen, and growing used to almost all their sinful customs, but she had never let herself forget where the true way and the true light was, nor her hope that she would one day return into the more civilised and Christian precincts of her own kind. Neither did the grievance in the maid's hot eyes come from a sense of poverty, the stubborn, silent anger of the poor against the rich, the feeling of injustice that decent people like herself should have to fetch and carry all their lives for idle, lazy wasters. She was not feeling sorry for herself because she had to drudge with roughened fingers all day long in order that this fine lady might smile rosily and keep beautiful. Nora knew full well that there was no task in all the household range of duties, whether of serving, mending, cooking, cleaning, or repairing, which her mistress could not do far better and with more dispatch than her.",1
3579,"The maid had also seen enough of the hard world in which her mistress daily strove and conquered to convince herself that even if she had had any of the immense talent and knowledge that her mistress possessed, she did not have in all her lazy body as much energy, resolution, and power as the other woman carried in the tip of her little finger. And this awareness, so far from arousing any feeling of inferiority in her, only contributed to her self-satisfaction, making her feel that it was Mrs. Jack, not herself, who was really the working woman, and that she--enjoying the same food, the same drink, the same shelter, even the same clothing--would not swap places with her for anything on earth. Yes, the maid knew that she was fortunate and had no cause for complaint; yet her grievance, ugly and perverse, glowered implacably in her inflamed and mutinous eyes. And she could not have found a word or reason for it. But as the two women faced each other no word was needed. The reason for it was printed in their flesh, legible in everything they did. It was not against Mrs. Jack's wealth, authority, and position that the maid's rancour was directed, but against something much more personal and indefinable--against the very tone and quality of the other woman's life. For within the past year there had come over the maid a distempered sense of failure and frustration, an obscure but powerful feeling that her life had somehow gone awry and was growing into sterile and fruitless age without ever having come to any ripeness. She was baffled and tormented by a sense of having missed something splendid and magnificent in life, without knowing at all what it was. But whatever it was, her mistress seemed marvellously somehow to have found it and enjoyed it to the full, and this obvious fact, which she could plainly see but could not define, goaded her almost past endurance.",1
3582,"Had they not both breathed the same air, eaten the same food, been clothed by the same garments, and sheltered by the same roof? Had she not had as much--and as good--of everything as her mistress? Yes--if anything she had had the better of it, for she would not drive herself from morning to night, she thought with contemptuous bitterness, the way her mistress did.",1
3589,"' Nora,' she says, 'if anyone calls when I'm not here, I wish ye'd take the message yerself. Mr. Jack don't like to be disturbed.'... Jesus! From what I've seen there's none of 'em that likes to be disturbed. It's love and let love wit' 'em, no questions ast an' the divil take the hindmost, so long as ye do it in yer leisure hours. But if ye're twenty minutes late fer dinner, it's where the hell have ye been, an' what's to become of us when ye neglect yer family in this way?...Sure,"" she thought, warming with a flush of humour and a more tolerant and liberal spirit, ""it's a queer world, ain't it? An' these are the queerest of the lot! Thank God I was brought up like a Christian in the Holy Church, an' still have grace enough to go to Mass when I have sinned! But then----""  As often happens with people of strong but disordered feelings, she was already sorry for her flare of ugly temper, and her affections were now running warmly in another direction:",1
3592,"That's where Fritz's liquor has been going,"" she thought. He's been furious about it... She's got to stop it. If she keeps on at this rate, she'll be no good for anything in another month or two...God! I could kill her for being such a fool! she thought. What gets into these people, anyway? Her small and lovely face now red with anger, the space between her troubled eyes cleft deeply by a frown, she determined to speak plainly and sternly to the maid without any more delay.",1
3595,"It's something Miss Edith wanted me to ask you,"" she went on quickly, somewhat timidly, discovering to her amazement that she was beginning her reproof quite differently from the way she had intended. Nora waited in an attitude of studious and submissive attention. I wonder if you or any of the other girls remember seeing a dress Miss Edith had,"" she said, and went on quickly--""one of those dresses she brought back last year from Paris. It had a funny grey-green kind of colour and she used to wear it in the morning when she went to business. Do you remember--hah? she said sharply.",1
3600,"Oh, Nora, don't be stupid! she cried furiously. How could she lose it? She's been nowhere. She's been here all the time. And the dress was here, too, hanging in her closet, up to a week ago! How can you lose a dress?"" she cried impatiently. Is it just going to crawl off your back and walk away from you when you're not looking? she said sarcastically. You know she didn't lose it! Someone's taken it!""  ""Yes, ma'am,"" Nora said with dutiful acquiescence.",1
3601,"That's what I think, too. Someone must have sneaked in here when all of yez was out an' taken it. Ah, I tell ye,"" she remarked with a regretful movement of the head, ""it's got so nowadays ye never know who to trust and who not to,"" she observed sententiously. A friend of mine who works fer some big people up at Rye was tellin' me just the other day about a man that came there wit' some kind of a floor-mop he had to sell--ast to try it out an' show 'em how it worked upon their floors, ye know, an' a finer, cleaner-lookin' boy, she says, ye wouldn't see again in yer whole lifetime. 'An' my God! she says-- I'm tellin' ye just the way she told it to me, Mrs. Jack--'I couldn't believe me own ears when they told me later what he'd done! If he'd been me own brother I couldn't have been more surprised!' she says.--Well, it just goes to show ye that----""  ""Oh, Nora, for heaven's sake!",1
3604,"At the sharp warning in her mistress's voice the maid stopped suddenly, looked quickly at her, and then was silent, with a dull flush of shame and truculence upon her face. Mrs. Jack stared back at her with a look of burning indignation, then she burst out with open, blazing anger. Look here! Mrs. Jack cried furiously. I think it's a dirty shame the way you girls are acting! We've been good to you! Nora,"" and now her voice grew gentler with pity, ""there are no girls in this town who've been better treated than you have. Don't I know it, Mrs. Jack,"" Nora answered in a lilting and earnest tone, but her eyes were sullenly hostile and resentful.",1
3606,"Mrs. Jack cried impatiently. Lord, Nora, you girls have it pretty soft. There's mighty little scrubbing that you've had to do! she said. It's the rest of us who scrub! she cried. We go out of here every morning--six days in the week--and work like hell----""  ""Don't I know it, Mrs. Jack?",1
3620,"'Mr. Shulberg has brought to this, his latest production, the full artillery of his distinguished gifts for suave direction. He has paced it brilliantly, timed it--word, scene, and gesture--with some of the most subtly nuanced, deftly restrained, and quietly persuasive acting that this season has yet seen. He has a gift for silence that is eloquent--oh, devoutly eloquent!--among all the loud but for the most part meaningless vociferation of the current stage. All this your diligent observer is privileged to repeat with more than customary elation. Moreover, Mr. Shulberg has revealed to us in the person of Montgomery Mortimer the finest youthful talent that this season has discovered. Finally----'""  Mr. Jack cleared his throat solemnly--""Ahem, ahem!""--flourished his arms forward and rattled the paper expressively, and stared drolly at his wife over the top of it.",1
3622,"she yelled, her happy face flushed with laughter and excitement. Did you hear it? Vat is dees? she said comically, making a Jewish gesture with her hands--""an ovation?--What else does he say--hah? she asked, bending forward eagerly.",1
3623,"Mr. Jack proceeded:  ""'It is therefore a pity that Miss Jack's brilliant talent should not have had better fare to feed on than was given it last evening at the Arlington. For the play itself, we must reluctantly admit, was neither----'""  ""Well,"" said Mr. Jack, stopping abruptly and putting down the paper, ""the rest of it is you know""--he shrugged slightly--""sort of soso. Neither good nor bad. He sort of pans it.--But say! he cried, with jocular indignation. I like the nerve of that guy! Where does he get this Miss Esther Jack stuff? Where do I come in?"" he said. Don't I get any credit at all for being your husband? You know,"" he said, ""I'd like to get in somewhere if it's only a seat in the second balcony. Of course""--and now he began to speak in the impersonal manner that people often use when they are being heavily sarcastic, addressing himself to the vacant air as if some invisible auditor were there, and as if he himself were only a detached observer--""of course, he's nothing but her husband, anyway. What is he? Bah! he said scornfully and contemptuously. Nothing but a business man who doesn't deserve to have such a brilliant woman for his wife! What does be know about art? Can he appreciate her? Can he understand anything she does? Can he say--what is it this fellow says? he demanded, suddenly looking at the paper with an intent stare and then reading from it again in an affected tone--""'a faultless and unobtrusive décor which warmed these ancient bones as they have not been warmed for many a Broadway moon.' I know,"" she said with pitying contempt, as if the florid words of the reviewer aroused in her no other emotion, although the pleasure which the reviewer's praise had given her was still legible in her face.",1
3631,"Mr. Jack, having taken off his glasses and polished them, having blown his nose vigorously and put his glasses on again, now lowered his head, braced his thumb stiffly on his temple and put four plump fingers across his eyes in a comical shielding position, saying rapidly in a muffled, apologetic voice:  ""I know! I know! It's all right! I was only joking,"" he said with an embarrassed smile. Then he blew his nose vigorously again, his face lost its expression of wounded feeling, and he began to talk in a completely natural, matter-of-fact tone, as if nothing he had done or said had been at all unusual. Well,"" he said, ""how do you feel? Are you pleased with the way things went last night? Oh, I suppose so,"" she answered dubiously, feeling all at once the vague discontent that was customary with her when her work was finished and the almost hysterical tension of the last days before a theatrical opening was at an end.",1
3634,"And I've got to meet some of the Arlington company for fittings again this morning,"" she concluded in a dispirited tone. What, again! Weren't you satisfied with the way they looked last night? What's the trouble?""  ""Oh""--she said with disgust--""what do you think's the trouble, Fritz?",1
3635,"There's only one trouble! It never changes! It's always the same! The trouble is that there are so many half-baked fools in the world who'll never do the thing you tell them to do! That's the trouble! God! she said frankly, ""I'm too good for it! I never should have given up my painting. It makes me sick sometimes! she burst out with warm indignation. Isn't it a shame that everything I do has to be wasted on those people? What people?""  ""Oh, you know,"" she muttered, ""the kind of people that you get in the theatre.",1
3637,"Well, I'm glad this job's at an end. I wish there was something else I could do. If I only knew how to do something else, I'd do it. Really, I would,"" she said earnestly. I'm tired of it. I'm too good for it,"" she said simply, and for a moment she stared moodily into space.",1
3652,"All that, however, was still in the future. It was very imminent, but they did not know it, for they had trained themselves to deny the evidence of their senses. In that mid-October of 1929 nothing could exceed their satisfaction and assurance. They looked about them and, like an actor, saw with their eyes that all was false, but since they had schooled themselves to accept falseness as normal and natural, the discovery only enhanced their pleasure in life.",1
3656,"For he was really a good and generous man, and an act like this, even when it came from those who had drunk royally at his expense for years and had consumed the value of a hundred barrels of beer, warmed and delighted him. Thus, while he could not escape sharing the theatrical and false view of life which was prevalent everywhere about him, he had, along with that, as kind and liberal a spirit as one was likely to meet in the course of a day's journey. Of this there was constant and repeated evidence. He would act instantly to help people in distress, and he did it again and again--for actors down on their luck, for elderly spinsters with schemes for the renovation of the stage that were never profitable, for friends, relatives, and superannuated domestics. In addition to this, he was a loving and indulgent father, lavishing gifts upon his only child with a prodigal hand.",1
3665,"Oh yeah? the other jeered, looking at the old man with eyes that had suddenly gone hard and ugly. Yeah! old John snapped back, and then turned and passed through the great arched entrance of the building, feeling that his repartee had been a little inadequate, though it was the best he had been able to manage on the spur of the moment. He was still muttering to himself as he started along the colonnade that led to the south wing.",1
3667,"One of 'em just stopped me outside the building and asked if I could spare a dime! A young fellow no older than you are, tryin' to panhandle from an old man like me! He ought to be ashamed of himself! I told him so, too. I said: 'If you was any good you'd work for it!'""  ""Yeah?"" said Ed, with mild interest.",1
3670,"John Enborg had been born in Brooklyn more than sixty years before, the son of a Norwegian seaman and an Irish serving-girl. In spite of this mixed parentage, one would have said without hesitation that he was ""old stock"" American--New England Yankee, most likely. Even his physical structure had taken on those national characteristics which are perhaps the result, partly of weather and geography, partly of tempo, speech, and local custom--a special pattern of the nerves and vital energies wrought out upon the whole framework of flesh and bone, so that, from whatever complex sources they are derived, they are recognised instantly and unmistakably as ""American"".",1
3671,"In all these ways old John was ""American"". He had the dry neck--the lean, sinewy, furrowed neck that is engraved so harshly with so much weather. He had the dry face, too, seamed and squeezed of its moisture; the dry mouth, not brutal, certainly, but a little tight and stiff and woodenly inflexible; and the slightly outcropping lower jaw, as if the jarring conflicts in the life around him had hardened the very formations of the bone into this shape of unyielding tenacity. He was not much above the average height, but his whole body had the same stringy leanness of his neck and face, and this made him seem taller. The old man's hands were large and bony, corded with heavy veins, as if he had done much work with them. Even his voice and manner of talking were distinctively ""American"". His speech was spare, dry, nasal, and semi-articulate. It could have passed with most people as the speech of a Vermonter, although it did not have any pronounced twang. What one noticed about it especially was its Yankee economy and tartness, which seemed to indicate a chronic state of sour temper. But he was very far from being an ill-natured old man, though at times he did appear to be. It was just his way. He had a dry humour and really loved the rough and ready exchange of banter that went on among the younger elevator men around him, but he concealed his softer side behind a mask of shortness and sarcastic denial.",1
3674,"Ah-h,"" he said sourly, almost in disgust, ""I don't know what you're talkin' about! The car descended and stopped, and he pulled the door open at the basement floor. Sure you do! Herbert flung back vigorously as he walked over to the line of lockers, peeled off his coat, and began to take off his collar and tie. You know those two blondes I been tellin' you about, doncha, Pop? By this time he was peeling the shirt off his muscular shoulders, then he supported himself with one hand against the locker while he stooped to take off his shoe.",1
3675,"Ah-h,"" said the old man, sour as before, ""you're always tellin' me about something. I don't even pay no attention to it. It goes in one ear and out the other. Oh yeah?"" said Herbert with a rising, ironical inflection.",1
3683,"You know what he says to me the other day? 'I wonder what all the rich mugs in this house would do,' he says, 'if they had to get down and do a hard day's work for a livin' once in a while.' That's what he says to me! ' And these old bitches'--yeah!"" cried John, nodding his head angrily--""'these old bitches,' he says, 'that I got to help in and out of cars all night long, and can't walk up a flight of stairs by themselves--what if they had to get down on their hands and knees and scrub floors like your mother and my mother did?' That's the way he goes on all the time! cried John indignantly--""and him a-gettin' his livin' from the people in this house, and takin' tips from them--and then talkin' about them like he does!--Nah-h! John muttered to himself and rapped his fingers on the wall. I don't like that way of talkin'! If he feels that way, let him get out! I don't like that fellow. Oh,"" said Herbert easily and indifferently, ""Hank's not a bad guy, Pop.",1
3693,"I got no time for such foolishness. At this point Henry, 'the night doorman, came hurriedly in from the stairway and began rattling the key in his locker door. What do you say, pal? Herbert turned to him and cried boisterously. I leave it to you. Here I get Pop all dated up with a couple of hot blondes and he runs out on me. Is that treatin' a guy right or not?""  Henry did not answer.",1
3697,"He had shifted his position and begun to drum nervously and impatiently with his old fingers upon the side of the elevator. This quick, annoyed tapping betrayed his tension, but his eyes were flinty as he returned Henry's look, and there was no mistaking his dislike of the doorman. Theirs was, in fact, the mutual hostility that is instinctive to two opposite types of personality.",1
3700,"I--I'm all up on my dues,"" said Herbert feebly. That ain't the question. We ain't talkin' about dues. For the first time there was indignant passion in the hard voice as he went on earnestly: ""Where the hell do you suppose we'd be if everybody ran out on us every time we hold a meetin'? What's the use of anything if we ain't goin' to stick together? He was silent now, looking almost sullenly at Herbert, whose red face had the hang-dog air of a guilty schoolboy.",1
3704,"About them or about you. Herbert looked at the old man and laughed, the pink spots in his cheeks flushed with good humour, his lively eyes dancing. So that's the kind of guy you think I am?"" he said, and gently poked the old fellow in the ribs with his closed fist. So you don't believe me, hunh?""  ""Ah-h, I wouldn't believe you on a stack of bibles,"" said John grouchily.",1
3705,"He pushed the lever forwards and the elevator started up. You're a lot of talk--that's what you are. I don't listen to anything you say:"" He stopped the elevator and opened the heavy door.",1
3707,"He's a lot of wind. He's always talkin' about his girls and I bet he never had a girl in his life. If he saw a blonde he'd run like a rabbit. Just a pal!"" said Herbert with mock bitterness, appealing to the maids.",1
3708,"O.K., then, Pop. Have it your own way. But when those blondes get here, tell 'em to wait till I come back. You hear? Well, you'd better not be bringin' any of 'em round here,"" said John.",1
3711,"Oh yeah?"" he shouted. He stood and glared fiercely at the old fellow for a moment, then winked at the two girls, passed through the door, and pressed the button of the passenger elevator, whose operator he was to relieve for the night. That fellow's just a lot of talk,"" said John sourly as the maids stepped into the service car and he closed the door. Always gassin' about the blondes he's goin' to bring round--but I ain't never seen none of 'em. Nah-h! he muttered scornfully, almost to himself as the car started up. He lives with his mother up in the Bronx, and he'd be scared stiff if a girl ever looked at him. Still, Herbert ought to have a girl,"" one of the maids said in a practical tone of voice.",1
3712,"Herbert's a nice boy, John.""  ""Oh, he's all right, I guess,"" the old man muttered grudgingly. And a nice-looking boy, too,"" the other maid now said. Oh, he'll do,"" said John; and then abruptly: ""What are you folks doin' to-night, anyway? There's a whole lot of packages waitin' to come up. Mrs. Jack is having a big party,"" one of the girls said.",1
3725,"Oh yeah! he snarled dryly, and this time the words were loaded with implacable and unforgiving hate. Yeah!"" said Henry tonelessly, and walked off.",1
3728,"A wrinkled line appeared between her eyes, and unconsciously she began to slip the old ring on and off her finger with a quick movement of her small hand. It was the gesture of an alert and highly able person who had come to have an instinctive mistrust of other people less gifted than herself. There was impatience and some scorn in it, a scorn not born of arrogance or any lack of warm humanity, but one that was inclined to say a trifle sharply: ""Yes, yes, I know! I understand all that. There's no need telling me that kind of thing. Let's get to the point. What can you do? What have you done? Can I depend on you to do everything that's necessary? So, as she walked briskly down the hall, thoughts too sharp and quick for definition were darting across the surface of her mind like flicks of light upon a pool.",1
3737,"For Mrs. Jack had always been contemptuous of wealth. Though she was the wife of a rich man and had not known for years the economic necessity of work, yet it was one of her unshakable convictions that she and her family could not possibly be described as ""rich"". Oh, not really,"" she would say. Not the way people are who really are. And she would look for confirmation, not at the hundred and thirty million people there impossibly below her in the world's hard groove, but at the fabulous ten thousand who were above her on the moneyed heights, and who, by the comparison, were ""really rich"".",1
3741,"Upon an enormous silver trencher at one end there was a mighty roast of beef, crisply browned all over. It had just been ""begun on"" at one side, for a few slices had been carved away to leave the sound, rare body of the roast open to the inspection of anyone who might be attracted by its juicy succulence. At the opposite end, upon another enormous trencher, and similarly carved, was a whole Virginia Ham, sugar-cured and baked and stuck all over with pungent cloves. In between and all round was a staggering variety of mouth-watering delicacies. There were great bowls of mixed green salads, and others of chicken salad, crab meat, and the pink, milky firmness of lobster claws, removed whole and perfect from their shells. There were platters containing golden slabs of smoked salmon, the most rare and delicate that money could buy. There were dishes piled with caviar, both black and red, and countless others loaded with hors d'oeuvres--with mushrooms, herring, anchovies, sardines, and small, toothsome artichokes, with pickled onions and with pickled beets, with sliced tomatoes and with devilled eggs, with walnuts, almonds, and pecans, with olives and with celery. In short, there was almost everything that anyone could desire.",1
3743,"And everywhere in that great dining-room, with its simplicity and strength, there was evident this same faultless taste, this same style that never seemed to be contrived, that was so casual and so gracious and so right. At one side the great buffet glittered with an array of flasks, decanters, bottle, syphons, and tall glasses, thin as shells. Elsewhere, two lovely Colonial cupboards stood like Graces with their splendid wares of china and of porcelain, of cut-glass and of silver, of grand old plates and cups and saucers, tureens and bowls, jars and pitchers.",1
3751,"At this moment the buzzer sounded sharply. Mrs. Jack looked startled and said quickly:  ""The door-bell rang, Janie. Then, almost to herself: ""Now who do you suppose--? Yes'm,"" said Janie, coming to the door of the maids' sitting-room.",1
3756,"I always manage everything myself. You see, I carry all of it right here--my whole equipment. He indicated the two ponderous cases. That's it,"" he said, ""everything I use--the whole show. So naturally,"" he smiled at her quickly and quite boyishly, ""I don't like to take any chances. It's all I've got. If anything went wrong--well, I'd just rather do it myself and then I know where I am. I know,"" said Mrs. Jack, nodding her head with quick understanding.",1
3761,"Is there anything we can do? Mrs. Jack asked helpfully. No--thank you--nothing,"" Mr. Logan somewhat gruntingly replied, and began to stagger down the hall with his tremendous freight. I can--get along--quite nicely--thank you,"" he grunted as he staggered through the door of the room to which she had directed him; and then, more faintly: ""Nothing--at all. She heard the two ponderous bags hit the floor with a leaden thump, and then Mr. Logan's long, expiring ""Whush!"" of exhausted relief.",1
3767,"One word from Mr. Logan himself might have settled the controversy, but that word was never spoken. Indeed, he said very little about the hubbub he had caused. As more than one critic significantly pointed out, he had ""the essential simplicity of the great artist--an almost childlike naïveté of speech and gesture that pierces straight to the heart of reality. Even his life, his previous history, resisted investigations of the biographers with the impenetrability of the same baffling simplicity. Or, as another critic clearly phrased it: ""As in the life of almost all great men of art, there is little in Logan's early years to indicate his future achievement. Like almost all supremely great men, he developed slowly--and, it might almost be said, unheeded--up to the time when he burst suddenly, like a blazing light, upon the public consciousness. However that may be, Mr. Piggy Logan's fame was certainly blazing now, and an entire literature in the higher aesthetics had been created about him and his puppets.",1
3775,"Mrs. Jack was arranging anew a vase of long-stemmed roses on a small table in the hall and glancing briefly at herself in the mirror above, turned and walked briskly and happily down the broad, deep-carpeted hallway towards her own room. Her husband was just coming from his room. He was fully dressed for the evening. She looked him over with an expert eye, and saw how well his clothes fit him and how he wore them as if they had grown on him.",1
3780,"she cried. It's really just too beautiful! The girls have behaved wonderfully--only""--the little furrow of nervous tension came between her eyes--""do keep an eye on them, won't you, Fritz? You know how they are if somebody's not round. Something's so likely to go wrong. So please do watch them, won't you, dear? And look out for Mr. Logan. I do hope-- she paused with a look of worried abstraction in her eyes.",1
3786,"Along the wall opposite the bed stood two old chests. One of them, a product of the Pennsylvania Dutch, was carved and coloured in quaint and cheerful patterns, and this contained old silks and laces and the noble Indian saris which she often loved to wear. The other was an old chest of drawers, with a few silver toilet articles and a square mirror on its top.",1
3787,"Mrs. Jack crossed the room and stood before the mirror looking at herself. First she bent forward a little and stared at her face long and earnestly with an expression of childlike innocence. Then she began to turn about, regarding herself from first one angle, then another. She put her hand up to her temple and smoothed her brow. Obviously she found herself good, for her eyes now took on an expression of rapt complacency. There was open vanity in her look as she brooded with smouldering fascination on the thick bracelet around her arm--a rich and sombre chain of ancient India, studded with dull and curious gems. She lifted her chin and looked at her neck,, tracing out with her finger-tips the design of an old necklace which she wore. She surveyed her smooth arms, her bare back, her gleaming shoulders, and the outlines of her breasts and figure, touching, patting, and half-unconsciously arranging with practiced touches the folds of her simple, splendid gown.",1
3794,"Mrs. Jack, her eyes sparkling with joy, was moving about everywhere, greeting people and stopping to talk to everyone. Her whole manner had a quality of surprised delight, as of a person who feels that wonders will never cease. Although she had invited all these people, she seemed, as she spoke to each in turn, as if she was taken aback by the happiness of an unexpected and unhoped-for encounter with an old friend whom she had not seen for a long time. Her voice, as she talked, grew a trifle higher with its excitement, even at times a little shrill, and her face glowed with pleasure. And her guests smiled at her as people smile at a happy and excited child.",1
3796,"Mrs. Jack glanced happily through the crowded rooms. It was, she knew, a notable assemblage of the best, the highest, and the fairest the city had to offer. And others were arriving all the time. At this moment, in fact, Miss Lily Mandell came in, and the tall, smouldering beauty swung away along the hall to dispose of her wraps. She was followed almost at once by Mr. Lawrence Hirsch, the banker. He casually gave his coat and hat to one of the maids, and, groomed and faultless, schooled in power, be bowed greetings through the throng towards his hostess. He shook hands with her and kissed her lightly on one cheek, saying with that cool irony that was a portion of the city style:  ""You haven't looked so lovely, darling, since the days when we used to dance the can-can together.",1
3797,"Then, polished and imperturbable, he turned away--a striking figure. His abundant hair was prematurely white, and, strangely, it gave to his clear and clean-shaven face a look of almost youthful maturity. His features, a little worn but assured, were vested in unconscious arrogance with the huge authorities of wealth. He moved, this weary, able son of man, among the crowd and took his place, assuming, without knowing he assumed, his full authorities.",1
3800,"There were a good many show people. Two young actors from the Community Guild Theatre escorted the Misses Hattie Warren and Bessie Lane, both of them grey-haired spinsters who were directors of the theatre. And, in addition to the more gifted and distinguished people, there were a number of the lesser fry, too. There was a young girl who was understudy to a dancer at one of the repertory theatres, and another woman who was the seamstress and wardrobe mistress there, and still another who had once been Mrs. Jack's assistant in her own work. For, as success and fame had come to Mrs. Jack, she had not forgotten her old friends. Though she was now a celebrity herself, she had thus escaped the banal and stereotyped existence that so many celebrities achieve. She loved life too well to cut herself off from the common run of warm humanity. In her own youth she had known sorrow, insecurity, hardship, heartbreak, and disillusion, and she had never forgotten it. Nor had she forgotten any of the people her life had ever touched. She had a rare talent for loyal and abiding friendships, and most of the people who were here to-night, even the most famous ones, were friends who she had known for many years, some of them since childhood.",1
3805,"Oh, Steve!"" she gasped. This is simply the most beautiful--the most wonderful----""  He seemed fairly to shrink away from her. His white, flabby face took on an expression of disdainful boredom that was so exaggerated it would have seemed comical if it had not been for the look of naked pleading in his hazel eyes. It was the look of a proud, noble, strangely twisted and tormented man--the look almost of a frightened child, who, even while it shrank away from the companionship and security it so desperately needed and wanted, was also pleading pitifully: ""For God's sake, help me if you can! I am afraid!",1
3814,"Oh, Jake!"" she cried excitedly and in a surprised tone, as if she had not known before that he was there. How nice of you to come! I didn't know you were back. I thought you were still in Europe. I've been and went,"" he declared humorously.",1
3819,"She shrieked again, then gasped out, ""Brussels sprouts?""  ""They still got 'em,"" said old Jake solemnly. They still got the same ones they had ten years ago. I saw Brussels sprouts this last trip that ought to be in the British Museum... And they still got that good fish,"" he went on with a suggestive leer.",1
3832,"While Mrs. Jack welcomed her friends and beamed with happiness, one part of her mind remained aloof and preoccupied. For someone was still absent, and she kept thinking of him. I wonder where he is,"" she thought. Why doesn't he come? I hope he hasn't been drinking. She looked quickly over the brilliant gathering with a troubled eye and thought impatiently: ""If only he liked parties more! If only he enjoyed meeting people--going out in the evening! Oh, well--he's the way he is. It's no use trying to change him. I wouldn't have him any different.",1
3834,"The raw odour of cheap gin hung on his breath, his eyes were slightly bright and wild, and his manner was quick and a trifle more feverish than was his wont. Just the same he was, as Esther had phrased it to herself, ""all right"". If only people--my friends--everyone I know--didn't affect him so,"" she thought. Why is it, I wonder. Last night when he telephoned me he talked so strange! Nothing he said made any sense! What could have been wrong with him? Oh, well--it doesn't matter now. He's here. I love him! Her face warmed and softened, her pulse beat quicker, and she went to meet him.",1
3839,"I'm sure you're going to have a good time,"" Esther was saying to him eagerly. You'll see--"" and she squeezed his hand. There are lots of people I want you to meet. But you must be hungry. Better get yourself something to eat first. You'll find plenty of things you like. I planned them especially for you. Go in the dining-room and help yourself. I'll have to stay here a little while to welcome all these people. After she left him to greet some new arrivals, George stood there awkwardly for a moment with a scowl on his face and glanced about the room at the dazzling assemblage.",1
3840,"In that attitude he cut a rather grotesque figure. The low brow with its frame of short black hair, the burning eyes, the small, packed features, the long arms dangling to the knees, and the curved paws gave him an appearance more simian than usual, and the image was accentuated by his not-too-well-fitting dinner jacket. People looked at him and stared, then turned away indifferently and resumed their conversations.",1
3843,"There's Amy! she said. Then, as she turned and saw the elflike head with its unbelievable harvest of ebony curls, the snub nose and the little freckles, and the lovely face so radiant with an almost boyish quality of animation and enthusiasm, she thought:  ""Isn't she beautiful!",1
3853,"It seemed, therefore, that her wealth and power and feverish energy could get her anything she wanted in any country of the world. People had once said: ""What on earth is Amy going to do next! But now they said: ""What on earth is there left for her to do? If life is to be expressed solely in terms of velocity and sensation, it seemed there was nothing left for her to do. Nothing but more speed, more change, more violence, more sensation--until the end. And the end? The end could only be destruction, and the mark of destruction was already apparent upon her. It was written in her eyes--in her tormented, splintered, and exploded vision. She had tried everything in life--except living. And she could never try that now because she had so long ago, and so irrevocably, lost the way. So there was nothing left for her to do except to die.",1
3860,"As a matter of fact, he knew the exact date, even to the month and day, when it had been finished. And, still musing on the vagaries of the sex, he thought: ""Why will they be so stupid! She must understand that to anyone who knows the least thing about Mallows' life the date is as familiar as the fourth of July!""  ""Of course,"" Mrs. Jack was saying rapidly, ""I was just a child when it was made.",1
3862,"And God!"" exclaimed Mrs. Jack, ""but I was beautiful!""  She spoke the words with such innocent delight that they lost any trace of objectionable vanity they might have had, and people smiled at her affectionately. Amy Carleton, with a hasty little laugh, said impulsively:  ""Oh, Esther! Honestly, you're the most ...1 But I mean!""--she cried impatiently, with a toss of her dark head, as if answering some invisible antagonist--""she is!""  ""In all your days,"" said Mrs. Jack, her face suffused with laughter, ""you never saw the like of me!",1
3866,"Ah, Time! The figures reeled in a drunken dance and he rubbed his hand before his eyes. In 1901! How many centuries ago was that? How many lives and deaths and floods, how many million days and nights of love, of hate, of anguish and of fear, of guilt, of hope, of disillusion and defeat here in the geologic aeons of this monstrous catacomb, this riddled isle!--In 1901! Good God! It was the very Prehistoric Age of Man! Why, all that had happened several million years ago! Since then so much had begun and ended and been forgotten--so many untold lives of truth, of youth, of old age, so much blood and sweat and agony had gone below the bridge--why, he himself had lived through at least a hundred lives of it. Yes, he had lived and died through so many births and deaths and dark oblivions of it, had striven, fought, and hoped, and been destroyed through so many centuries of it, that even memory had failed--the sense of time had been wiped out--and all of it now seemed to have happened in a timeless dream. 1901! Looked at from here and now, it was a kind of Grand Canyon of the human nerves and bones and blood and brain and flesh and words and thought, all timeless now, all congealed, all solidified in an unchanging stratum there impossibly below, mixed into a general geologic layer with all the bonnets, bustles, and old songs, the straw hats and the derbies, the clatter of forgotten hooves, the thunder of forgotten wheels upon forgotten cobbles--all merged together now with the skeletons of lost ideas in a single stratum of the sunken world--while she----  --She!",1
3871,"Poor child! Poor child! So quick and short and temporal, both you and I, thought Hook--the children of a younger kind! While these! He looked about him at the sensual volutes of strong nostrils curved with scornful mirth. These others of this ancient chemistry--unmothed, re-born, and venturesome, yet wisely mindful of the flame--these others shall endure! Ah, Time!  Poor child!",1
3875,"Webber knew that he had thought of it in an instant reflex of sympathy to put him at his ease, to make him feel less desperately shipwrecked in these glittering, sophisticated tides, to give him something ""to hold on to"". Ever since he had first met Hook and had seen his desperate shyness and the naked terror in his eyes, he had understood the kind of man he was. He had never been deceived by the show of aloof weariness or the elaborately mannered speech. Beneath these disguises he had felt the integrity, the generosity, the nobility, the aspiration in the man's tortured soul. So, now, with profound gratitude, he reached out and shook his hand, feeling as he did so like a bewildered swimmer seizing on the one thing that could sustain him in these disturbing and unfathomed currents which were edged somehow with menace. He stammered out a hasty greeting, said he would be delighted to go to lunch with him some time--any time--any time at all; and he took a place beside Hook as though he meant to stay there for the rest of the evening.",1
3881,"But the violence and the injustice of his feelings soon began to have a calming and sobering effect upon him. Then he saw the absurdity of the whole episode, and began to laugh and mock inwardly at himself. So this is why you didn't want to come! he thought scornfully. You were afraid some silly fool of an ill-bred woman would make an inane remark that would prick your delicate hide! God, what a fool you are! Esther was right!",1
3882,"But had she been right, really? He had made such an issue of it with his talk about the work he had to do as a novelist, and how he had to keep clear of her world in order to do it. Was all that just a way of rationalising his sense of social inadequacy? Had he gone to such lengths of theorising merely to spare his tender ego the ridicule and humiliation of such a scene as he had just precipitated?",1
3886,"The effect of all this was so irresistible that the ladies shrieked with laughter, and the gentlemen spluttered and guffawed. And that woman over there in the corner, the one with the mannish haircut and angular lines and hard, enamelled face, holding the hand of that rather pretty and embarrassed young girl--a nymphomaniac if ever he saw one. At the sound of the splintered phrases: ""I mean!...You know!""--Webber turned and saw the dark curls of Amy Carleton. He knew who she was, and he knew her story, but even if he had not known he thought he would have guessed a part of it by the tragic look of lost innocence in her face. But what he noticed chiefly now was the group of men who followed her about, among them the young Jew and the young Japanese--and the sight made him think of a pack of dogs trailing after a bitch in heat. It was so open, so naked, so shameless that it almost made him sick.",1
3889,"Ah, there he had it! That was part of the answer. It was not so much what they did, for in this there was no appreciable difference between themselves and him. It was their attitude of acceptance, the things they thought and felt about what they did, their complaisance about themselves and about their life, their loss of faith in anything better. He himself had not yet come to that, he did not want to come to it. This was one of the reasons, he now knew, why he did not want to be sealed to this world that Esther belonged to.",1
3892,"As for these others in the illustrious company that Webber now saw on every side, not one of them had ever said: ""Let them eat cake! When the poor had starved, these had suffered. When the children toiled, these had bled. When the oppressed, the weak, the stricken and betrayed men had been falsely accused and put to death, these tongues had been lifted in indignant protest--if only the issue had been fashionable! These had written letters to the press, carried placards upon Beacon Hill, joined parades, made contributions, lent the prestige of their names to form committees of defence.",1
3897,"But even in the very instant that he saw it, and knew that it was so, and accepted it, he was overwhelmed with such a sudden sense of loss that he all but cried out in his pain and love. Was there, then, no simple truth and certainty to be found anywhere? Must one for ever be stretched out on the rack? Forever in his youth he had envisioned the starred face of the night with high exaltation and noble inspiration, longing to dream great dreams and think great thoughts in the company of the world's most honoured great. And now, in this very moment of the dream come true, with the ones he had always envied from afar surrounding him here 'on every side--now to have the selfless grandeur turn to dust, and to see great night itself a reptile coiled and waiting at the heart of life! To find no ear or utterance anywhere for all the blazing, baffled certitudes of youth! To find man's faith betrayed and his betrayers throned in honour, themselves the idols of his bartered faith! To find truth false and falsehood truth, good evil, evil good, and the whole web of life so changing, so mercurial!",1
3899,"Darling,"" she said eagerly, taking his hand and looking at him earnestly, ""how are you getting along? Are you all right?""  In his confusion and anguish he could not answer her for a moment, and when he did, the guilty knowledge of the decision he had just arrived at made him lash out angrily as though in self-defence. Who said I wasn't all right? he demanded harshly. Why shouldn't I be? And, instantly, seeing her gentle face, he was filled with baffled and furious regret.",1
3900,"Oh, all right, all right,"" she said hastily and placatingly. I just wanted to know if--are you having a good time?"" she said, with a little forced smile. Don't you think it's a nice party--hah? You want to meet anyone? You must know some of the people here. Before he had a chance to say anything more Lily Mandell came weaving through the crowded room to Mrs. Jack's side.",1
3902,"These two had met before, but only casually. They shook hands. And all at once Mrs. Jack's face was glowing with happiness. She put her own hands in a firm clasp upon those of the man and woman, and whispered:  ""My two.",1
3914,"It is a cause célèbre,"" he said, and, seeming to like the sound of the words, he repeated them portentously: ""A cause célèbre. Then, distinguished, polished, and contained, with casual hands loose-pocketed beneath his tails, he sauntered on. He moved off in the general direction of Miss Mandell. And yet he did not seem to follow her.",1
3921,"Not so, however, Mr. Samuel Fetzer. If Miss Mandell had hoped to work this technique on him when she wove her languorous way to his side and casually asked: ""Did you ever read anything by a man named Beddoes?""--she was in for a rude surprise. She had caught a tartar--a cherubic tartar, it is true, a benevolent tartar, an exultant, exuberant, elated tartar--but a. tartar nevertheless. For Mr. Fetzer had not only read Beddoes: he felt that he had rather discovered Beddoes. Beddoes was one of Mr. Fetzer's philobiblic pets. So he was not only ready for Miss Mandell: it almost seemed as if he had been waiting for her. She had hardly got the words out of her mouth before he fairly pounced upon her, and his pleasant face lit up all over with a look of cherubic glee as he cried:",1
3924,"Um,"" said Miss Mandell, and with an expression of drowsy loathing on her face she moved away. Mr. Hirsch did not follow her. Perfectly possessed, he had already shifted his glance back to the glowing Mr. Fetzer.",1
3925,"I mean,"" he continued, with that inflection of interested inquiry which is the mark everywhere of a cultivated intelligence, ""it always seemed to me that it was a case of misplaced personality--an Elizabethan out of his time. Or do you think so?""  ""Oh, absolutely!"" cried Mr. Fetzer, with instant and enthusiastic confirmation. You see, what I have always maintained----""  Mr. Hirsch appeared to be listening carefully.",1
3926,"He really was not following anyone. He kept his eyes focused on Mr. Samuel Fetzer's face, but something in their expression indicated that his mind was elsewhere. For Mr. Lawrence Hirsch was wounded sorrowfully. But he could wait.",1
3937,"Mr. Logan was down on his knee-pads extremely busy with his work, his mind as completely focused on it as though he had been alone in the room. He rigged up his trapezes and swings and took meticulous care in arranging each of the little wire figures of elephants, lions, tigers, horses, camels, and performers. He was evidently of a patient turn of mind, and it took him half an hour, or more to set everything up. By the time he had finished his labours and had erected a little sign which said: ""Main Entrance"", all the guests, who at first had watched him curiously, had grown tired of waiting and had resumed their interrupted talking, eating, and drinking.",1
3939,"With them was a large and somewhat-decayed looking lady of advanced middle age. She had evidently been a beauty in her palmy days, but now everything about her--arms, shoulders, neck, face, and throat--was blown, full, and loose, and made up a picture of corrupted elegance. It was a picture of what Amy Carleton might look like thirty years from now, if she were careful and survived. One felt unpleasantly that she had lived too long in Europe, probably on the Riviera, and that somewhere in the offing there was something with dark, liquid eyes, a little moustache, and pomaded hair--something quite young and private and obscene and kept.",1
3940,"This lady was accompanied by an elderly gentleman faultlessly attired in evening dress, as were all the others. He had a cropped moustache and artificial teeth, which were revealed whenever he paused to lick his thin lips lecherously and to stutter out: ""What? What?""--as he began to do almost at once. Both of these people looked exactly like characters who might have been created by Henry James if he had lived and written in a later period of decay.",1
3943,"The young men were less reserved. They spoke to her naturally, and Hen Walters greeted her quite cordially in a voice that seemed to be burbling with suppressed fun. It was not a pleasant voice: it was too moist, and it seemed to circulate round a nodule of fat phlegm. With the gleeful elation which marked his whole manner he said loudly:  ""Hello, Amy!",1
3944,"I haven't seen you for an age. What brings you here? The tone indicated, with the unconscious arrogance of his kind, that the scene and company were amusingly bizarre and beyond the pale of things accepted and confirmed, and that to find anyone he knew in such a place was altogether astounding.",1
3946,"Well, it's a very good place to be--the best I know... And I mean!""--she laughed hoarsely, jerked the cigarette from her mouth, and tossed her black curls with furious impatience--""I mean! After all, I was invited, you know!",1
3956,"Mr. Logan was now ready for the grand climax, the pièce de rèsistance of the entire occasion. This was his celebrated sword-swallowing act. With one hand he picked up a small rag doll, stuffed with wadding and with crudely painted features, and with the other hand he took a long hairpin, bent it more or less straight, forced one end through the fabric of the doll's mouth, and then began patiently and methodically to work it down the rag throat. People looked on with blank faces, and then, as the meaning of Mr. Logan's operation dawned on them, they smiled at one another in a puzzled, doubting way.",1
3959,"Many, however, seemed determined to stick it out. As for the young ""Society"" crowd, all of them continued to look on with eager interest. Indeed, as Mr. Logan went on probing with his hairpin, one young woman with the pure, cleanly chiselled face so frequently seen in members of her class turned to the young man beside her and said:  ""I think it's frightfully interesting--the way he does that.",1
3963,"And you, darling?""--turning fondly to George--""Do you like it? Are you having a good time? Lily answered in a tone of throaty disgust:  ""When he kept on pushing that long pin into the doll and all its insides began oozing out--ugh!""--she made a nauseous face--""I simply couldn't stand it any longer!",1
3968,"Mr. Jack cast a final bewildered look into the living-room, surveyed the wreckage there, then turned away with a short laugh: I'm going to my room! he said with decision. Let me know if he leaves the furniture!""  19.",1
3970,"Other people now gathered about Mrs. Jack and made their farewells. They began to leave, singly and in pairs and groups, until presently no one remained except those intimates and friends who are always the last to leave a big party--Mrs. Jack and her family, George Webber, Miss Mandell, Stephen Hook, and Amy Carleton. And, of course, Mr. Logan, who was busy amid the general wreckage he had created, putting his wire dolls back into his two enormous valises.",1
3971,"The atmosphere of the whole place was now curiously changed. It was an atmosphere of absence, of completion. Everybody felt a little bit as one feels in a house the day after Christmas, or an hour after a wedding, or on a great liner at one of the Channel ports when most of the passengers have disembarked and the sorrowful remnant know that the voyage is really over and that they are just marking time for a little while until their own hour comes to depart.",1
3976,"Outside, below them, there was the sudden roar of a fire truck, the rapid clanging of its bell. It turned the corner into Park Avenue and the powerful sound of its motors faded away like distant thunder. Mrs. Jack went to the window and looked out. Other trucks now converged upon the corner from different directions until four more had passed from sight.",1
3977,"I wonder where the fire can be,"" she remarked with detached curiosity. Another truck roared down the side street and thundered into Park. It must be quite a big one--six engines have driven past. It must be somewhere in this neighbourhood. Amy Carleton sat up and blinked her eyes, and for a moment all of them were absorbed in idle speculation about where the fire might be.",1
3981,"Oh no,"" said Mr. Logan brightly, getting clumsily to his feet. I'm quite ready, thank you, except for changing my clothes--""  ""I think that had better wait,"" said Mr. Jack. Oh, the girls!"" cried Mrs. Jack suddenly, and, snapping the ring on and off her finger, she trotted briskly towards the dining-room, ""Nora--Janie--May! Girls! We're all going downstairs--there's a fire somewhere in the building. You'll have to come with us till we find out where it is. Fire, Mrs. Jack?"" said Nora stupidly, staring at her mistress.",1
3982,"Mrs. Jack saw at a glance her dull eye and her flushed face, and thought: ""She's been at it again! I might have known it! Then aloud, impatiently:  ""Yes, Nora, fire.",1
3988,"Good girl, Edith! His daughter, Alma, he observed with satisfaction, was also taking this little adventure in her stride. She looked cool, beautiful, a bit bored by it all. The guests, of course, were taking it as a lark--and why not?--they had nothing to lose. All except that young Gentile fool--George What's-his-name. Look at him now--all screwed up and tense, pacing back and forth and darting his feverish glances in all directions. You'd think it was his property that was going up in smoke!",1
3992,"The sound of other people's voices, excited, chattering, came up the shaft to them; then the elevator door banged shut and they could hear the car going down. There was nothing to do but wait. The smell of smoke in the hallway was getting stronger all the time, and although no one was seriously alarmed, even the phlegmatic Mr. Logan was beginning to feel the nervous tension.",1
3997,"Can you tell' me where they are? She told him. He reached into a table drawer, pulled out a flashlight, and went through a door that led to the kitchen. Soon he reappeared with a box of tallow candles. He gave one to each person and lighted them.",1
4001,"Mrs. Jack had reached the door that opened on to the service landing when she heard a confused shuffling behind her in the line, and when she glanced back along the hallway she saw two teetering candles disappearing in the general direction of the kitchen. It was Cook and Nora. Oh Lord!"" cried Mrs. Jack in a tone of exasperation and despair. What on earth are they trying to do?...Nora! She raised her voice sharply. Cook had already disappeared, but Nora heard her and turned in a bewildered way. Nora, where are you going?"" shouted Mrs. Jack impatiently.",1
4004,"Mrs. Jack cried out angrily:  ""Oh, Cookie! What are you doing? You've simply got to come on now! We're waiting on you! And she thought to herself again, as she had thought so many times before: ""She's probably an old miser. I suppose she's got her wad hoarded away back there somewhere. That's why she hates to leave. Cook had disappeared again, this time into her own room.",1
4007,"Do you hear, Cook? Mrs. Jack cried furiously. You've got to come now! You can't stay here any longer!""  ""Augenblick!",1
4017,"Except for the smoke that had been in some of the halls and stairways, there was no sign of fire. As yet, few people seemed to comprehend the significance of the event which had so unceremoniously dumped them out of their sleek nests into the open weather. For the most part they were either bewildered and confused or curious and excited. Only an occasional person here and there betrayed any undue alarm over the danger which had touched their lives and fortunes.",1
4019,"His voice rose almost to a scream as he sought for her below. A woman in the crowd came forward below the window, looked up, and said quietly:  ""Yes, Albert. I can't find the key!",1
4021,You're in no danger--and the key is bound to be there somewhere. I'm sure you'll find it if you look. But I tell you it isn't here!,1
4028,"I'm sorry, Mr. Baer,"" he said obdurately, ""but we have our orders. You can't come in. The effect of this refusal was instantaneous and shocking.",1
4033,"And, roughly, he pushed the great man aside. Most of the crowd behaved very well under the stress of these unusual circumstances. Since there was no actual fire to watch, the people shifted and moved about, taking curious side looks at one another out of the corners of their eyes. Most of them had never even seen their neighbours before, and now for the first time they had an opportunity to appraise one another. And in a little while, as the excitement and their need for communication broke through the walls of their reserve, they began to show a spirit of fellowship such as that enormous beehive of life had never seen before. People who, at other times, had never deigned so much as to nod at each other were soon laughing and talking together with the familiarity of long acquaintance.",1
4034,"A famous courtesan, wearing a chinchilla coat which her aged but wealthy lover had given her, now took off this magnificent garment and, walking over to an elderly woman with a delicate, patrician face, she threw the coat over this woman's thinly covered shoulders, at the same time saying in a tough but kindly voice:  ""You wear this, dearie. You look cold.",1
4035,"And the older woman, after a startled expression had crossed her proud face, smiled graciously and thanked her tarnished sister in a sweet tone. Then the two women stood talking together like old friends. A haughty old Bourbon of the Knickerbocker type was seen engaged in cordial conversation with a Tammany politician whose corrupt plunderings were notorious, and whose companionship, in any social sense, the Bourbon would have spurned indignantly an hour before.",1
4036,"Aristocrats of ancient lineage who had always held to a tradition of stiff-necked exclusiveness could be seen chatting familiarly with the plebeian parvenus of the new rich who had got their names and money, both together, only yesterday. And so it went everywhere one looked. One saw race-proud Gentiles with rich Jews, stately ladies with musical-comedy actresses, a woman famous for the charities with a celebrated whore.",1
4040,"Mrs. Jack gazed upwards with a rapt and fascinated expression. She turned to Hook with one hand raised and lightly clenched against her breast, and whispered slowly:  ""Steve--isn't it the strangest--the most----? She did not finish. With her eyes full of the deep sense of wonder that she was trying to convey, she just stood with her hand loosely clenched and looked at him.",1
4043,"And there it was. He didn't miss a thing. And yet he stood there ridiculously, a derby hat upon his head, his hands thrust into the pockets of his overcoat, the velvet collar turned up round his neck, his face, as usual, turned three-quarters away from the whole world, his heavy-lidded, wearily indifferent eyes surveying the scene with Mandarin contempt, as if to say: ""Really, what is this curious assembly? Who are these extraordinary creatures that go milling about me? And why is everyone so frightfully eager, so terribly earnest about everything? A group of firemen thrust past him with the dripping brass-nozzled end of a great hose.",1
4048,"Amy laughed jubilantly and made a quick and sudden little gesture as if this answered everything. After all, I mean! she cried.",1
4050,"The girl, getting no answer from him, spoke now to Mrs. Jack:  ""It'll be just too bad if anything is wrong up there, won't it? Mrs. Jack, her face full of friendly reassurance, answered quickly in a gentle voice. No, dear,"" she said, ""I don't think it's bad at all. She looked up with trouble in her eyes at the billowing mass of smoke and flame which now, to tell the truth, looked not only bad but distinctly threatening; then, lowering her perturbed gaze quickly, she said to the girl encouragingly: ""I'm sure everything is going to be all right. Well,"" said the girl, ""I hope you're right...",1
4051,"Because,"" she added, apparently as an afterthought as she turned away, ""that's Mama's room, and if she's up there it'll be just too bad, won't it?--I mean, if it is too bad. With this astounding utterance, spoken casually in a flat voice that betrayed no emotion whatever, she moved off into the crowd. There was dead silence for a moment. Then Mrs. Jack turned to Hook in alarm, as if she were not certain she had heard aright.",1
4052,"Did you hear?--"" she began in a bewildered tone. But there you are! broke in Amy, with a short, exultant laugh. What I mean is--the whole thing's there!""  20.",1
4053,"Out of Control Suddenly all the lights in the building went out, plunging the court in darkness save for the fearful illumination provided by the bursts of flame from the top-floor apartment. There was a deep murmur and a restless stir in the crowd. Several young smart alecks in evening clothes took this opportunity to go about among the dark mass of people, arrogantly throwing the beams of their flashlights into the faces of those they passed.",1
4057,"For in the well-ordered world in which these people lived, something had gone suddenly wrong. Things had got out of control. They were the lords and masters of the earth, vested with authority and accustomed to command, but now the control had been taken from them. So they felt strangely helpless, no longer able to command the situation, no longer able even to find out what was happening.",1
4059,It's not on the roof at all--a draught is taking it up a vent. But it's down there. He pointed with his thumb.,1
4060,"Well, then, go get it. You know what to do. It looks bad, chief.",1
4065,"The hell you say!...Where? Over track thirty-two?...They're going to flood it!...Hell! Deep in the honeycombs of the rock the lights burned green and red and yellow, silent in the eternal dark, lovely, poignant as remembered grief. Suddenly, all up and down the faintly gleaming rails, the green and yellow eyes winked out and flashed to warning red.",1
4067,"And as the great train slid to a stop, the current in the third rail was shut off and the low whine that always came from the powerful motors of the locomotive was suddenly silenced. Turning now across his instruments to another man, the engineer spoke quietly:  ""I wonder what the hell has happened,"" he said. For a long time the Limited stood a silent and powerless thing of steel, while a short distance away the water flooded down and flowed between the tracks there like a river. And five hundred men and women who had been caught up from their lives and swiftly borne from cities, towns, and little hamlets all across the continent were imprisoned in the rock, weary, impatient, frustrated--only five minutes away from the great station that was the end and goal of their combined desire. And in the station itself other hundreds waited for them--and went on waiting--restless, wondering, anxious, knowing nothing about the why of it.",1
4069,"They had battered open the doorway of the elevator shaft, and one of them had lowered himself down on to the roof of the imprisoned car half a floor below and was now cutting into the roof with his sharp axe. Have you got it, Ed?""  ""Yeah--just about...I'm almost through... This next one does it, I think. The axe smashed down again.",1
4071,"Here, Jim, reach down and get underneath the arms...Got it?...O.K... Tom, you better reach down and help Jim...Good.",1
4073,"There were fewer lines of hose in the street, and one could see firemen pulling them in and putting them back in the trucks. Other firemen were coming from the building, bringing their tools and stowing them away. All the great engines were still throbbing powerfully, but the lines that had connected them with the hydrants were uncoupled, and the water they were pumping now came from somewhere else and was rushing in torrents down all the gutters. The police still held the crowd back and would not yet permit the tenants to return to their apartments.",1
4080,"Oh, sure! Two!... Nah, there was only two--that other story was all wrong. They found the old dame... But that's what I'm tellin' yuh! She was all alone when the fire started--see! Her family was out, and when they got back they thought she was trapped up there. But they found her. She was down in the crowd. That old dame was one of the first ones out...Yeh--only two. Both of 'em was elevator men. He lowered his voice a little more, then, looking at his notes, he read carefully: ""John Enborg...age sixty-four...married...three children...lives in Jamaica, Queens...You got that?"" he said, then proceeded: ""And Herbert Anderson...age twenty-five...unmarried...lives with his mother...841 Southern Boulevard, the Bronx...Have yuh got it? Sure. Oh, sure!",1
4090,"Yes, Mrs. Jack. You all must be simply worn out! she said warmly, with her instant sympathy. Hasn't it been a thrilling evening? she went on eagerly. In all your life did you ever know of such excitement, such confusion, as we had to-night? Yes, ma'am,"" the man said, in a voice so curiously unyielding that she felt stopped and baffled by it, as she had many times before.",1
4092,"She was herself a friendly person, and she liked people round her to be friendly, too--even the servants. But already her mind was worrying loosely at the curious enigma of the doorman's personality:  ""I wonder what's wrong with him,"" she thought. He seems always so unhappy, so disgruntled, nursing some secret grievance all the time. I wonder what has done it to him. Oh, well, poor thing, I suppose the life he leads is enough to turn anyone sour--opening doors and calling cabs and helping people in and out of cars and answering questions all night long. But then, Herbert has it even worse--shut up in this stuffy elevator and riding up and down all the time where he can't see anything and where nothing ever happens--and yet he's always so sweet and so obliging about everything!",1
4098,"A tremor, faint and instant, shook her feet. She paused, startled; waited, listening...Was the old trouble with George there again to shake the deep perfection of her soul? He had been strangely quiet to-night. Why, he had hardly said two words all evening. What was the matter with him?... And what was the rumour she had heard this night? Something about stocks falling. During the height of the party she had overheard Lawrence Hirsch say something like that. She hadn't paid any attention at the time, but now it came back. Faint tremors in the market""--that's what he had said. What was this talk of tremors?  --Ah, there it was a second time!",1
4101,Your parties are too wonderful! Miss Mandell concluded. You never know what's going to happen next! With that she said her good-byes and left.,1
4102,"George was also going now, but Mrs. Jack took him by the hand and said coaxingly:  ""Don't go yet. Stay a few minutes and talk to me. Mr. Jack was obviously ready for his bed.",1
4104,"At the side entrance of the great apartment house, on the now empty cross street, one of the dark green ambulances of the police department had slid up very quietly and was waiting with a softly throbbing motor. No one was watching it. Shortly a door which led down to a basement opened. Two policemen came out, bearing a stretcher, which had something sheeted on it that was very still. They slid this carefully away into the back of the green ambulance.",1
4113,"Wasn't it all strange? she said musingly. The party--and then the fire!...I mean, the way it happened. Her tone had grown a little vague, as if there was something she could not quite express. I don't know, but the way we were all sitting here after Mr. Logan's performance...then all of a sudden the fire-engines going past...and we didn't know...we thought they were going somewhere else. There was something so--sort of weird--about it. Her brow was furrowed with her difficulty as she tried to define the emotion she felt. It sort of frightens you, doesn't it?--No, not the fire! she spoke quickly. That didn't amount to anything. No one got hurt. It was terribly exciting, really... What I mean is""--again the vague and puzzled tone--""when you think of how...big...things have got...I mean, the way people live nowadays...in these big buildings...and how a fire can break out in the very house you live in, and you not even know about it... There's something sort of terrible in that, isn't there?...And God! she burst out with sudden eagerness. In all your life did you ever see the like of them? I mean the kind of people who live here--they way they all looked as they poured out into the court? She laughed and paused, then took his hand, and with a rapt look on her face she whispered tenderly:",1
4116,"And that's as far as I could get. But wasn't it a grand beginning for a story? And now at night when I try to go to sleep, that one line of the story that I couldn't write comes back to me and haunts me, and keeps ringing in my ears. 'Long, long into the night I lay--thinking of you.' For that's the story. She moved closer to him, and lifted her lips to his.",1
4123,"It would be better so. He would tell it to her straight, the way he understood it now--tell it so she could not fail to understand it, too. But tell it--get it over with--to-morrow.",1
4131,"George Webber was just as confused and fearful as everybody else. If anything, he was more so, because, in addition to the general crisis, he was caught in a personal one as well. For at this very time he, too, had come to an end and a beginning. It was an end of love, though not of loving; a beginning of recognition, though not of fame. His book was published early in November, and that event, so eagerly awaited for so long, produced results quite different from any he had expected. And during this period of his life he learned a great deal that he had never known before, but it was only gradually, in the course of the years to come, that he began to realise how the changes in himself were related to the larger changes in the world around him.",1
4133,"His novel, Home to Our Mountains, was published the first week in November 1929. The date, through the kind of accidental happening which so often affects the course of human events, and which, when looked back on later, seems to have been attended by an element of fatality, coincided almost exactly with the beginning of the Great American Depression. The collapse of the Stock Market, which had begun in late October, was in some ways like the fall of a gigantic boulder into the still waters of a lake. The suddenness of it sent waves of desperate fear moving in ever-widening circles throughout America. Millions of people in the far-off hamlets, towns, and cities did not know what to make of it. Would its effects touch them? They hoped not. And the waters of the lake closed over the fallen boulder, and for a while most Americans went about their day's work just as usual.",1
4134,"But the waves of fear had touched them, and life was not quite the same. Security was gone, and there was a sense of dread and ominous foreboding in the air. It was into this atmosphere of false calm and desperate anxiety that Webber's book was launched.",1
4140,"As the publication day drew near, Webber felt some apprehension about the reception of his novel in Libya Hill. Ever since his trip home in September he had had a heightened sense of uneasiness and anxiety. He had seen the boom-mad town tottering on the brink of ruin. He had read in the eyes of people on the streets the fear and guilty knowledge of the calamity that impended and that they were still refusing to admit even to themselves. He knew that they were clinging desperately to the illusion of their paper riches, and that madness such as this was unprepared to face reality and truth in any degree whatever.",1
4142,"Perhaps it came from their old war, and from the ruin of their great defeat and its degraded aftermath. Perhaps it came from causes yet more ancient--from the evil of man's slavery, and the hurt and shame of human conscience in its struggle with the fierce desire to own. It came, too, perhaps, from the lusts of the hot South, tormented and repressed below the harsh and outward patterns of a bigot and intolerant theology, yet prowling always, stirring stealthily, as hushed and secret as the thickets of swamp-darkness. And most of all, perhaps, it came out of the very weather of their lives, out of the forms that shaped them and the food that fed them, out of the unknown terrors of the skies above them, out of the dark, mysterious pineland all round them with its haunting sorrow.",1
4143,"Wherever it came from, it was there--and Webber knew it. But it was not only in the South that America was hurt. There was another deeper, darker, and more nameless wound throughout the land. What was it? Was it in the record of corrupt officials and polluted governments, administrations twisted to the core, the huge excess of privilege and graft, protected criminals and gangster rule, the democratic forms all rotten and putrescent with disease? Was it in ""puritanism""--that great, vague name: whatever it may be? Was it in the bloated surfeits of monopoly, and the crimes of wealth against the worker's life? Yes, it was in all of these, and in the daily tolling of the murdered men, the lurid renderings of promiscuous and casual slaughter everywhere throughout the land, and in the pious hypocrisy of the Press with its swift-forgotten prayers for our improvement, the editorial moaning while the front page gloats.",1
4158,"Aren't you just so proud of him? He always liked you better than anybody else! Aren't you simply thrilled to death? The voice rose to a honeyed lilt, and in the pale light the face was now shaped into the doelike contours of a china doll. I'll declayah! I'm so thrilled! I know you must be walkin' on ayah! Why, I just cain't wait! I'm just dyin' to read it! I know that you're the proudest thing that evah lived! Margaret stammered out something through stiff, smiling lips, and then was left alone again, her big gaunt face strained into vacancy.",1
4162,"Now, I don't know what he said about you--Ho! Ho! Ho!--but my conscience is clear!""  Randy followed her back to the kitchen and they talked about it long and earnestly while Margaret cooked supper. They were both puzzled and bewildered by what McNabb had said. Neither of them had yet read the book, so they searched their memories for all sorts of things that might be in it, but they couldn't imagine what it was. Supper was late that night, and when Margaret brought it to the table it was burned.",1
4163,"Three weeks later, in New York, George sat in the back room of his dismal flat on Twelfth Street, reading his morning mail. He had always wanted letters. Now he had them. It seemed to him that all the letters he had been waiting for all his life, all the letters he had longed for, all the letters that had never come, had now descended in a flood.",1
4166,"It seemed to him that everyone had this, except himself. And, later, he remembered his first years in the city, his years of wandering, his first years of living utterly alone. Here, too, even more than in his college days, it seemed to him that he was always waiting for a letter that never came. That was the time when he had eaten out his heart at night in the cell-like privacy of little rooms. That was the time when he had beaten his knuckles raw and bloody at the walls that hemmed him in. That was the time--and it was ten thousand times of longing, disappointment, bitter grief, and loneliness--when his unresting mind had written to himself the letters that never came. Letters from the noble, loyal, and gracious people he had never known. Letters from the heroic and great-hearted friends that he had never had. Letters from the faithful kinsmen, neighbours, schoolmates who had all forgotten him.",1
4167,"Well, he had them now--all of them--and he had not foreseen it. He sat there in his room and read them, numb in the city's roar. Two shafts of light sank through the windows to the floor. Outside, the cat crept trembling at his merciless stride along the ridges of the back-yard fence.",1
4169,"You know who. From an old friend:  ""My dear boy,  ""What is there to say? It has come, it is here, it has happened--and now I can only say, as that good woman who brought you up and now lies dead and buried on the hill would have said: '0 God! If I had only known!' For weeks I have waited for nothing else except the moment when your book should come and I should have it in my hands. Well, it has come now. And what is there to say?",1
4173,"Those who were the victims of all this unleashed malice now struck back, almost to a man, at the hapless author--at him whom they considered to be the sole cause of their woe. Day after day their letters came, and with a perverse satisfaction in his own suffering, a desire to take upon himself now all the searing shame that he had so naively and so unwittingly brought to others, he read and re-read every bitter word of every bitter letter, and his senses and his heart were numb. They said at first that he was a monster against life, that he had fouled his own nest. Then they said he had turned against the South, his mother, and spat upon her and defiled her. Then they levelled against him the most withering charge they could think of, and said he was ""not Southern"". Some of them even began to say that he was ""not American"". This was really rather hard on him, George thought with a wry, grim humour, for if he was not American, he was not anything at all.",1
4184,"Well, it made me tired to write it. Dogged if I don't believe you! I don't see how you ever thought up all them words... But I'm gonna read it!...Some of the boys on the Club know about it already. Jeffertz was talkin' to me about it the other day. Who?""  ""Jeffertz--Matt Jeffertz, the ketcher.",1
4188,"It is me, ain't it?... Well, what d'you know?"" he yelled with evident amazement and delight. Ole Bras right there in the book! His voice grew low and more excited as, evidently turning to Myrtle, he said: ""It's me, all right! Then, to George again: ""Say, Monk""--solemnly--""you shore do make me feel mighty proud! That's what I called you up to tell you. 23.",1
4191,"He read the notices avidly, feverishly, and sooner or later he must have seen them all, for his publisher showed him the clippings as they came in from every section of the country. He would take great bunches of them home to devour. When his eager eye ran upon a word of praise it was like magic to him, and he would stride about his room in a delirium of joy. When he read a savage, harsh, unfavourable review, he felt crushed: even though it came from some little rural paper in the South, his fingers would tremble, his face turn pale, and he would wad it up in his hand and curse it bitterly.",1
4193,"After the more important reviews appeared, his mail gradually took on a different complexion. Not that the flood of damning letters from home had ceased, but now, along with them, began to come messages of another kind, from utter strangers who had read his novel and liked it. The book was doing pretty well, it seemed. 'It even appeared on some of the best-seller lists, and then things really began to happen. Soon his box was stuffed with fan mail, and the telephone jingled merrily all day long with invitations from wealthy and cultivated people who wanted him for lunch, for tea, for dinner, for theatre parties, for week-ends in the country--for anything at all if he would only come.",1
4195,"But he never found it. For, in spite of all the years he had lived in New York, he was still a country boy, and he did not know about the lion hunters. They are a peculiar race of people who inhabit the upper jungles of Cosmopolis and subsist entirely on some rarefied and ambrosial ectoplasm that seems to emanate from the arts. They love art dearly--in fact, they dote on it--and they love the artists even more. So they spend their whole lives running after them, and their favourite sport is trapping literary lions. The more intrepid hunters go after nothing but the full-grown lions, who make the most splendid trophies for exhibition purposes, but others--especially the lady hunters--would rather bag a cub. A cub, once tamed and housebroken, makes a nice pet--much nicer than a lap dog--because there's just no limit to the beguiling tricks a gentle hand can teach him.",1
4196,For a few weeks George was quite the fair-haired boy among these wealthy and cultivated people. One of his new-found friends told him about an aesthetic and high-minded millionaire who was panting with eagerness to meet him. From others came further confirmation of the fact.,1
4198,"When the millionaire heard this, his great heart began to bleed for the young author immediately. It was intolerable, he said, that such a state of affairs should exist. America was the only country in the world where it would be permitted. Anywhere in Europe--yes, even in poor little Austria!--the artist would be subsidised, the ugly threat of poverty that hung over him would be removed, his best energies would be released to do his finest work--and, by God, he was going to see that this was done for George!",1
4201,"A month, six weeks, two months went by, and George heard nothing from the man. It was well into the new year before he saw him again, and then by accident. A young lady had invited George to have lunch with her at an expensive speak-easy. As soon as they entered the place George saw his millionaire friend sitting alone at one of the tables. Immediately George uttered a cry of joy and started across the room to meet him with his hand outstretched, and in such precipitate haste that he fell sprawling across an intervening table and two chairs. When he picked himself up from the floor, the man had drawn back with an expression of surprise and perplexity on his face, but he unbent sufficiently to take the young man's proffered hand and to say coolly, in an amused and tolerant voice:  ""Ah--it's our writer friend again?",1
4202,"How are you?""  The young man's crestfallen confusion and embarrassment were so evident that the rich man's heart was quite touched. His distant manner thawed out instantly, and now nothing would do but that George should bring the young lady over to the millionaire's table so that they could all have lunch together. During the course of the meal the man became very friendly and attentive. It seemed he just couldn't do enough for George. He kept helping him to various dishes and filling his glass with more wine. And whenever George turned to him he would find the man looking at him with an expression of such obvious sympathy and commiseration that finally he felt compelled to ask him what the trouble was.",1
4203,"Ah,"" he said, shaking his head with a doleful sigh, ""I was mighty sorry when I read about it. Read about what?""  ""Why,"" he said, ""the prize. What prize?""  ""But didn't you read about it in the paper?",1
4220,"She explained that her heart was buried in her husband's grave, that she was really ""a dead woman"" (she had already told him she was a great reader of psychologies), and that the act of love was just an act of devotion to dear old Algie, an effort to be with him again and to be ""a part of all this beauty. It was very fine and high and rare, and surely no one will think that George would sneer at a beautiful emotion, although it was too fine for him to understand. Therefore he went away, and never saw this lovely and sorrowful widow any more. He knew he was not fine enough. And yet, not for a moment should you think that he was ever bitter.",1
4224,"I want you to use your influence to get me into the Cosmopolis Club,"" she whispered passionately----  And then dawn came, and the stars fell. This was the last he saw of the great world of art, of fashion, and of letters. And if it seems to anyone a shameful thing that I have written thus of shameful things and shameful people, then I am sorry for it. My only object is to set down here the truthful record of George Webber's life, and he, I feel quite sure, would be the last person in the world to wish me to suppress any chapter of it. So I do not think that I have written shamefully.",1
4229,"He revealed it almost immediately:  ""Great God! What is it I have done? Sometimes I am overwhelmed by a sense of horrible and irrevocable guilt! Never before have I realised as I have this past week how terrible and great may be the distance between the Artist and the Man.",1
4231,"So speaks Man-Creating. Then, instantly, it all changes, and from Man-Creating I become simply Man-Alive--a member of society, a friend and neighbour, a son and brother of the human race. And when I look at what I have done from this point of view, suddenly I feel lower than a dog. I see all the pain and anguish I have caused to people that I know, and I wonder how I could have done it, and how there could possibly be any justification for it--yes, even if what I wrote had been as great as Lear, as eloquent as Hamlet.",1
4234,"I can't answer them. As Man-Creating, I thought I knew, and thought, too, that the answer was all-sufficient. I wrote about them with blunt directness, trying to put in every relevant detail and circumstance, and I did it because I thought it would be cowardly not to write that way, false to withhold or modify. I thought that the Thing Itself was its own and valid reason for being.",1
4243,"So it was useless to argue with them--useless to point out to them how Webber's Square differed from their own, unless to mention a hundred items of variation. They had been pitiful in their anger when t hey first discovered that art had imitated life; now they were ludicrous in their ignorance that life was also imitating art. With a smile and a shake of the head, Randy turned back to the letter:  ""In God's name, what have I done?",1
4246,"So when Randy drafted his reply he deliberately made his letter as casual as he could. He did not want to let it seem that he attached too much importance to the town's reaction. He said that he did not know what he would do if he were George, since he was not a writer, but that he had always supposed a writer had to write about the life he knew. To cheer George up, he added that the people of Libya Hill reminded him of children who had not yet been told the facts of life. They still believed, apparently, in the stork. Only people who knew nothing about the world's literature could be surprised or shocked to learn where every good book came from.",1
4252,"Whether there is any connection between the two events which have so profoundly disturbed the accustomed calm of this mountain district is not known, although their close coincidence has given rise to much excited conjecture. So,"" thought George, laying down the paper with a stunned and thoughtful air, ""it has come at last!... What was it that Judge Rumford Bland had said to them? The whole scene in the Pullman wash-room came back to him.",1
4256,"Yes,"" they would say, ""he's going somewhere.  So when, along about 1912, the word began to go round that a small group of conservative business men were talking of starting a new bank, and that Jarvis Riggs was going to be its cashier, the feeling was most favourable. The backers explained that they were not going to compete with the established banks. It was simply their feeling that a growing town like Libya Hill, with its steady increase in population and in its business interests, could use another bank. And the new bank, one gathered, was to be conducted according to the most eminently approved principles of sound finance. But it was to be a progressive bank, too, forward-looking bank, mindful of the future, the great, golden, magnificent future that Libya Hill was sure to have--that it was even heresy to doubt. In this way it was also to be a young man's bank. And this was where Jarvis Riggs came in.",1
4257,"It is not too much to say that the greatest asset the new enterprise had from the beginning was Jarvis Riggs. He had played his cards well. He had offended no one, he had made no enemies, he had always remained modest, friendly, and yet impersonal, as if not wishing to intrude himself too much on the attention of men who stood for substance and authority in the town's life. The general opinion was that he knew what he was doing. He had learned about life in the highly-thought-of ""university of hard knocks"", he had learned business and banking in ""the hard school of experience"", so everybody felt that if Jarvis Riggs was going to be cashier of the new bank, then the new bank was pretty sure to be all right.",1
4262,"Jarvis Riggs was no more insensible to these beckoning opportunities than the next man. The time had come, he decided, to step out and show the world what he could do. The Citizens Trust began to advertise itself as ""the fastest-growing bank in the state"". But it did not advertise what it was growing on.",1
4266,"Long before the explosion came that was to blow him sky-high, and the whole town with him, Jarvis Riggs had felt the tremors in the thing he had created, and he knew he was a doomed and ruined man. Before long others knew it, too, and knew that they were ruined with him. But they would not let themselves believe it. They did not dare. Instead, they sought to exorcise the thing they feared by pretending it wasn't there. Their speculations only grew madder, fiercer.",1
4269,"Jarvis Riggs leaned forward and his tones became more persuasive:  ""Pull out your money if you like, and wreck your town. But why not play along with us, Baxter? We're going to see this thing through. He was smiling now, and wearing his most winning manner. We're in a temporary depression--yes. But six months from now we'll be out of the woods. I know we will. We're coming back stronger than ever. You can't sell Libya Hill short,"" he said, using a phrase that was in great vogue just then. We've not begun to see the progress we're going to make. But the salvation and future of this town rests in your hands. So make up your mind about it. What are you going to do? The Mayor made up his mind.",1
4283,"Judge Rumford Bland testified at the inquest that he left his front office, upstairs in the ramshackle building that he owned there on the Square, and went out in the hall, heading in the direction of the toilet, where he proposed to perform an essential function of nature. It was dark out there, he said with his ghostly smile, and the floors creaked, but this didn't matter to him--he knew the way. He said he couldn't have lost his way even if he had wanted to. At the end of the hall he could hear a punctual drip of water, dropping with its slow, incessant monotone; and besides, there was the pervasive smell of the tin urinal--all he had to do was to follow his nose.",1
4288,"What happened in Libya Hill and elsewhere has been described in the learned tomes of the overnight economists as a breakdown of ""the system, the capitalist system"". Yes, it was that. But it was also much more than that. In Libya Hill it was the total disintegration of what, in so many different ways, the lives of all these people had come to be. It went much deeper than the mere obliteration of bank accounts, the extinction of paper profits, and the loss of property. It was the ruin of men who found out, as soon as these symbols of their outward success had been destroyed, that they had nothing left--no inner equivalent from which they might now draw new strength. It was the ruin of men who, discovering not only that their values were false but that they had never had any substance whatsoever, now saw at last the emptiness and hollowness of their lives. Therefore they killed themselves; and those who did not die by their own hands died by the knowledge that they were already dead.",1
4293,"Sometimes, in grimy stews of night's asylumage, an oath, a blow, a fight. Sometimes, through the still air, a shot, the letting of nocturnal blood. And always, through broken winds, the sounds of shifting engines in the station yards, far off, along the river's edge--and suddenly the thunder of great wheels, the tolling of the bell, the loneliness of the whistle cry wailed back, receding towards the North, and towards the hope, the promise, and the memory of the world unfound.",1
4297,"The new Court-House and City Hall are very splendid in the dark to-night. But he has never seen them--they were built since he went blind. Their fronts are bathed, so people say, in steady, secret light just like the nation's dome at Washington. The blind man strokes his sunken jaws reflectively. Well, they should be splendid--they cost enough.",1
4301,"He arrived early in the morning, a little after eight o'clock, and took a taxi from the station to the address on Twelfth Street and rang the bell. After a long interval and another ringing of the bell, the door lock clicked and he entered the dim-lit hall. The stairs were dark and the whole house seemed sunk in sleep. His footfalls rang out upon the silence. The air had a close, dead smell compounded of many elements, among which he could distinguish the dusty emanations of old wood and worn plankings and the ghostly reminders of many meals long since eaten. The light was out on the second-floor landing and the gloom was Stygian, so he groped along the wall until he found the door and rapped loudly with his knuckles.",1
4305,"That's better,"" said Randy in a tone of mock relief. I was afraid it might be permanent. They now clapped each other on the back and exchanged those boisterous and half-insulting epithets with which two men who have been old friends like to greet each other when they meet.",1
4306,"Then, almost at once, George asked Randy eagerly about the bank. Randy told him. George listened intently to the shocking details of the catastrophe. It was even worse than he had supposed, and he kept firing questions at Randy. At last Randy said:  ""Well, that's just about the whole story.",1
4308,"But now, as Randy put his casual finger on George's sore spot, George winced and began to pace back and forth in an agitated way without answering. Randy saw that he looked tired. His eyes were bloodshot, as if he had not slept well, and his unshaved face made him look haggard. The old bathrobe he was wearing had all the buttons missing, and the corded rope that belonged to it was also gone and George had lashed a frayed necktie round the middle to hold the thing together. This remarkable garment added to his general appearance of weariness and exhaustion. His features as he strode about the room had the contracted intensity of nervous strain, and as he looked up quickly Randy saw the worry and apprehension in his eyes.",1
4309,"Suddenly he paused and faced Randy squarely, and with a grim set to his jaws said:  ""All right, let me have it! What are they saying now?""  ""Who? What is who saying?""  ""The people back home.",1
4310,"That's what you meant, isn't it? From what they've written me and said to my face, I can imagine what they're saying behind my back. Let's have it and get it over with. What are they saying now?""  ""Why,"" said Randy, ""I don't know that they're saying anything.",1
4314,"It's gas,"" he said, as he clambered to his feet. That's the worst thing about this place--it gives me headaches when I have to spend long hours working here. While this operation had been going on, Randy took a look round.",1
4315,"The room, which was really two large rooms thrown together when the sliding-doors that joined them were pushed into the wall, as now, seemed as big as a barn. The windows at the front gave on to the street, and those at the rear looked out over some bleak little squares of backyard fences to another row of buildings. The first impression Randy got was one of staleness: the whole apartment had that unmistakable look and feeling of a place where someone has lived and where something has been finished so utterly that there is no going back to it. It was not merely the disorder everywhere--the books strewn around, the immense piles of manuscript, the haphazard scattering of stray socks, shirts and collars, old shoes, and unpressed trousers inside out. It was not even the dirty cup and saucer filled with old cigarette-butts, all of them stained with rancid coffee, which was set down in the vast and untidy litter of the table. It was just that life had gone out of all these things--they were finished--all as cold and tired and stale as the old dirty cup and the exhausted butts.",1
4321,"I certainly do appreciate it... That's mighty nice of you... Well now, I'm certainly glad you called. I hope you will remember me to all of them. Then he was silent, listening intently, and Randy gathered from the contraction of his face that the conversation had now reached another stage. In a moment he said slowly, in a somewhat puzzled tone: ""Oh, he is?... He did?... Well""--somewhat indefinitely--""that's mighty nice of him ... Yes, I'll remember...Thank you very much...Good-bye.",1
4322,"He hung up the receiver and grinned wearily. That,"" he said, ""was one of the I-just-called-you-up-to-tell-you-that- I've-read-it-all-every-word-of-it-and-I-think-it's-perfectly-grand people--another lady from the South. As he went on his voice unconsciously dropped into burlesque as he tried to imitate the unction of a certain type of Southern female whose words drip molasses mixed with venom:  ""'Why, I'll declayah, we're all just so proud of yew-w!",1
4325,"He's already bored with his first taste of fame? Fame?""--disgustedly. That's not fame--that's just plain damn rag-picking!""  ""Then you don't think the woman was sincere?""  ""Yes""--his face and tone were bitter now--""she had all the sincerity of a carrion crow.",1
4327,"It annoyed and disappointed Randy to see him acting so much like a spoiled brat, so he said:  ""Look here! It's about time you grew up and learned some sense It seems to me you're being pretty arrogant. Do you think you can afford to be? I doubt if you or any man can go through life successfully playing the spoiled genius. Again he muttered something in a sullen tone.",1
4328,"Maybe that woman was a fool,"" Randy went on. Well, a lot of people are. And maybe she hasn't got sense enough to understand what you wrote in the way you think it should be understood. But what of it? She gave the best she had. It seems to me that instead of sneering at her now, you could be grateful. George raised his head: ""You heard the conversation, then?""  ""No, only what you told me.",1
4343,"But he was so immersed in his fantasy that he paid no attention. He just said: ""Huh?""--and then was off again. Anybody who was ""a real artist,"" he said, was doomed to be an outcast from society. His inevitable fate was to be ""driven out by the tribe. It was all so wrong that Randy lost patience with him:  ""For Christ's sake, George, what's the matter with you?",1
4344,"You're talking like a fool! he said. You haven't been driven out of anywhere! You've only got yourself in a little hot water at home! Here you've been ranting your head off about 'beauty' and 'truth'! God! Why in hell, then, don't you stop lying to yourself? Can't you see? The truth is that for the first time in your life you've managed to get a foothold in the thing you want to do. Your book got some good notices and has had a fair sale. You're in the right spot now to go on. So where have you been driven? No doubt all those threatening letters have made you feel like an exile from home, but hell, man!--you've been an exile for years. And of your own accord, too! You know you've had no intention of ever going back there to live. But just as soon as they started yelling for your scalp, you fooled yourself into believing you'd been driven out by force! And, as for this idea of yours that a man achieves 'beauty' by escaping somewhere from the life he knows, isn't the truth just the opposite? Haven't you written me the same thing yourself a dozen times? How do you mean?",1
4350,"Randy saw the measure of his suffering. And yet, now as before, he seemed to be going to extremes and taking it too hard. In some such measure all men fail, and Randy said:  ""But was anything ever as good as it could be?",1
4352,"To use everything I have. To milk the udder dry, squeeze out the last drop, until there is nothing left. And if I use myself as a character, to withhold nothing, to try to see and paint myself as I am--the bad along with the good, the shoddy alongside of the true--just as I must try to see and draw every other character. No more false personal, no more false pride, no more pettiness and injured feelings. In short, to kill the wounded faun. Randy nodded: ""Yes.",1
4355,"My trouble's all the other way round! I've got too much material. It keeps backing up on me""--he gestured round him at the tottering piles of manuscript that were everywhere about the room--""until sometimes I wonder what in the name of God I'm going to do with it all--how I'm going to find a frame for it, a pattern, a channel, a way to make it flow! He brought his fist down sharply on his knee and there was a note of desperation in his voice. Sometimes it actually occurs to me that a man may be able to write no more because he gets drowned in his own secretions!""  ""So you're not afraid of ever running dry?""  He laughed loudly.",1
4360,"What's it about?"" he said. He was rewarded with an evil scowl. George did not answer. He began to pace up and down, thinking to himself with smouldering intensity. At last he stopped by the table, turned and faced Randy, and, with the redemptive honesty that was the best thing in him, bluntly said:  ""No, I haven't started my new book yet!...Thousands of words""--he whacked the battered ledgers with a flattened palm--""hundreds of ideas, dozens of scenes, of scraps, of fragments--but no book!...And""--the worried lines about his eyes now deepened--""time goes by!",1
4365,"It is though,"" George answered. That's why it looks this way. You know""--his face grew thoughtful as he spoke--""I've got an idea that a lot of the work in this world gets done by lazy people. That's the reason they work--because they're so lazy. I don't follow you,"" said Randy, ""but go on--spill it--get it off your chest.",1
4381,"You are feeling low. That's because you live in New York. Here the Stock Market is everything. When it's high, times are good; when it's low, they're bad. But New York is not America. I know,"" said George.",1
4382,"But I'm not thinking about the Stock Market. I'm thinking about America... Sometimes it seems to me,"" he continued slowly, like a man who gropes his way in darkness over an unfamiliar road, ""that America went off the track somewhere--back round the time of the Civil War, or pretty soon afterwards. Instead of going ahead and developing along the line in which the country started out, it got shunted off in another direction--and now we look round and see we've gone places we didn't mean to go. Suddenly we realise that America has turned into something ugly--and vicious--and corroded at the heart of its power with easy wealth and graft and special privilege... And the worst of it is the intellectual dishonesty which all this corruption has bred. People are afraid to think straight--afraid to face themselves--afraid to look at things and see them as they are. We've become like a nation of advertising men, all hiding behind catch phrases like 'prosperity' and 'rugged individualism' and 'the American way'. And the real things like freedom, and equal opportunity, and the integrity and worth of the individual--things that have belonged to the American dream since the beginning--they have become just words, too. The substance has gone out of them--they're not real any more...Take your own case. You say you feel free at last because you've lost your job. I don't doubt it--but it's a funny kind of freedom. And just how free are you?""  ""Well, free enough to suit me,"" said Randy heartily.",1
4386,"And when Randy left, his parting words at the station were:  ""Well, so long, fellow! You're going to be all right. But don't forget to kill that wounded faun! As for me, I don't know just what the next move is, but I'm on my way!",1
4390,"What will you have? quoth God; pay for it, and take it,"" said Emerson, in that wonderful essay on ""Compensation"" that every American ought to be required by law to read... Well, that was true. One always paid for it...  Good Lord!",1
4392,"After eighteen months his savings were gone, and he was desperate. He had to sell the old family house, and what he got for it was a mere pittance. He and Margaret rented a small apartment, and for another year or so, by careful management, they lived on what the house had brought them. Then that, too, was gone. Randy was on his uppers now. He fell ill, and it was an illness of the spirit more than of the flesh. At last, when there was nothing else to do, he and Margaret moved away from Libya Hill and went to live with the older sister who was married, and stayed there with her husband's family--dependents on the bounty of these kindly strangers.",1
4393,"And at the end of all of this, Randy--he of the clear eyes and the quick intelligence--he who was nobody's fool--he who thought he loved the truth and had always been able to see straight to the heart of most things--Randy went on relief. And by that time George thought he understood it. Behind Randy's tragedy George thought he could see a personal devil in the form of a very bright and plausible young man, oozing confidence and crying: ""Faith! when there was no faith, and dressed like a travelling salesman. Yes, salesmanship had done its job too well. Salesmanship--that commercial brand of special pleading--that devoted servant of self-interest--that sworn enemy of truth. George remembered how Randy had been able to look at his alien problem and see it in the abstract, whole and clear, because there was no self-interest to cast its shadow on his vision. He could save others--himself he could not save, because he could no longer see the truth about himself.",1
4398,"And what was he like inside while these grey years were slipping by? What was he up to, what was he doing, what did he want? That's rather hard to tell, because he wanted so many things, but the thing he wanted most was Fame. Those were the years of his concentrated quest of that fair Medusa. He had had his little taste of glory, and it was bitter in his mouth. He thought the reason was that he had not been good enough--and he had not been good enough. Therefore he thought that what be had had was not Fame at all, but only a moment's notoriety. He had been a seven-day wonder--that was all.",1
4413,"But if I disturbed yah I wantcha t'say so. Oh, no, not at all.""  ""Because here's the way it is wit' me. I'm interested in youman nature--I'm a great student of psychology--I can read faces the minute I look at a guy--it's somethin' that I always had--I guess that's why I'm in the insurance game. So when I sees a guy that interests me I wanta get acquainted wit' him an' get his reactions to things. So when I sees your light I says to myself, he may tell me to get the hell outa there but there ain't no harm in tryin'. I'm glad you did.",1
4416,"I'm a writer. A what?""  ""A writer. I wrote a book once. I'm trying to write another one now. Well now, it may surprise yah",1
4419,"An' that's the reason you're gonna be a big success at it. Stick to writin', Mr. Webber. I'm a great judge of youman nature an' I know what I'm talkin' about. Just stick to the thing yah always wanted to be an' yah'll get there. Now some guys never find theirselves. Some guys never know what they wanna be. That's the trouble wit' some guys. Now wit' me it's different. I didn't find myself till I was a grown man. You'd have t'laugh, Mr. Webber, if I told yah what it was I wanted t'be when I was a kid. What was it, Mr. Marple?""  ""Say, Mr. Webber--y'know it's funny--yah won't believe me--but up to the time I was about twenty years old, a grown man, I was crazy to be a railway engineer.",1
4420,"No kiddin'. I was nuts about it. An' I'd a-been just crazy enough to've gone ahead an' got a job on the railway if the old man hadn't yanked me by the collar an' told me t'snap out of it. Yah know I'm a Down-Easter by birth--don't talk like it any more--I been here too long--but that's where I grew up. My old man was a plumber in Augusta, Maine. So when I tells him I'm gonna be a locomotive engineer he boots me one in the seat of the pants an' tells me I ain't no such thing. 'I've sent yah to school,' he says, 'you've had ten times the schoolin' that I had, an' now yah tell me that you're gonna be a railway hogger. Well, you're not,' the old man says, 'you're gonna be one member of the fambly that's comin' home at night wit' clean hands an' a white collar. Now you get the hell outa here an' hunt yah up a job in some decent high-class business where yah'll have a chanct t'advance an' associate wit' your social ekals.' Jesus! It was a lucky thing for me he took that stand or I'd never a-got where I am to-day. But I was good an' sore about it at the time. An' say, Mr. Webber--you're gonna laugh when I tell yah this one--I ain't actually over the darn thing yet. No kiddin'. When I see one of these big engines bargin' down the track I still get that funny crawly feelin' I usta have when I was a kid an' looked at 'em. The guys at the office had t'laugh about it when I told 'em, an' now when I come in they call me Casey Jones.--Well, what d'yah say yah have another little snifter before I go?""  ""Thanks, I'd like to, but maybe I'd better not.",1
4421,"I've still got a little work I ought to do before I turn in. Well now, Mr. Webber, I know just how it is. An' that's the way I had yah sized up from the first. That guy's a writer, I says, or in some sort of intelleckshul occupation where he's got to use his head--was I right or wrong? Oh, you were right.",1
4425,"Yet he had as brave and proud a spirit as any man on earth. He longed desperately for companionship, but he would have died rather than admit he was lonely. So independent was he, and so sensitive, that, while he was always courteous and cheerful, his tone when he responded to a greeting was a little cold and distant, lest anyone should think he was too forward and eager. But, once satisfied of one's friendliness, no one could respond more warmly or more cordially than old man Wakefield.",1
4429,"he chirped angrily. Because they know we fit the Rebels--yes! and fit 'em good--and licked 'em, too! he cackled triumphantly--""in a war that was a war!...Pshaw! he said scornfully, in a lowered voice, looking out the window with a bitter smile and with eyes that had suddenly grown misty. What do these fellows know about a war?--Some bob-tail--raggedy--two-by-two--little jackleg feller--of a Legionnary! He spat the words out with a malignant satisfaction, breaking at the end into a vindictive cackle. Standin' to their necks all day in some old trench and never gettin' within ten miles of the enemy! he sneered. If they ever saw a troop of cavalry, I don't know what they'd make of it! I reckon they'd think it was the circus come to town! he cackled. A war! A war! Hell-fire, that warn't no war! he cried derisively. If they wanted to see a war, they should've been with us at the Bloody Angle! But, pshaw! he said. They'd a-run like rabbits if they'd been there! The only way you could a-kept 'em would've been to tie 'em to a tree!""  ""Don't you think they could have beaten the Rebels, Mr. Wakefield?""  ""Beat 'em?",1
4433,"It ought to, Mr. Wakefield. Why, boy,"" he said solemnly, ""if we ever did a thing like that, there would be a wave of protest--a wave of protest""--he cried with a sweeping gesture of the arm, as his voice rose strongly--""from here to Californy!... The people wouldn't stand for it! he cried. They'd make those fellers back down in a hurry!",1
4434,"And as George left him, the old man would come with him to the door, shake his hand warmly and, with an eager and lonely look in his old eyes, say:  ""Come again, boy! I'm always glad to see you!... I got stuff in here--photygraphs an' books, an' such as that about the war--that you ain't seen yet. No, nor no one else! he cackled. For no one else has got 'em!...Just let me know when you're comin' an' I'll be here. Slowly the years crept by and George lived alone in Brooklyn.",1
4435,"They were hard years, desperate years, lonely years, years of interminable writing and experimentation, years of exploration and discovery, years of grey timelessness, weariness, exhaustion, and self-doubt. He had reached the wilderness period of his life and was hacking his way through the jungles of experience. He had stripped himself down to the brutal facts of self and work. These were all he had.",1
4436,"He saw himself more clearly now than he had ever done before, and, in spite of living thus alone, he no longer thought of himself as a rare and special person who was doomed to isolation, but as a man who worked and who, like other men, was a part of life. He was concerned passionately with reality. He wanted to see things whole, to find out everything he could, and then to create out of what he knew the fruit of his own vision.",1
4442,"No wonder jesting Pilate turned away. The truth, it has a thousand faces--show only one of them, and the whole truth flies away! But how to show the whole? That's the question...  ""Discovery in itself is not enough.",1
4443,"It's not enough to find out what things are. You've also got to find out where they come from, where each brick fits in the wall. He always came back to the wall.",1
4445,"He was still searching for a way. At times he felt that his first book had taught him nothing--not even confidence. His feelings of hollow desperation and self-doubt seemed to grow worse instead of better, for he had now torn himself free from almost every personal tie which had ever bound him, and which formerly had sustained him in some degree with encouragement and faith. He was left, therefore, to rely almost completely on his own resources.",1
4451,"It was his custom almost every night, at one o'clock or later, to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, and night after night, with a horrible fascination, he used to go to the public latrine or ""comfort station"" which was directly in front of the New York City Hall. One descended to this place down a steep flight of stairs from the street, and on bitter nights he would find the place crowded with homeless men who had sought refuge there. Some were those shambling hulks that one sees everywhere, in Paris as well as New York, in good times as well as bad--old men, all rags and bags and long white hair and bushy beards stained dirty yellow, wearing tattered overcoats in the cavernous pockets of which they carefully stored away all the little rubbish they lived on and spent their days collecting in the streets--crusts of bread, old bones with rancid shreds of meat still clinging to them, and dozens of cigarette-butts. Some were the ""stumble bums"" from the Bowery, criminal, fumed with drink or drugs, or half insane with ""smoke"". But most of them were just flotsam of the general ruin of the time--honest, decent, middle-aged men with faces seamed by toil and want, and young men, many of them mere boys in their teens, with thick, unkempt hair. These were the wanderers from town to town, the riders of freight trains, the thumbers of rides on highways, the uprooted, unwanted male population of America. They drifted across the land and gathered in the big cities when winter came, hungry, defeated, empty, hopeless, restless, driven by they knew not what, always on the move, looking everywhere for work, for the bare crumbs to support their miserable lives, and finding neither work nor crumbs. Here in New York, to this obscene meeting-place, these derelicts came, drawn into a common stew of rest and warmth and a little surcease from their desperation.",1
4453,"He would talk to the men and find out all he could about them, and when he could stand it no more he would come out of this hole of filth and suffering, and there, twenty feet above it, he would see the giant hackles of Manhattan shining coldly in the cruel brightness of the winter night. The Woolworth Building was not fifty yards away, and, a little farther down were the silvery spires and needles of Wall Street, great fortresses of stone and steel that housed enormous hanks. The blind injustice of this contrast seemed the most brutal part of the whole experience, for there, all round him in the cold moonlight, only a few blocks away from this abyss of human wretchedness and misery, blazed the pinnacle of power where a large portion of the entire world's wealth was locked in mighty vaults.",1
4454,"They were now dosing up the restaurant. The tired waitresses were racking the chairs upon the tables, completing the last formalities of their hard day's work in preparation for departure. At the cash register the proprietor was totting up the figures of the day's take, and one of the male waiters hovered watchfully near the table, in a manner politely indicating that while he was not in a hurry he would be glad if the last customer would pay his bill and leave.",1
4455,"George called for his check and gave the man some money. He took it and in a moment returned with the change. He pocketed his tip and said: ""Thank you, sir. Then as George said good night and started to get up and leave, the waiter hesitated and hung round uncertainly as if there was something he wanted to say but scarcely knew whether he ought to say it or not.",1
4461,"He was evidently burning with a passionate desire to reveal his secret, but he was also obviously tormented by doubts and misgivings lest he should recklessly give away to a comparative stranger a treasure which the other might appropriate to his own use. I I is manner was very much that of a man who has sailed strange seas and seen, in some unknown coral island, the fabulous buried cache of forgotten pirates' plundering, and who is now being torn between two desperate needs--his need of partnership, of outward help, and his imperative need of secrecy and caution. The fierce interplay of these two powers discrete was waged there on the open battlefield of the waiter's countenance. And in the end he took the obvious way out. Like an explorer who will take from his pocket an uncut gem of tremendous size and value and cunningly hint that in a certain place he knows of there are many more like it, the waiter decided to tell a little part of his story without revealing it.",1
4465,"George asked feebly. Sure!"" cried the waiter, a little irritably. That's where it all takes place! That's what I'm telling you!""  He paused and looked searchingly at George, who finally asked, with just the proper note of hesitant thoughtfulness, why the lover had had to climb up so far.",1
4466,"Why,"" said the waiter impatiently, ""because the dame's old man wouldn't let him in! That was the only way the guy could get to her! The old man shut her up way up there at the top of the house because he didn't want the dame to get married!... But then,"" he went on triumphantly, ""the old man dies, see? He dies and leaves all his dough to this dame--and then she ups and marries this guy!",1
4470,"He nodded his head victoriously and cried:  ""Sure! You see, the dame's idea is this--she knows the guy's a booze hound and that sooner or later he'll come to a place where there's lots of bar-flies and fast women. That kind always hang together--sure they do!... So she opens up this joint--she sinks a lot of dough in it--it's the swellest joint they got over there. And then she puts this ad in the paper. George was not sure that he had heard aright, but the waiter was looking at him with an expression of such exuberant elation that he took a chance and said:  ""What ad?""  ""Why,"" said the waiter, ""this come-on ad that I was telling you about.",1
4471,"You see, that's the big idea--that's the plan the dame dopes out to get him back. So she puts this ad in the paper saying that any man who comes to her joint the next day will be given a ten-dollar gold piece and all the liquor he can drink. She figures that will bring him. She knows the guy is probably down and out by this time and when he reads this ad he'll show up... And that's just what happens. When she comes down next morning she finds a line twelve blocks long outside, and sure enough, here's this guy the first one in the line. Well, she pulls him out of the line and tells the cashier to give all the rest of 'em their booze and their ten bucks, but she tells this guy he ain't gonna get nothing. 'What's the reason I ain't?' he says--you see, the dame is wearing a heavy veil so he don't recognise her. Well, she tells him she thinks there's something phoney about him--gives him the old line, you know--tells him to come upstairs with her so she can talk to him and find out if he's O.K... Do you get it?""  George nodded vaguely.",1
4482,"This was the coming-out party of a fabulously rich young lady, and the like of it had not been seen since the days before the market crashed. The papers had been full of it for weeks. It was said that her father had lost millions in the debacle, but it was apparent that he still had a few paltry dollars left. So now he was doing the right thing, the expected thing, the necessary and inescapable thing, for his beautiful young daughter, who would one day inherit all that these ruinous times had left him of his hard-earned savings. To-night she was being ""presented to Society"" (whose members had known her since her birth), and all ""Society"" was there.",1
4484,"Outside the great hotel, on the Avenue in front of it and on all the side streets in the near vicinity, sleek black limousines were parked. In some of them the chauffeurs slouched dozing behind their wheels. Others had turned on their inside lights and sat there reading the pages of the tabloids. But most of them had left their cars and were knotted together in little groups, smoking, talking, idling the time away until their services should be needed again.",1
4485,"On the pavement near the entrance of the hotel, beside the huge marquee which offered shelter from the wind, the largest group of them, neat in their liveried uniforms, had gathered in debate. They were discussing politics and theories of international economy, and the chief disputants were a plump Frenchman with a waxed moustache, whose sentiments were decidedly revolutionary, and an American, a little man with corky legs, a tough, seamed face, the beady eyes of a bird, and the quick, impatient movements of the city. As George Webber came abreast of them, brought thither by the simple chance of his nightly wanderings, the argument had reached its furious climax, and he stopped a while to listen.",1
4486,"The scene, the situation, and the contrast between the two principal debaters made the whole affair seem utterly grotesque. The plump Frenchman, his cheeks glowing with the cold and his own excitement, was dancing about in a frenzy, talking and gesticulating volubly. He would lean forward with thumb and forefinger uplifted and closed daintily in a descriptive circle--a gesture that eloquently expressed the man's conviction that the case he had been presenting for immediate and bloody world revolution was complete, logical, unshakable, and beyond appeal. When any of the others interposed an objection, he would only grow more violent and inflamed.",1
4489,"Meanwhile, the chief target of this deluge, the little American with the corky legs and the birdy eyes, let him go on. He just leaned up against the building, took an occasional puff at his cigarette, and gave the Frenchman a steady look of cynical impassivity. At last he broke in to say:  ""O.K...",1
4490,"O.K., Frenchy... When you get through spoutin', maybe I'll have somethin' to say. Seulement un mot!"" replied the Frenchman, out of breath.",1
4492,"Noos! I got noos for you! he said. I haf been mit a drifer who hass in Rooshia liffed, and he says that conditions there far worser are----""  ""Non! Non!",1
4493,"the Frenchman shouted, red in the face with anger and protest. Pas vrai!...Ce n'est par possible!""  ""Oh, for Christ's sake,"" the American said, tossing his cigarette away with a gesture of impatience and disgust. Why don't you guys wake up? This ain't Russia! You're in America! The trouble with you guys,"" he went on, ""is that you've been over there all your life where you ain't been used to nothin'--and just as soon as you get over here where you can live like a human bein' you want to tear it all down. At this, others broke in, and the heated and confused dialogue became more furious than ever.",1
4494,"But the talk just went round and round in circles. George walked away into the night. The lives of men who have to live in our great cities are often tragically lonely. In many more ways than one, these dwellers in the hive are modern counterparts of Tantalus. They are starving to death in the midst of abundance. The crystal stream flows near the lips but always falls away when they try to drink of it. The vine, rich-weighted with its golden fruit, bends down, comes near, but springs back when they reach to touch it.",1
4496,"Does this explain, perhaps, the desolate emptiness of city youth--those straggling bands of boys of sixteen or eighteen that one can always see at night or on a holiday, going along a street, filling the air with raucous jargon and senseless cries, each trying to outdo the others with joyless catcalls and mirthless quips and jokes which are so feeble, so stupidly inane, that one hears them with strong mixed feelings of pity and of shame? Where here, among these lads, is all the merriment, high spirits, and spontaneous gaiety of youth? These creatures, millions of them, seem to have been born but half-made up, without innocence, born old and stale and dull and empty.",1
4500,"This is a peculiar quality of the American soul, and it contributes largely to the strange enigma of our life, which is so incredibly mixed of harshness and of tenderness, of innocence and of crime, of loneliness and of good fellowship, of desolation and of exultant hope, of terror and of courage, of nameless fear and of soaring conviction, of brutal, empty, naked, bleak, corrosive ugliness, and of beauty so lovely and so overwhelming that the tongue is stopped by it, and the language for it has not yet been uttered. How explain this nameless hope that seems to lack all reasonable foundation? I cannot. But if you were to go up to this fairly intelligent-looking truck-driver who stands and waits there with his crowd, and if you put to him your question, and if he understood what you were talking about (he wouldn't), and if he were articulate enough to frame in words the feelings that are in him (he isn't)--he might answer you with something such as this:  ""Now is duh mont' of March, duh mont' of March--now it is Sunday afternoon in Brooklyn in duh mont' of March, an' we stand upon cold corners of duh day.",1
4501,"It's funny dat dere are so many corners in duh mont' of March, here in Brooklyn where no corners are. Jesus! On Sunday in duh mont' of March we sleep late in duh mornin' den we get up an' read duh papers--dub funnies an' duh sportin' news. We eat some chow. An' den we dress up in duh afternoon, we leave our wives, we leave dub funnies littered on duh floor, an' go outside in Brooklyn in duh mont' of March an' stand around upon ten t'ousand corners of duh day. We need a corner in, duh mont' of March, a wall to stand to, a shelter an' a door. Dere must be some place inside in duh mont' of March, but we never found it. So we stand around on corners where duh sky is cold an' ragged still wit' winter, in our good clothes we stand around wit' a lot of udder guys we know, before dub, barber shop, just lookin' for a door. Ah, yes, for in summer:  It is so cool and sweet to-night, a million feet are walking here across the jungle web of Brooklyn in the dark, and it's so hard now to remember that it ever was the month of March in Brooklyn and that we couldn't find a door.",1
4505,"But he found beauty in South Brooklyn, too. There was a tree that leaned over into the narrow alley where he lived, and George could stand at his basement window and look up at it and watch it day by day as it came into its moment's glory of young and magic green. And then towards sunset, if he was tired, he could lie down to rest awhile upon his iron bed and listen to the dying birdsong in the tree. Thus, each spring, in that one tree, he found all April and the earth. He also found devotion, love, and wisdom in a shabby little Jewish tailor and his wife, whose dirty children were always tumbling in and out of the dingy suffocation of his shop.",1
4506,"In the infinite variety of such common, accidental, oft-unheeded things one can see the web of life as it is spun. Whether we wake at morning in the city, or lie at night in darkness in the country towns, or walk the streets of furious noon in all the dusty, homely, and enduring lights of present time, the universe round us is the same. Evil lives for ever--so does good. Man alone has knowledge of these two, and he is such a little thing.",1
4507,"For what is man?  First, a child, soft-boned, unable to support itself on its rubbery legs, befouled with its excrement, that howls and laughs by turns, cries for the moon but hushes when it gets its mother's teat; a sleeper, eater, guzzler, howler, laugher, idiot, and a chewer of its toe; a little tender thing all blubbered with its spit, a reacher into fires, a beloved fool. After that, a boy, hoarse and loud before his companions, but afraid of the dark; will beat the weaker and avoid the stronger; worships strength and savagery, loves tales of war and murder, and violence done to others; joins gangs and hates to be alone; makes heroes out of soldiers, sailors, prize-fighters, football players, cowboys, gunmen, and detectives; would rather die than not out-try and out-dare his companions, wants to beat them and always to win, shows his muscle and demands that it be felt, boasts of his victories and will never own defeat. Then the youth: goes after girls, is foul behind their backs among the drug-store boys, hints at a hundred seductions, but gets pimples on his face; begins to think about his clothes, becomes a fop, greases his hair, smokes cigarettes with a dissipated air, reads novels, and writes poetry on the sly. He sees the world now as a pair of legs and breasts; he knows hate, love, and jealousy; he is cowardly and foolish, he cannot endure to be alone; he lives in a crowd, thinks with the crowd, is afraid to be marked off from his fellows by an eccentricity. He joins clubs and is afraid of ridicule; he is bored and unhappy and wretched most of the time. There is a great cavity in him, he is dull.",1
4518,"The Fox During all these desperate years in Brooklyn, when George lived and worked alone, he had only one real friend, and this was his editor, Foxhall Edwards. They spent many hours together, wonderful hours of endless talk, so free and full that it combed the universe and bound the two of them together in bonds of closest friendship. It was a friendship founded on many common tastes and interests, on mutual liking and admiration of each for what the other was, and on an attitude of respect which allowed unhampered expression of opinion even on those rare subjects which aroused differences of views and of belief. It was, therefore, the kind of friendship that can exist only between two men. It had in it no element of that possessiveness which always threatens a woman's relations with a man, no element of that physical and emotional involvement which, while it serves nature's end of bringing a man and woman together, also tends to thwart their own dearest wish to remain so by throwing over their companionship a constricting cloak of duty and obligation, of right' and vested interest.",1
4520,"So it was to Foxhall Edwards that George now turned whenever his loneliness became unbearable. When his inner turmoil, confusion, and self-doubts overwhelmed him, as they often did, and his life went dead and stale and empty till it sometimes seemed that all the barren desolation of the Brooklyn streets had soaked into his very blood and marrow--then he would seek out Edwards. And he never went to him in vain. Edwards, busy though he always was, would drop whatever he was doing and would take George out to lunch or dinner, and in his quiet, casual, oblique, and understanding way would talk to him and draw him out until he found out what it was that troubled him. And always in the end, because of Edward's faith in him, George would be healed and find himself miraculously restored to self-belief.",1
4523,"So, then, life's boy is he, life's trustful child; life's guileful-guileless Fox is he, but not life's angel, not life's fool. Will get at all things like a fox--not full-tilt at the fences, not head-on, but through coverts peering, running at fringes of the wood, or by the wall; will swing round on the pack and get behind the hounds, cross them up and be away and gone when they are looking for him where he's not--he will not mean to fox them, but he will. Gets round the edges of all things the way a fox does. Never takes the main route or the worn handle. Sees the worn handle, what it is, says: ""Oh,"" but knows it's not right handle though most used: gets right handle right away and uses it. No one knows how it is done, neither knows the Fox, but does it instantly. It seems so easy when Fox does it, easy as a shoe, because he has had it from his birth. It is a genius.",1
4526,"But how""--the Aimers and the Missers plead with one another in exasperation--""how does he do it? What has the fellow got? He's nothing much to look at--nothing much to talk to. He makes no appearance! He never goes out in the world--you never see him at receptions, parties, splendid entertainments--he makes no effort to meet people--no, or to talk to them! He hardly talks at all!... What has he got? Where does it come from? Is it chance or luck? There is some mystery----""  ""Well, now,"" says one, ""I'll tell you what my theory is----""  Their heads come close, they whisper craftily together until----  ""No!"" another cries.",1
4529,"You're wrong there! The reason that he grins that grin and turns away is that he's trying hard to hear--the reason that he doesn't answer when you speak to him is that he's deaf----""  ""Ah, deaf! says still another in derision. Deaf, hell! Deaf as a Fox, he is! That deafness is a stall--a trick--a gag! He hears you when he wants to hear you! If it's anything he wants to hear, he'll hear you though you're forty yards away and talking in a whisper! He's a Fox, I tell you!""  ""Yes, a Fox, a Fox!",1
4533,"A man of five and forty years, not really seeming younger, yet always seeming something of the boy. Rather, the boy is there within that frame of face, behind the eyes, within the tenement of flesh and bone--not imprisoned, just held there in a frame--a frame a little worn by the years, webbed with small wrinkles round the eyes--invincibly the same as it has always been. The hair, once fair and blond, no longer fair and blond now, feathered at the temples with a touch of grey, elsewhere darkened by time and weather to a kind of steel-grey--blondness really almost dark now, yet, somehow, still suggesting fair and blond. The head well set and small, boy's head still, the hair sticking thick and close to it, growing to a V in the centre of the forehead, then back straight and shapely, full of natural grace. Eyes pale blue, full of a strange misty light, a kind of far weather of the sea in them, eyes of a New England sailor long months outbound for China on a clipper ship, with something drowned, sea-sunken in them.",1
4538,"Fox looked bewildered, puzzled, searched round the room again with sea-pale eyes, saw nothing, saw his hat beside him on the pillow, said, ""Oh,"" in a slightly puzzled tone, picked up the hat and jammed it on his head, half-covering the ears, swung out of bed and thrust his feet into his slippers, got up, pyjamaed and behatted, walked over to the door, opened it, looked out, and said:  ""What? Is anybody there?--Oh! For there was nothing--just the hall, the quiet, narrow hall of morning, the closed door of his wife's room, and the stairs.",1
4547,"So removes his hat, which is now jammed on so tightly that he has to take both hands and fairly wrench and tug his way out of it, hangs the battered hulk reluctantly within easy reaching distance on a hook upon the door, surveys it for a moment with an undecided air, as if still not willing to relinquish it--and then, still with a puzzled air, steps in beneath those hissing jets of water hot enough to boil an egg! Puzzled no longer, my mad masters, ye may take it, Fox comes out on the double-quick, and loudly utters: ""Damn!""--and fumes and dances, snaps his fingers, loudly utters ""Damn! again-- but gets his water tempered to his hide this time, and so, without more peradventure, takes his shower.",1
4550,"Dressed now, except for necktie, picks up necktie, suddenly observes it, a very gay one with blue polka dots, and drops it with dilating nostrils, muttering a single word that seems to utter volumes: Women!""  Then searches vaguely on a tie rack in his closet, finds a modest grey cravat, and puts it on. So, attired now, picks up a manuscript, his pince-nez glasses, opens the door, and walks out in the narrow hall.",1
4557,"Good God, what's this?""  Transfigured now to Fox's ""cosy den"" (Fox wants no ""cosy den""--will have none!) , walls are painted, bookshelves built, a reading lamp and easy chairs in place, the Fox's favourite books (Fox groans!) transplanted from their shelves upstairs and brought down here where Fox can never find them.",1
4560,"And Portia, anxiously:  ""What fo' you doesn't drink yo' orange juice, Mistah Edwands? Doesn't you like it?""  ""Fruit salad,"" repeats Fox tonelessly.",1
4562,"You can have anything you likes if you jest lets us know. We nevah knows jest what you's goin' to awdah. All las' month you awdahed fish fo' brek-fus'--is dat what you wants? Breast of guinea-hen,"" says Fox tonelessly.",1
4563,"Why, Mistah Edwahds!"" Portia squeals. Breas' of guinea-hen fo' brek-fus'?""  ""Yes,"" says Fox, patient and enduring. But, Mistah Edwahds! Portia protests. You know you doesn't want breas' of guinea-hen fo' brek-fus'!""  ""Yes,"" says Fox in his hopeless tone, ""I do.",1
4564,"And he regards her steadily with sea-misted eyes, with proud and scornful features, eloquent with patient and enduring bitterness as if to say: ""Man is born of woman and is made to mourn. But Mistah Edwahds,"" Portia pleads with him, ""fokes don't eat breas' of guinea-hen fo' brek-fus'! Dey eats ham an' aiggs, an' toast an' bacon--things like dat. Fox continues to regard her fixedly.",1
4574,"Why, no one knows. It seems to be a tribal accent, not only among all of Fox's children, but among all of their young cousins on the Fox's side. It is almost as if they were creatures of some isolated family, immured for generations on some lonely island, cut off from the world, and speaking some lost accent that their ancestors spoke three hundred years ago. Moreover, their tone is characterised by a kind of drawl--not the languorous drawl of the deep South, but a protesting drawl, a wearied-out, exasperated drawl, as if they have almost given up hope of making Fox--or someone--understand what ought to be obvious without any explanation whatsoever. Thus:  ""But nothing, daddy!",1
4580,"the girl protested. Oh, daddy, you're so-----"" she broke off, squirmed, and turned away with a little laugh. So--what?"" said Fox, low, hoarse, and scornful.",1
4584,"What are you shaking your he-a-ad for? What is it now?""  ""Is your mother up? But naturally, I don't kno-o-w!""  ""Are your sisters up?""  ""But, da-a-dy, how can I tell?""  ""Did you get to bed early?""  ""Ye-e-e-s,"" in a drawl of protest.",1
4586,"The child by now has finished with her oatmeal--all she wants of it. Now she slides out of her chair and, with face averted, tries to glide past Fox, out of the room. Fox gets up quickly, puts his arms round her, says in a low, quick, worried tone:  ""Oh, darling, where are you going?""  ""But to sch-o-o-ol, of course!""  ""Darling, stay and eat your breakfast!",1
4590,"In a low, almost inaudible tone, ""On--Whitman?""  ""Ye-e-e-s.""  ""Oh...Did you read the book I gave you--the one with his war diary and notes? Ye-e-e-s.""  ""Astonishing!"" whispers Fox. Isn't it astonishing? You can see just how he did it, can't you? He--he got right up on everything,"" Fox whispers, ""just as if he were the thing itself--as if it were happening to him!""  ""Ye-e-e-s."" She looks desperately around, then with averted eyes blurts out: ""You were right about the other thing, too.",1
4591,"What other thing?""  ""About night--how there's so much night and darkness in himhis--his feeling for night. Oh,"" Fox whispers slowly, his sea-pale eyes misted with reflection. Did you tell about that, too?""  ""Ye-e-s.",1
4593,"The girl's ivory features flush crimson. Like Fox, she loves praise, yet cannot stand to have it spoken. She squirms, is terrified, is hoping against hope----  ""I don't kno-o-w,"" she gasps.",1
4594,"Miss Allen didn't like the last paper I wrote--what I said about Mark Twain. Then,"" Fox whispers, low and scornfully, ""let Miss Allen not like it. That was a fine paper,"" he whispers. What--what you said about the River was just right. I kno-o-w!",1
4595,"And that was the part she didn't like. She didn't seem to know what I was talking about--said it was immature and not sound, and gave me a 'C'. Oh,"" says Fox absently, thinking all the time with an immense satisfaction of the spirit: ""What a girl this is!",1
4596,"She has a fine mind. She--she understands things!""  ""You see, darling,"" Fox whispers gently, coming back to Miss Allen, ""it's not their fault. These people do the best they can--but--but they just can't seem to understand,"" he whispers. You see, Miss Allen is an--an academic kind of person--I guess, kind of an old maid, really,"" he whispers, with an emphatic movement of the head--""and that kind of person, darling, just wouldn't be able to understand what Whitman and Mark Twain and Keats are like...It's--it's a shame,"" Fox mutters, and shakes his head, his eyes troubled with regret--""it's a shame we've got to hear about these people first in--in schools--from--from people like Miss Allen. You see, darling,"" Fox says gently, his face cocked sideways, his good ear pointing towards the girl, his language simple as a shoe, his face keen, shrewd, thoughtful, and absorbed, and radiant as a blade of light, as it always is when interest and reflection hold the wise serpent of his brain--""you see, darling, schools are all right, really--but the Thing they do is different from the Thing that Keats and Whitman and Mark Twain do...People like that really have no place in schools. A--a school,"" Fox whispers, ""is an academic kind of place, you see--and the people that you find in schools are academic people--and these other kind of people--the poets,"" whispers Fox, ""are not academic people--they're--they're really against what the academic people do--they are people who--who discover things for themselves,"" Fox whispers, ""who burst through and make another world--and the academic people cannot understand them--so that's why what the academic people say about them is--is not much good,"" Fox whispers. For a moment he is silent, then shakes his head and mutters in a low tone of profound regret: ""It's a pity! Too bad you've got to hear about it first in schools--but--but just do the best you can with it--get what you can from it--and--and when those people""--whisper mixed with understanding, pity, and contempt--""have gone as far as they can go, just forget about the rest they tell you. I kno-o-w!",1
4598,"By taxi?""  ""But of course not, I take the str-e-e-t car. Oh...What street car?""  ""The Lexington A-a-a-venue. Alone?"" says Fox in a low, grave, troubled tone.",1
4601,"Fox, hands upon his hips, with a look half-trouble and half-tenderness, follows her with sea-pale eyes until she has gone. Then he turns back to the table, sits down again, and picks up the paper.  News. 29. The Hollow Men"" Fox picks up the paper and settles back to read it with keen relish. The paper is the Times. (He read the Tribune late last night: waited up for it, would not miss it, has never missed it, could not sleep if he had not read it.) Morning now, Fox reads the Times.",1
4602,"How does he read the Times? He reads it the way Americans have always read the paper. He also reads it as few Americans have ever read the paper--with nostrils sensitive, dilating with proud scorn, sniffing for the news behind the news.",1
4609,"Well, then, it's news, and it happened in your own hotel, brave Admiral Drake. It didn't happen in the Penn-Pitt at Pittsburgh, nor the Phil-Penn at Philadelphia, nor the York-Albany at Albany, nor the Hudson-Troy at Troy, nor the Libya-Ritz at Libya Hill, nor the Clay-Calhoun at Columbia, nor the Richmond-Lee at Richmond, nor the George Washington at Easton, Pennsylvania, Canton, Ohio, Terre Haute, Indiana, Danville, Virginia, Houston, Texas, and ninety-seven other places; nor at the Abraham Lincoln at Springfield, Massachusetts, Hartford, Connecticut, Wilmington, Delaware, Cairo, Illinois, Kansas City, Missouri, Los Angeles, California, and one hundred and thirty-six other towns; nor at the Andrew Jackson, the Roosevelt (Theodore or Franklin--take your choice), the Jefferson Davis, the Daniel Webster, the Stonewall Jackson, the U.S. Grant, the Commodore Vanderbilt, the Waldorf-Astor, the Adams House, the Parker House, the Palmer House, the Taft, the McKinley, the Emerson (Waldo or Bromo), the Harding, the Coolidge, the Hoover, the Albert G.

An unidentified man""--well, then, this man was an American. About thirty-five years old"" with ""an assumed name""--well, then, call him C. Green as he called himself ironically in the hotel register. C. Green, the unidentified American, ""fell or jumped,"" then, ""yesterday at noon...in Brooklyn""--worth nine lines of print in to-day's Times--one of seven thousand who died yesterday upon this continent--one of three hundred and fifty who died yesterday in this very city (see dense, close columns of obituaries, page 15: begin with ""Aaronson"", so through the alphabet to ""Zorn""). C. Green came here ""a week ago""----  And came from where?",1
4610,"From the deep South, or the Mississippi Valley, or the Middle West? From Minneapolis, Bridgeport, Boston, or a little town in Old Catawba? From Scranton, Toledo, St. Louis, or the desert whiteness of Los Angeles? From the pine barrens of the Atlantic coastal plain, or from the Pacific shore?",1
4626,"C. Green had trouble over certain words, spelled them out above the coffee mug at midnight, with a furrowed brow, slow-shaping lips, and ""Jesus! when news stunned him--for he read the news. Preferred the news with pictures, too, girls with voluptuous legs crossed sensually, dresses above the knees, and plump dolls' faces full of vacant lechery. Green liked news ""hot""--not as Fox knows it, not subtly sniffing with strange-scornful nostrils for the news behind the news--but straight from the shoulder--socko!--biff!--straight off the griddle, with lots of mustard, shapely legs, roadside wrecks and mutilated bodies, gangsters' molls and gunmen's hideouts, tallow faces of the night that bluntly stare at flashlight lenses--this and talk of ""heart-balm"", ""love-thief"", ""sex-hijacker""--all of this liked Green.",1
4631,"What do you see here, Admiral Drake? Well, first, a building--your own hotel--such a building as the folk of Plymouth never saw. A great block of masonry, pale-hued, grimy-white, fourteen storeys tall, stamped in an unvarying pattern with many windows. Sheeted glass below, the store front piled with medicines and toilet articles, perfumes, cosmetics, health contrivances. Within, a soda fountain, Admiral Drake. The men in white with monkey caps, soda jerkers sullen with perpetual overdriven irritation. Beneath the counter, pools of sloppy water, filth, and unwashed dishes. Across the counter, Jewesses with fat, rouged lips consuming ice-cream sodas and pimento sandwiches.",1
4635,"The head, as we have said, is gone completely; a few fragments of the skull are scattered round--but of the face, the features, forehead--nothing! They have all been blown out, as by some inner explosion. Nothing is left but the back of the skull, which curiously remains, completely hollowed out and vacant, and curved over, like the rounded handle of a walking-stick.",1
4636,"The body, five feet eight or nine of it, of middling weight, is lying--we were going to say ""face downwards""; had we not better say ""stomach downwards""?--on the sidewalk. It is well-dressed, too, in cheap, neatly pressed, machine-made clothes: tan shoes and socks with a clocked pattern, suit of a light texture, brownish-red in hue, a neat canary-coloured shirt with attached collar--obviously C. Green had a nice feeling for proprieties! As for the body itself, save for a certain indefinable and curiously ""disjected"" quality, one could scarcely tell that every bone in it is broken. The hands are still spread out, half-folded and half-clenched, with a still-warm and startling eloquence of recent life. (It happened just four minutes ago!)",1
4638,"Th' guy that 'got it'!...Sure, that's him--you know him, that Italian kid that works inside in the news-stand--he was standin' deh beside the post! Sure, that's the guy!--talkin' to another guy--he got it all! That's the reason you didn't see more blood--this guy got it!--Sure! The guy just missed him by six inches!--Sure! I'm tellin' you I saw it, ain't I? I looked up an' saw him in the air! He'd a hit this guy, but when he saw that he was goin' to hit the lamp-post, he put out his hands an' tried to keep away! That's the reason that he didn't hit this guy!... But this guy heard him when he hit, an' turned round--and zowie!--he got all of it right in his face!",1
4644,"As if C. Green, now past considering, had considered nice ""considerations"".) A taxi-driver, impatiently: ""That's what I'm tellin' yuh!... I watched him for five minutes before he jumped. He crawled out on the window-sill an' stood there for five minutes, makin' up his mind!... Sure, I saw him! Lots of people saw him! Impatiently, irritably:-""Why didn't we do somethin' to stop him? F'r Chri' sake, what was there to do? A guy who'd do a thing like that is nuts to start with! You don't think he'd listen to anything we had to say, do you?...Sure, we did yell at him!...Jesus!... We was almost afraid to yell at him--we made motions to him to get back--tried to hold his attention while the cops sneaked round the corner into the hotel... Sure, the cops got there just a second after he jumped--I don't know if he jumped when he heard 'em comin', or what happened, but Christ!--he stood there gettin' ready for five minutes while we watched!",1
4647,"Observe now, Admiral, with what hypnotic concentration the people are examining the grimy-white facade of your hotel. Watch their faces and expressions. Their eyes go travelling upwards slowly--up--up--up. The building seems to widen curiously, to be distorted, to flare out wedgelike till it threatens to annihilate the sky, overwhelm the will, and crush the spirit. (These optics, too, American, Admiral Drake.) The eyes continue on past storey after storey up the wall until they finally arrive and come to rest with focal concentration on that single open window twelve floors up. It is no jot different from all the other windows, but now the vision of the crowd is fastened on it with a fatal and united interest. And after staring at it fixedly, the eyes come travelling slowly down again--down--down--down--the faces strained a little, mouths all slightly puckered as if something set the teeth on edge--and slowly, with fascinated measurement--down--down--down--until the eyes reach sidewalk, lamp-post, and--the Thing again.",1
4648,"The pavement finally halts all, stops all, answers all. It is the American pavement, Admiral Drake, our universal city sidewalk, a wide, hard stripe of grey-white cement, blocked accurately with dividing lines. It is the hardest, coldest, cruellest, most impersonal pavement in the world: all of the indifference, the atomic desolation, the exploded nothingness of one hundred million nameless ""Greens"" is in it.",1
4666,"It is too hard, and not to be endured--to know that little Green, speaking our own tongue and stuffed with our own stuffing, had yet concealed in him some secret, dark, and frightful thing more terrible than anything that we have ever known--that he bore within him some black and hideous horror, some depth of madness or of courage, and could stand there--upon the sheer and nauseating verge of that grey window-ledge for five full minutes--and know the thing he was about to do--and tell himself he must now!--that he had to!--that the compulsion of every horror-fascinated eye down in the gulf below had now made escape impossible--and then, horror-sick past all regeneration, see, too, before he jumped, his fall, the downward-hurtling plunge, and his own exploded body--feel the bones crack and fly apart, and the brutal obliteration of the instant when his brains would shoot out against the lamp-post--and even while his soul drew back from that sheer verge of imagined terror, shame, and unutterable self-loathing, crying: ""I cannot do it!""--then jumped! And we, brave Drake? We try to see it, but we cannot see. We try to fathom it, but we cannot plunge. We try to comprehend the hell of hells, the hundred lives of horror, madness, anguish, and despair that were exhausted in five minutes by that shabby creature crouched there on the window-ledge. But we cannot understand, or look at it any longer. It is too hard, too hard, and not to be endured. We turn away with nausea, hollowness, blind fear, and unbelief within us.",1
4669,"Then one man, turning to his companion with a little puckered smile: ""Well, what about it, Al? You still feel like eating? And his companion, quietly: ""Eating, hell! I feel like two or three stiff shots of rye! Come on, let's go round to Steve's!""  They go.",1
4671,"All's over now, all's gone, the crowd's departed. Something else remains. It cannot be forgotten. There's a sick, humid smell upon the air, what was light and clear and crystal has gone out of day, and something thick and glutinous--half taste, half smell, and all impalpable--remains upon your tongue.",1
4674,"We are ""the hollow men, the hollow men""? Brave Admiral, do not be too sure. 30. The Anodyne Fox read it instantly, the proud nose sniffing upwards sharply--""man fell or jumped...Admiral Francis Drake Hotel...Brooklyn. The sea-pale eyes took it in at once, and went on to more important things.",1
4676,"Could not have known Green, then? Was too much the patrician to know Green? Was too high, too rare, too subtle, too fine-fibred to know Green? None of these.",1
4692,"He 'tawks funny awright-- but--he don't mean what I thought he did. The first time he said somethin' I thought he was goin' t' be fresh.

Just stands lookin' at me an' says: 'Married?'""  The other: ""Gee!",1
4700,"She: ""Sure. W'y not? Number two: ""Gee, Mary, y' shouldn't do that! You don't know th' guy! How do you know who he is?""  She, abstracted, in a softer tone: ""Oh, I don't know.",1
4703,"She: ""Oh, sure. I know. I do the same. Only, it's diff'rent wit' this guy. Gee, it's funny! I musta told 'im awmost everything--all about mama, an' Pat, an' Tim, an' Helen--I guess he knows the history of the whole damn fam'ly now!

'Listen,' I says to 'im the otheh day, 'you know everything else now, I've told you the truth about everything else, so I'll come clean on this, too--that wasn't true about me bein' married.' Gee!

Number two, hungrily: ""So w'at does he say to that?""  She: ""Just looks at me an' says: 'So--what?'",1
4713,"Yes, for failure such as this, a deep, indignant sadness, a profound regret. But for other things foreordained and inevitable, not savable by any means, then a little sadness--""Too bad""--but in the end a tranquil fatality of calm acceptance: the thing had to be, it couldn't be helped. Is therefore like Ecclesiastes: has the tragic sense of life, knows that the day of birth is man's misfortune--but, knowing this, will then ""lay hold"". Has never, like the Fool, folded his hands together and consumed his flesh, but, seeing work to be done, has taken hold with all his might and done it. Knows that the end of all is vanity, but says: ""Don't whine, and don't repine, but get work done. Is, therefore, not afraid to die; does not court death, but knows death is a friend.",1
4715,"And what a life! Will we ever get to the bottom of it all?... And what a time we live in! I don't dare go to sleep at night without the paper. I cannot wait until the next one has come out--things change so fast, the whole world's in such a state of flux, the course of history may change from one edition to another. The whole thing's so fascinating, I wish I could live a hundred years to see what's going to happen! If it weren't for that--and for the children----""  A slow perplexity deepens in his eyes.",1
4716,"What will become of them? Five tender lambs to be turned loose out of the fold into the howling tumults of this dangerous and changeful earth. Five fledglings to be sent forth, bewildered and defenceless, to meet the storms of fury, peril, adversity, and savage violence that beat across the whole vexed surface of the earth--unsheltered, ignorant, unprepared, and----  ""Women.",1

Which is to say, produce more fleecelings for the fold, Fox?

O Fox, is there no answer?",1
4724,"And elsewhere on this old tormented globe, goes it much better? Fire, famine, flood, and pestilence--these trials we have always had. And hatred--most firelike, faminelike, floodlike, and most pestilential of all evils--yes, we have always had that, too. And yet, Great God! When has our old unhappy earth been stricken with such universal visitation? When has she ached in every joint as she aches now? When has she had such a universal itch, been so spavined, gouty, poxy, so broken out in sores all over?",1

We ourselves should have welcomed another book from him, just to prove that the first was not an accident. But tempus fugit, and where is Webber? Calling Mr. Webber! No answer? Well, a pity, perhaps; but then, who can count the number of one-book authors? They shoot their bolt, and after that they go into the silence and no more is heard from them. Some of us who were more than a little doubtful about that book of Webber's, but whose voices were drowned out by the Oh's and Ah's of those who rused headlong to proclaim a new star rising in the literary firmament, could now come forward, if we weren't too kindly disposed towards our more emotional brethren of the critical fraternity, and modestly say: 'We told you so!'

From all the falseness and self-deception of this cult these young gentlemen tell us they are free--without troubling to explain, however, by what process of miraculous purgation they achieved their freedom. It took Goethe, the strongest soul of modern times, some three and eighty years to free his mighty spirit of this last infirmity. Milton, old and blind, forsaken, and past fifty, is said to have won free of it by the end of Cromwell's revolution, in whose employment he destroyed his sight. And yet, can we be sure that even he was ever wholly clear, for what is the tremendous edifice of Paradise Lost except a man's final and triumphant suit against eternity?  Poor, blind Milton!",1
4739,"Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise (That last infirmity of Noble mind) To scorn delights, and live laborious dayes; But the fair Guerdon when we hope to find, And think to burst out into sudden blaze, Comes the blind Fury with th'abhorred shears, And slits the thin-spun life. But not the praise, Phoebus repli'd, and touch'd my trembling ears; Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil, Nor in the glistering foil Set off to th'world, nor in broad rumour lies, But lives and spreds aloft by those pure eyes, And perfet witnes of all judging Jove; As he pronounces lastly on each deed, Of so much fame in Heav'n expect thy meed. Deluded man! Poor vassal of corrupted time! How fair a thing for us to know that we are not such men as he and Goethe were! We live in more stirring times, and our very striplings are secure in their collective selflessness. We have freed ourselves of all degrading vanities, choked off the ravening desire for individual immortality, and now, having risen out of the ashes of our father's earth into the untainted ethers of collective consecration, we are clear at last of all that vexed, corrupted earth--clear of the sweat and blood and sorrow, clear of the grief and joy, clear of the hope and fear and human agony of which our father's flesh and that of every other man alive before us was ever wrought.",1
4744,"Behold the gem-strung towns and cities of the good, green East, flung like star-dust through the field of night. That spreading constellation to the north is called Chicago, and that giant wink that blazes in the moon is the pendant lake that it is built upon. Beyond, close-set and dense as a clenched fist, are all the jewelled cities of the eastern seaboard. There's Boston, ringed with the bracelet of its shining little towns, and all the lights that sparkle on the rocky indentations of New England. Here, southward and a little to the west, and yet still coasted to the sea, is our intensest ray, the splintered firmament of the towered island of Manhattan. Round about her, sown thick as grain, is the glitter of a hundred towns and cities. The long chain of lights there is the necklace of Long Island and the Jersey shore. Southward and inland, by a foot or two, behold the duller glare of Philadelphia. Southward farther still, the twin constellations--Baltimore and Washington. Westward, but still within the borders of the good, green East, that night-time glow and smoulder of hell-fire is Pittsburgh. Here, St. Louis, hot and humid in the cornfield belly of the land, and bedded on the mid-length coil and fringes of the snake. There at the snake's mouth, southward six hundred miles or so, you see the jewelled crescent of old New Orleans. Here, west and south again, you see the gemmy glitter of the cities on the Texas border.  Turn now, seeker, on your resting stool atop the Rocky Mountains, and look another thousand miles or so across moon-blazing fiend-worlds of the Painted Desert and beyond Sierras' ridge.",1
4746,"Observe the whole of it, survey it as you might survey a field. Make it your garden, seeker, or your backyard patch. Be at ease in it. It's your oyster--yours to open if you will. Don't be frightened, it's not so big now, when your footstool is the Rocky Mountains. Reach out and dip a hatful of cold water from Lake Michigan. Drink it--we've tried it--you'll not find it bad. Take your shoes off and work your toes down in the river oozes of the Mississippi bottom--it's very refreshing on a hot night in the summer-time. Help yourself to a bunch of Concord grapes up there in northern New York State--they're getting good now. Or raid that water-melon patch down there in Georgia. Or, if you like, you can try the Rockyfords here at your elbow, in Colorado. Just make yourself at home, refresh yourself, get the feel of things, adjust your sights, and get the scale. It's your pasture now, and it's not so big--only three thousand miles from east to west, only two thousand miles from north to south--but all between, where ten thousand points of light prick out the cities, towns, and villages, there, seeker, you will find us burning in the night.",1
4749,"Or there again, in the East-Side Ghetto of Manhattan, two blocks away from the East River, a block away from the gas-house district and its thuggery, there in the swarming tenement, shut in its sweltering cell, breathing the sun-baked air through opened window at the fire-escape, celled there away into a little semblance of privacy and solitude from all the brawling and vociferous life and argument of his family and the seething hive round him, the Jew boy sits and pores upon his book. In shirt-sleeves, bent above his table to meet the hard glare of a naked bulb, he sits with gaunt, starved face converging to his huge beaked nose, the weak eyes squinting painfully through his thick-lens glasses, his greasy hair roached back in oily scrolls above the slanting cage of his painful and constricted brow. And for what? For what this agony of concentration? For what this hell of effort? For what this intense withdrawal from the poverty and squalor of dirty brick and rusty fire-escapes, from the raucous cries and violence and never-ending noise? For what? Because, brother, he is burning in the night. He sees the class, the lecture room, the shining apparatus of gigantic laboratories, the open field of scholarship and pure research, certain knowledge, and the world distinction of an Einstein name.",1
4756,"He was a good-looking man, tall, young, ruddy, with the lean and well-conditioned figure of a cavalryman. He was an engaging kind of fellow, too--so engaging that when he made the arrangements which permitted George to take over the premises, he managed to insinuate into his bill for rent a thumping sum that covered all the electricity and gas he had used in the preceding two quarters. And electricity and gas, as George was to discover, came high in London. You read and worked by one, sometimes not only through the night, but also through the pea-soup opacity of a so-called day. And you bathed and shaved and cooked and feebly warmed yourself by the other. George never did figure out just exactly how the engaging Major Bixley-Dunton did it, but he managed it so adroitly that George was half-way back to America some six months later before it dawned on his unsuspecting mind that he had occupied the modest dwelling only two quarters but had paid four whacking assessments for the whole year's gas and electricity.",1
4758,"He had a good deal of respect for the little tailor shop. The venerable and celebrated Irish writer, Mr. James Burke, had his pants pressed there, and George had the honour of being present in the shop one night when the great man called for them. It was a considerable moment in Webber's life. He felt that he was assisting at an impressive and distinguished ceremony. It was the first time he had ever been in such intimate contact with such exalted literary greatness, and most fairminded people will agree that there are few things in the world more intimate than a pair of pants. Also, even at the moment that Mr. Burke entered the shop and demanded his trousers, George was requesting the return of his own. This homely coincidence gave him a feeling of perfectly delightful understanding and identity of purpose with a gentleman whose talents had for so many years been an object of his veneration. It gave him an easy and casual sense of belonging to the inner circle, and he could imagine someone saying to him:",1
4761,"George had inherited her, so to speak, from Major Bixley-Dunton, and when he went away he gave her back to him, to be passed on to the next young bachelor gentleman--a man, George hoped, who would be worthy of her loyalty, devotion, idolatry, and humble slavery. He had never had a servant in his life before. He had known Negro servants during his boyhood in the South; since then he had had people come in once or twice a week to clean up the various places where he had lived; but never before had he owned a servant body and soul, to the degree that her interests became his interests and her life his life; never before had he had anyone whose whole concern was the preservation of his comfort and welfare.",1
4765,"Yes, and it was good, too. Well, then, suppose we have rump steak again?""  ""Very good, sir,"" Mrs. Purvis would say, with perfect courtesy, but with a rising intonation of the voice which somehow suggested, delicately and yet unmistakably, that he could do as he pleased, but mat she rather thought his choice was not the best. Feeling this, George would immediately have doubts. He would say:  ""Oh, wait a minute.",1
4773,"Get the tea, of course, but no more eggs. I think we've had too many eggs, don't you?""  ""You 'ave, sir, you know,"" she said gently--""for the last three mornin's, at any rate. Still-- Again she paused, as if to say that if he was determined to go on having eggs, he should have them.",1
4779,"It's a good idea. By all means, get in tongue or ham and chutney. Is that all, now?""  ""Well, sir,"" she reflected a moment longer, went to the buffet sideboard, opened it, and looked in.",1
4783,"Some people prefer one kind and some another. The Worthington, perhaps is a trifle lighter, but you won't go wrong, sir, whichever one you order. All right, then, I'll tell you what you do--suppose you order half a dozen of each.",1
4788,"George had not been long in the place before he made a surprising discovery concerning this thriving practice. He and the little doctor had the same telephone, by a plug-in arrangement which permitted each to use the instrument in his own quarters while sharing the same number and the same bill. Sometimes the telephone would ring at night, after the doctor had departed for his home in Surrey, and George observed that the callers were always women. They would demand the doctor in voices that varied from accents of desperate entreaty to tones that fairly crooned with voluptuous and sensual complaint. Where was the doctor? When George informed them that he was at his home, some twenty miles away, they would moan that it couldn't be true, that it wasn't possible, that fate could assuredly not play them so cruel a joke. When told that it was indeed so, they would then sometimes suggest that perhaps George himself could render them some assistance on his own account. To these requests he was forced to reply, often with reluctance, that he was not a physician, and that they would have to seek help in some other quarter.",1
4790,"George would sometimes tease Mrs. Purvis about this unending procession of female visitors, and would openly speculate on the nature of the doctor's practice. She had a capacity for self-deception which one often encounters among people of her class, although the phenomenon is by no means confined to it. No doubt she guessed some of the things that went on below stairs, but her loyalty to anyone she served was so unquestioning that when Geprge pressed her for information her manner would instantly become vague, and she would confess that, although she was not familiar with the technical details of the doctor's practice, it was, she believed, devoted to ""the treatment of nervous diseases"".",1
4799,"There you 'ave it! Just as 'Is Grace says, we're losin' all our great estates. And what's the reason? Why the owners can no longer afford to pay the taxes. Ruinous 'e calls 'em, and 'e's, right. If it keeps up, you mark my words, the nobility'll 'ave no place left to live. A lot of 'em are migratin' already,"" she said darkly.",1
4806,"Immortal ""'E"", who lived and moved and loved and had his being there at the centre of Daisy Purvis's heaven! Immortal ""'E"", the idol of all the Purvises everywhere, who, for their uses, their devotions, had no other name and needed none but ""'E"". Of course, sir,"" Mrs. Purvis said, ""'E likes 'em, doesn't 'E? I'm told 'E's very fond of 'em. The American ladies must be very clever, sir, because 'E finds 'em so amusin'. There was a picture of 'Im in the news just recently with a party of 'Is friends, and a new American lady was among 'em. At least I'd never seen 'er face before. And very smart she was, too--a Mrs. Somebody-or-other--I can't recall the name. Again, something in the day's news would bring the reverent tone to her voice and the glow of tenderness to her face, as:  ""Well, I see by the paper 'ere that 'E's got back from the Continent.",1
4812,"I mean, can you be sure? You know, you hear all sorts of things--even a stranger like myself hears them. For one thing, you hear he doesn't want it very much, and then, of course, there is his brother, isn't there?""  ""Oh, 'im,"" said Mrs. Purvis, ""'im!",1
4814,"In fact, for a moment her face glowed with its look of former tenderness, but it grew grim again very quickly as she went on: ""But 'im! Not 'im! She was deeply stirred by this imagined threat to the ascendancy of her idol. Her lips worked tremulously, then she shook her head with a quick movement of inflexible denial and said: ""Not 'im. She was silent for a moment more, as if a struggle were going on between her desire to speak and the cool barrier of her natural reserve. Then she burst out: ""I tell you, sir, I never liked the look of 'im! Not that one--no! She shook her head again in a half-convulsive movement; then, in a tone of dark confidingness, she almost whispered: ""There's somethin' sly about 'is face that I don't like! ' E's a sly one, 'e is, but 'e don't fool me! Her face was now deeply flushed, and she nodded her head with the air of a person who had uttered her grim and final judgment and would not budge from it. That's my opinion, if you ask me, sir! That's the way I've always felt about 'im. And 'er. ' Er! She wouldn't like it, would she? Not 'arf she wouldn't! She laughed suddenly, the bitter and falsetto laugh of an angry woman. Not 'er! Why, it's plain as clay, it's written all over 'er! But a lot of good it'll do 'em,"" she said grimly. We know what's what! She shook her head again with grim decision. The people know. They can't be fooled. So let 'em git along with it!""  ""You don't think, then, that they----""  ""Them!"" said Mrs. Purvis strongly.",1
4815,"Them! Not in a million years, sir! Never! Never!...'E""--her voice fairly soared to a cry of powerful conviction--""'E's the one! ' E's always been the one! And when the time comes, sir, 'E--'E will be King!",1
4817,"'E's the one that 'as the rascal in 27. Ah-h, and 'e is a rascal, too,"" she cried, shaking her head and laughing with affectionate remembrance. Big, shaggy fellow 'e is, you know, comin' along, swingin' 'is big shoulders, and looking' as if butter wouldn't melt in 'is mouth. 'E is a rascal. George was a little bewildered by this time and asked her if she meant the gentleman or the dog.",1
4820,"It seems I must 'ave seen 'er before, but I can't be sure. But I will just keep my eyes open and I'll let you know if I find out where she lives. A few days later Mrs. Purvis came in from her morning's shopping tour, beaming with satisfaction and full of news.",1
4822,"The girl you asked about the other day,"" said Mrs. Purvis. The one you pointed out to me. Oh yes,"" he said, getting up.",1
4823,"And what about her? Does shelive here in the street? Of course,"" said Mrs. Purvis.",1
4833,"One hardly notices them at first. But then, one day, the Little People swarm up to the surface of the earth, and for the first time one sees them. That is the way the revelation came to George Webber, and it was an astounding discovery. It was like a kind of terrible magic to realise suddenly that he had been living in this English world and seeing only one part of it, thinking it was the whole. It was not that the Little People were few in number. Once he saw them, they seemed to be almost the whole population. They outnumbered the Big People ten to one. And after he saw them, he knew that England could never look the same to him again, and that nothing he might read or hear about the country thereafter would make sense to him if it did not take the Little People into account.",1
4835,"He wore a greasy, threadbare little jacket, tightly buttoned, from the sleeves of which his raw wrists and large, grimy, work-reddened hands protruded with almost indecent nakedness. His trousers, tight as a couple of sausage skins, were equally greasy and threadbare, and were inches too short for him. His old and broken shoes were several sizes too big, and from the battered look of them they must have helped to round the edges of every cobble-stone in stony-hearted London. This costume was completed by a shapeless old hulk of a cap, so large and baggy that it slopped over on one side of his head and buried the ear.",1
4837,"This grotesque little creature even spoke a different language. It was Cockney, of course, but not sharp, decisive Cockney; it was a kind of thick, catarrhal jargon, so blurred in the muttering that it was almost indecipherable. George could hardly understand him at all. Mrs. Purvis could make better sense of it, but even she confessed that there were times when she did not know what he was talking about. George would hear her beginning to rail at him the instant he came staggering into the house beneath the weight of a heavy case of beer:  ""'Ere, now, mind where you're goin', won't you?",1
4851,"George had never met Mr. Lloyd McHarg. He had never had occasion to communicate with him in any way. He knew him only through his books. He was, of course, one of the chief figures in American letters, and now, at the zenith of his career, when he had won the greatest ovation one could win, he had seized the occasion, which most men would have employed for purposes of self-congratulation, to praise enthusiastically the work of an obscure young writer who was a total stranger to him and who had written only one book.",1
4858,"After that they waited daily for McHarg's coming. Week lengthened into week. They searched the papers every morning for news of him. He seemed to be making a tour of Europe, and everywhere he went he was entertained and feted and interviewed and photographed in the company of other famous men. Now he was in Copenhagen. Now he was staying in Berlin a week or two. Later he had gone to Baden-Baden for a cure.",1
4859,"Oh Lord! George groaned dismally. How long does that take?""  Again he was in Amsterdam; and then silence.",1
4861,"One morning about the middle of January, after George had worked all night, and now, in bed, was carrying on his usual chat with Mrs. Purvis, he had just spoken of McHarg's long-deferred arrival rather hopelessly--when the phone rang. Mrs. Purvis went into the sitting-room and answered it. George could hear her saying formally:  ""Yes.",1
4862,"Who shall I say? Who's callin', please? A waiting silence. Then, rather quickly: ""Just a moment, sir. She entered George's room, her face flushed, and said: ""Mr. Lloyd Mc'Arg is on the wire. To say that George got out of bed would be to give a hopelessly inadequate description of a movement which hurled him into the air, bedclothes and all, as if he had been shot out of a cannon.",1
4864,"His voice, rapid, feverish, somewhat nasal and high-pitched, unmistakably American, stabbed nervously across the wire and said:  ""Hello, hello. Is that you, George? He called him by his first name immediately. How are you, son? How are you, boy? How are they 'treating you?""  ""Fine, Mr. McHarg!",1
4867,"That's what I was just about to say!""--laughing idiotically. Say, Mr. McHarg, when can we----""  ""Now wait a minute, wait a minute! Let me do the talking. Don't get so excited. Now listen, George! His voice had the staccato rapidity of a telegraph ticker. Even though one bad never seen him, one would have got instantly an accurate impression of his feverishly nervous vitality, wire-taut tension, and incessant activity. Now listen! he barked. I want to see you and talk to you. We'll have lunch together and talk things over. Fine!",1
4868,"F-fine! George stuttered. I'll be delighted! Any time you say. I know you're busy. I can meet you to-morrow, next day, Friday--next week if that suits you better. Next week, hell 1"" he rasped.",1
4876,"We was 'avin' gammon and peas again to-day. Ah-h, a prime bit, too. I 'ad just put 'em on when 'e called. Well, I hate to miss them, Mrs. Purvis,"" George called back, as he struggled into his trousers.",1
4879,"Meetin' all them artists and members of the nobility. Probably fed up with it, I should think,"" she said. I know I should be,"" which meant that she would have given only her right eye for the opportunity. You might take 'im to Simpson's, you know,"" she said in the offhand manner that usually accompanied her most important contributions.",1
4883,"Excuse me, sir,"" she said, setting the shoes down. But you do 'ave a way of puffin' things. I 'ave to larf sometimes...1 Still, in Simpson's--you won't go wrong in Simpson's, you know,"" said Mrs. Purvis, who had never seen any of these places in her whole life. If 'e likes mutton--ah-h, I tell you what,"" she said with satisfaction, ""you do get a prime bit of mutton there. He put on his shoes and noted that only ten minutes had passed since Mr. McHarg hung up.",1
4885,"It was one of those old, black, hearselike contraptions with a baggage rack on top which, to an American, used to the gaudy, purring thunderbolts of the New York streets, seem like Victorian relics, and which are often, indeed, driven by elderly Jehus with walrus moustaches who were driving hansom cabs at the time of Queen Victoria's jubilee. This ancient vehicle now rolled sedately towards him, on the wrong side of the street as usual--which is to say, on the right side for the English. George opened the door, gave the walrus the address, and told him to make haste, that the occasion was pressing. He said: ""Very good, sir,"" with courteous formality, wheeled the old crate round, and rolled sedately up the street again at exactly the same pace, which was about twelve miles an hour. They passed the grounds of Buckingham Palace, wheeled into the Mall, turned up past St. James's Palace into Pall Mall, thence into St. James's Street, and in a moment more drew up before McHarg's address.",1
4890,"The first and most violent impression was his astonishing redness. Everything about him was red--hair, large protuberant ears, eyebrows, eyelids, even his bony, freckled, knuckly hands. (As George noticed the hands he understood why everyone who knew him called him ""Knuckles"".) Moreover, it was a most alarming redness. His face was so red that it seemed to throw off heat, and if at that moment smoke had begun to issue from his nostrils and he had burst out in flames all over, George would hardly have been surprised.",1
4891,"His face did not have that fleshy and high-coloured floridity that is often seen in men who have drunk too long and too earnestly. It was not like that at all. McHarg was thin to the point of emaciation. He was very tall, six feet two or three, and his excessive thinness and angularity made him seem even taller. George thought he looked ill and wasted. His face, which was naturally a wry, puckish sort of face--as one got to know it better, a pugnacious but very attractive kind of face, full of truculence, but also with an impish humour and a homely, Yankee, freckled kind of modesty that were wonderfully engaging--this face now looked as puckered up as if it were permanently about to swallow a half-green persimmon, and it also seemed to be all dried out and blistered by the fiery flames that burned in it. And out of this face peered two of the most remarkable-looking eyes in all the world. Their colour must originally have been light blue, but now they were so bleached and faded that they looked as if they had been poached.",1
4902,"He glared at Bendien with his flaming face, then, throwing up his bony hands with a quick, spasmodic movement, he cried: ""Oh, for God's sake! He turned and began to pace up and down again, muttering: ""Too much--too much--too--too--too much. Then abruptly, in a voice shrill with irritation: ""Let him drink what he wants, for Christ's sake! Go ahead, Georgie,"" he said roughly. Drink what you like. Pour yourself some Scotch. And suddenly turning to Webber, his whole face lighting up with an impish smile, his lips flickering nervously above his teeth: ""Isn't it wonderful, Georgie? Isn't it marvellous? K-k-k-k-k""--prodding Webber in the ribs with bony forefinger, and laughing a high, dry, feverish laugh--""Can you beat it?""  ""I confess,"" said Mr. Donald Stoat at this point, with rotund unction, ""that I have not read our young friend's opus, which, I believe""--unction here deepening visibly into rotund sarcasm--""which, I believe, has been hailed by certain of our cognoscenti as a masterpiece.",1
4904,"McHarg was obviously becoming more and more annoyed, and kept pacing up and down, muttering to himself. Mr. Stoat, however, was too obtuse by nature, and too entranced by the rolling cadences of his own rhetoric, to observe the warning signals. After leering significantly with his eyebrows again, he went on:  ""I can only hope, however, that our young friend here is a not too enthusiastic devotee of the masters of what I shall call The School of Bad Taste.",1
4908,"I absolutely agree with you. Mr. Stoat, who had been very much on his dignity up to now, thawed visibly under the seducing cajolery of this unexpected confrrmation of his literary judgment. You are positively and unanswerably correct,"" said Knuckles, now standing in the middle of the room with his long legs spread wide apart, his bony hands hanging to the lapels of his coat. You have hit the nail right smack--dead--square on the top of its head. As he uttered these words, he jerked his wry face from side to side to give them added emphasis. There has never been a dirtier--filthier--more putrid--and more corrupt writer than George Moore. And as for that book of his, Ulysses,"" McHarg shouted, ""that is unquestionably the vilest----""  ""--the rottenest----"" shouted Mr. Stoat----  ""--the most obscene----"" shrilled McHarg----  ""--the most vicious----"" panted Mr. Stoat----  ""--unadulterated----""  ""--piece of tripe----"" choked Mr. Stoat with rapturous agreement----  ""--tha t has ever polluted the pages, defiled the name, and besmirched the record----""  ""--of English literature!"" gasped Mr. Stoat happily, and paused, panting for breath.",1
4917,"George had first had his attention called to this phenomenon by an observation of H. L. Mencken. In his extraordinary work on the American language, Mencken gave an example of the American sporting writers' jargon--""Babe Smacks Forty-second with Bases Loaded""--and pointed out that such a headline would be as completely meaningless to an Oxford don as the dialect of some newly discovered tribe of Eskimos. True enough; but what shocked George to attention when he read it was that Mencken drew the wrong inference from his fact. The headline would be meaningless to the Oxford don, not because it was written in the American language, but because the Oxford don had no knowledge of baseball. The same headline might be just as meaningless to a Harvard professor, and for the same reason.",1
4920,"Throughout all the years of his life, George Webber had been soaking up experience like a sponge. This process never ceased with him, but within the last few years he had noticed a change in it. Formerly, in his insatiable hunger to know everything--to see all the faces in a crowd at once, to remember every face that passed him on a city street, to hear all the voices in a room and through the vast, perplexing blur to distinguish what each was saying--he had often felt that he was drowning in some vast sea of his own sensations and impressions. But now he was no longer so overwhelmed by Amount and Number. He was growing up, and out of the very accumulation of experience he was gaining an essential perspective and detachment. Each new sensation and impression was no longer a single, unrelated thing: it took its place in a pattern and sifted down to form certain observable cycles of experience. Thus his incessantly active mind was free to a much greater degree than ever before to remember, digest, meditate, and compare, and to seek relations between all the phenomena of living. The result was an astonishing series of discoveries as his mind noted associations and resemblances, and made recognitions not only of surface similarities but of identities of concept and of essence.",1
4928,"He was obviously the kind of man who would have found an instant and congenial place for himself among his fellow business men in Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, or Kalamazoo. He would have felt completely at home at one of the weekly luncheons of the Rotary Club. He would have chewed his cigar with the best of them, wagged his head approvingly as the president spoke of some member as having ""both feet on the ground"", entered gleefully into all the horseplay, the heavy-handed kind of humour known as ""kidding"", and joined in the roars of laughter that greeted such master-strokes of wit as collecting all the straw hats in the cloak-room, bringing them in, throwing them on the floor, and gleefully stamping them to pieces. He would also have nodded his red face in bland agreement as the speaker aired again all the quackery about ""service"", ""the aims of Rotary"", and its ""plans for world peace"".",1
4932,"And what disillusionment, what disappointment, was this? It was a disappointment that all men know--the artist most of all--The disappointment of reaching for the flower and having it fade the moment your fingers touch it. It was the disappointment that comes from the artist's invincible and unlearning youth, from the spirit of indomitable hope and unwavering adventure, the spirit that is defeated and cast down ten thousand times but that is lost beyond redemption never, the spirit that, so far from learning wisdom from despair, acceptance from defeat, cynicism from disillusionment, seems to grow stronger at every rebuff, more passionate in its convictions the older it grows, more assured of its ultimate triumphant fulfilment the more successive and conclusive its defeats.",1
4939,"Mr. Stoat met him at the door and with a pontifical flourish of the eyebrows led him into the presence of Cornelia Fosdick Sprague. After he had made his obeisances Mr. Stoat piloted the young man about the room and with repeated flourishes of the eyebrows introduced him to the other guests. There was an astonishing number of formidable-looking females, and, like the imposing Cornelia, most of them had three names. As Mr. Stoat made the introductions he fairly smacked his lips over the triple-barrelled sonority of their titles.",1
4943,What was he doing here? What on earth did it mean? George did not have to wait long for an answer. The telephone rang. McHarg snapped his fingers sharply and sprang for the instrument with an exclamation of overwrought relief.,1
4945,"A vision of the illimitable seas passed through his mind. He remembered storms that he had been in and the way great ships were tossed about; he thought of the enormous curve of the earth's surface and of the difference in time; and yet in a moment McHarg, his voice calm now, began to speak quietly as if he were talking to someone in the next room: Oh, hello Wilson,"" he said. Yes, I can hear you perfectly. Of course... Yes, yes, it's true. Of course it is! he cried, with a return to his former manner of feverish annoyance. No, I've broken with him completely... No, I don't know where I'm going. I haven't signed up with anyone yet... All right, all right,"" impatiently. Wait a minute,"" he said curtly. Let me do the talking. I won't do anything until I see you... No that's not a promise to go with you,"" he said angrily. It's just a promise that I won't go anywhere else till I see you. A moment's pause while McHarg listened intently. You're sailing when?...Oh, to-night! The Berengaria. Good. I'll see you here then next week... All right. Good-bye, Wilson,"" he snapped, and hung up.",1
4951,"Sit down, sit down! McHarg gasped, and fell into a chair. He crossed his bony legs with a curiously pathetic and broken attitude. Christ! he said, letting out a long sigh, ""I'm tired. I feel as if I've been run through a sausage grinder. That damned Dutchman! I went out with him in Amsterdam, and we've been going it ever since. God, I can't remember having eaten since I left Cologne. That was four days ago. He looked it, too.",1
4954,"The address was in Surrey, a farm on a country road several miles away from a small town. The directions for finding it were quite complicated, involving detours and cross-roads, but George finally got it all down correctly. Then McHarg, feverishly assuring his host that they would be there for dinner, with time to spare, hung up.",1
4955,"Well, now,"" he said impatiently, springing to his feet with another exhibition of that astounding vitality which seemed to burn in him all the time, ""come on, Georgie! Let's snap out of it! We'll have to get going!""  ""W-w-w-we?",1
4959,"George's heart sank. He had not bargained for anything like this. He had come to England to finish his new book. The work had been going well. He had established the beat and cadence of daily hours at his writing, and the prospect of breaking the rhythm of it just when he was going at full swing was something that he dreaded. Moreover, God only knew where such a jaunt as McHarg spoke of would end. McHarg, meanwhile, was still talking, pacing nervously back and forth and letting his enthusiasm mount as his mind built up the idyllic picture of what he had suddenly taken it into his head to do.",1
4967,"Tell him I'll need him. Tell him we'll be ready in twenty minutes. He tore out the cheque and handed it to the man. And by the way,"" he said, ""when you come back will you pack some things--shirts, underwear, socks, and so on--in a small bag? We're going out of town. Very good, sir,"" John said quietly, and went out.",1
4970,"That's the stuff,"" he said. Go to it and give 'em people,"" he said quietly. You've got the feeling for 'ern. You know how to make 'em live. Go on and put 'em in. You'll hear a lot of bunk,"" he went on. You've probably heard it already. There'll be a lot of bright young men who will tell you how to write, and tell you that what you do is wrong. They'll tell you that you have no style, no sense of form. They'll tell you that you don't write like Virginia Woolf, or like Proust, or like Gertrude Stein, or like someone else that you ought to write like. Take it all in, as much of it as you can. Believe all of it that you're able to believe. Try to get all the help from it you can, but if you know it's not true, don't pay too much attention to it. Will you be able to know whether it's true or not?""  ""Oh, yes,"" he said quietly.",1
4973,"I don't think you will, either. So get going. Keep busy. For Christ's sake, don't freeze up. Don't stall around. I've known a lot of young fellows who froze up after their first book, and it wasn't because they had only that one book in them, either. That's what the bright young men thought. That's what they always think, but it just ain't true. Good God, man, you've got a hundred books in you! You can keep on turning them out as long as you live. There's no danger of your drying up. The only danger is of freezing up. How do you mean?",1
4976,"I think you will find these right, sir,"" he said, as he handed the money to McHarg. I counted them. One 'undred pounds, sir.""  McHarg took the notes, folded them into a wad, and thrust it carelessly into his pocket.",1
4982,"It was well after one o'clock when they started off. They rolled smoothly into St. James's Street, turned at the bottom into Pall Mall, went round St. James's Palace and into the Mall, and headed towards Buckingham Palace and Webber's own part of town. Coming out of the Mall and wheeling across the great place before the palace, McHarg roused himself with a jerk, peered through the drizzle and the reek--it was a dreary day--at the magnificent sentries stamping up and down in front of the palace, stamping solemnly, facing at the turns, and stamping back again, and was just about to slump back when George caught him up sharply.",1
4983,"At that moment Ebury Street was very near, and it seemed very dear to him. George thought with desire and longing of his bed, of Mrs. Purvis, and of his untouched gammon and peas. That morning's confident departure already seemed to be something that had happened long ago. He smiled bitterly as he remembered his conversation with Mrs. Purvis and their speculations about whether Mr. McHarg would take him to lunch at the Ritz, or at Stone's in Panton Street, or at Simpson's in the Strand. Gone now were all these Lucullan fantasies. At that point he would joyfully have compromised on a pub and a piece of cheese and a pint of bitter beer.",1
4984,"As the car wheeled smoothly past the palace, he felt his last hope slipping away. Desperately he jogged his companion by the elbow before it should be too late and told him he lived just round the corner in Ebury Street, and could he please stop off a moment there to get a tooth-brush and a safety-razor, that it would take only a minute. McHarg meditated this request gravely and finally mumbled that he could, but to ""make it snappy"". Accordingly, George gave the driver the address, and they drove down round the palace, turned into Ebury Street, and slowed down as they approached his modest little house. McHarg was beginning to look desperately ill. He hung on grimly to his strap, but when the car stopped he swayed in his seat and would have gone down if George had not caught him.",1
4985,"Mr. McHarg,"" George said, ""you ought to have something to eat before we go on farther. Won't you come upstairs with me and let the woman give you something? She has fixed me a good lunch. It's all ready. We could eat and be out again in twenty minutes. No food,"" he muttered and glared at George suspiciously.",1
4988,"He stood at the open door, with one foot upon the running-board. McHarg made no answer; he lay back against the seat with his eyes closed. But a moment later he tugged on the strap, pulled himself partly erect, and, with just a shade of obstinate concession, said:  ""You got a cup of tea up there?""  ""Of course.",1
5000,"Later he was faintly conscious that Mrs. Purvis had come softly in, had put his feet upon a chair, and had spread a blanket over him. He was also dimly aware that she had drawn the curtains, darkened the room, and gone softly out. Later still, as she prepared to leave for the day, George heard her open the door and listen for a moment; then, very quietly, she tiptoed across the floor and opened the bedroom door and peered in. Evidently satisfied that all was well, she tiptoed out again, closing the doors gently as she went. He heard her creep softly down the stairs, and presently the street door closed. He fell asleep again and slept soundly for some time.",1
5008,"And come back here in five minutes. I'll be able to tell you then what we're going to do. Very good, sir.",1
5009,"He inclined his head in a brief nod of agreement, put on his cap, and got into his car. George closed the door and went back up the stairs. When he entered the sitting-room, McHarg had on his overcoat and hat and was pacing restlessly up and down.",1
5011,"McHarg shrilled. We're going to get a move on! Christ Almighty, man, we're four hours late already! Come on, come on, George! he rasped. Let's get going!",1
5015,"The enormous ganglia of unending London rolled past them--street after street wet with a dull gleam of rain-fogged lamps, mile after mile of brick houses, which seemed steeped in the fog and soot and grime of uncounted days of dismal weather, district after district in the interminable web, a giant congeries of uncounted villages, all grown together now into this formless, monstrous sprawl. They would pass briefly through the high streets of these far-flung warrens. For a moment there would be the golden nimbus of the fog-blurred lights, the cheerful radiance of butcher shops, with the red brawn of beef, the plucked plumpness and gangling necks of hung fowls, and the butchers in their long white aprons; then the wine and liquor stores, and the beer-fogged blur and warmth and murmur of the pubs, with the dull gleam of the rain-wet pavement stretching out in front; then pea-soup darkness again, and again the endless rows of fog-cheat houses.",1
5016,"At last they began to come to open country. There was the darkness of the land, the smell of the wet fields, the strung spare lights of night across the countryside. They began to feel the force of the wind as it swooped down at them across the fields and shivered against the sides of the car. It was blowing the fog away and the sky was lifting. And now, against the damp, low, thick, and dismal ceiling of the clouds, there was an immense corrupted radiance, as if all the swelter, smoke, and fury of London's unending life had been caught up and resumed there. With every revolution of the wheels the glow receded farther behind them.",1
5024,"McHarg demanded truculently. Because, sir,"" said the driver, ""it's a good two 'undred and fifty miles, sir. In this weather, what with rain and never knowing when the fog may close in again, it would take ite all of eight hours, sir, to do it. We should not arrive there, sir, until the small hours of the morning.",1
5034,"Somewhere along the road, after they had spent hours driving back and forth and getting nowhere, McHarg's amazing reserves of energy and vitality ran completely out. He was sitting sprawled out as before, with head thrown back, when suddenly he groped blindly with a hand towards George and said:  ""I'm done in, George! Stop the car! I can't go on. George stopped the car at once.",1
5035,"There by the roadside in the darkness, in stormy wind and scudding rain, they halted. In the van and fitful light of the spectral moon McHarg's appearance was ghastly. His face now looked livid and deathlike. George was greatly alarmed and suggested that he get out of the car and see if the cold air wouldn't make him feel better.",1
5036,"McHarg answered very quietly, with the utter finality of despair. No,"" he said. I just feel as if I'd like to die. Leave me alone. He slumped back into his corner, dosed his eyes, and seemed to resign himself entirely into George's keeping. He did not speak again during the remainder of that horrible journey.",1
5037,"In the half-darkness, illuminated only by the instrument panel of the car and the eerie light of the moon, George and the driver looked at each other in mute and desperate interrogation. Presently the driver moistened his dry lips and whispered:  ""What are we to do now, sir? Where shall we go?""  George thought for a moment, then answered: ""We'll have to go back to his friend's house, I think.",1
5039,"Yes, sir! the driver whispered. He backed the car round and started off again.",1
5046,"Accordingly, George got out, took a deep breath to brace himself, and started reluctantly up the path. He felt trapped in a grotesque and agonising predicament. He had no idea whom he was going to meet. He did not even know the name of McHarg's friend. McHarg had spoken of him only as Rick, which George took to be an abbreviation or a nickname. And he could not be certain that the man lived here. All he knew was that after a day filled with incredible happenings, and a nightmarish ride in a Rolls-Royce with a terrified driver, he was now advancing up a path with rain and wind beating in his face towards a house he had never seen before to tell someone whose name he did not know that one of the most distinguished of American novelists was lying exhausted at his door, and would he please come out and see if he knew him.",1
5055,"McHarg was silent, save for his hoarse breathing, which was almost a snore. Knuck, old chap! the Englishman cried again. I say, Knuck! he cried more loudly. Are you there, old boy?""  McHarg very obviously was there, but he gave no answer.",1
5057,"Then he began to snore again. I say, Knuck! the Englishman cried with sharper insistence. Won't you get up, man? We're waiting for you at the house! There was no response except the continued heavy breathing.",1
5059,"He looks desperately ill, as if he were on the point of complete physical and nervous collapse. We'd better call a doctor, hadn't we?""  ""Ow, no,"" said the Englishman cheerfully. I've known Knuck a long time and seen this happen before when he got all keyed up. He drives himself mercilessly, you know--won't rest--won't stop to eat--doesn't know how to take care of himself. It would kill anybody else, the way he lives. But not Knuck. It's nothing to worry about, really. He'll be all right. You'll see. With this comforting assurance they helped McHarg out of the car and stood him on his feet.",1
5060,"His emaciated form looked pitifully weak and frail, but the cold air seemed to brace him up. He took several deep breaths and looked about him. That's fine,"" said the Englishman encouragingly. Feel better now, old chap? Feel Godawful,"" said McHarg.",1
5061,"All in. Want to go to bed. Of course,"" said the Englishman.",1
5064,"Whatever you say. But your friend here must be starved. We'll fix you both up. Do come along,"" he said, and took McHarg by the arm.",1
5066,"No,"" he said crisply, ""we shan't be needing it. Just drive it up behind the house, won't you, and leave it there. Yes, sir, yes, sir,"" the driver gasped.",1
5073,"It was a lovely room, low-ceilinged, warm, panelled with old wood. The lady was lovely, too. And the dinner, although it had been standing for hours, was nevertheless magnificent. While they were waiting for the soup to come on, Reade gave George a glass of fine dry Sherry, then another, and still another. The soup came in at last, served by a fellow with a big nose and a sharp, shrewd, Cockney sort of face, correctly dressed for the occasion in clean but somewhat faded livery. It was a wonderful soup, thick tomato, the colour of dark mahogany. George could not conceal his hunger. He ate greedily, and, with the evidence of that enthusiastic appetite before them all the stiffness that was left began to melt away.",1
5074,"The butler brought in an enormous roast of beef, then boiled potatoes and Brussels sprouts. Reade carved a huge slab of meat for George, and the lady garnished his platc generously with the vegetables. They ate, too, but it was evident that they had already had their dinner. They took only small portions and left their plates unfinished, but they went through the motions just to keep George company. The beef vanished from his own plate in no time at all.",1
5088,"In the warming glow of the fire and their new-found intimacy they had several more brandies, smoked endless cigarettes, and talked on and on for hours, forgetting the passage of time. It was the kind of talk which, freed of all constricting traces of self-consciousness, lets down the last barriers of natural reserve and lays bare the souls of men. George's host was in high spirits and told the most engaging stories about himself, his wife, and the good life they were making here in the isolated freedom of their rural retreat. He made it seem not only charming and attractive, full of wholesome country pleasures, but altogether desirable and enviable. It was an idyllic picture that he painted--such a picture of rugged independence, with its simple joys and solid comforts, as has at one time or another haunted the imagination of almost every man in the turmoil, confusion, and uncertainties of the complex world we live in. But as George listened to his host and felt the nostalgic attractiveness of the images that were unfolded before him, he also felt a disquieting sense of something else behind it all which never quite got into the picture, but which lent colourings of doubt and falsity to every part of it.",1
5094,"Life in the country was really full of absorbing interests which city folk knew nothing about. For one thing, there was local politics, in which they had now become passionately involved. They attended all the town meetings, became hotly partisan over the question of a new floor for the bridge across the creek, took sides against old Abner Jones, the head selectman, and in general backed up the younger, more progressive element. Over week-ends, they had the most enchanting tales to tell their ciry friends about these town meetings. They were full of stories, too, about all the natives, and could make the most sophisticated visitor howl with laughter when, after coffee and brandy in the evening, the squire and his wife would go through their two-part recital of Seth Freeman's involved squabble and lawsuit with Rob Perkins over a stone fence. One really got to know his neighbours in the country. It was a whole world in itself. Life here was simple, yet it was so good.",1
5095,"In this old farm-house they ate by candle-light at night. The pine panelling of the dining-room had been there more than two hundred years. They had not changed it. In fact, the whole front part of the house was just the same as it had always been. All they had added was the new wing for the children. Of course, they had had to do a great deal when they bought the place. It had fallen into shocking disrepair. The floors and sills were rotten and had had to be replaced. They had also built a concrete basement and installed an oil furnace. This had been costly, but it was worth the price. The people who had sold them the house were natives of the region who had gone to seed. The farm had been in that one family for five generations. It was incredible, though, to see what they had done to the house. The sitting-room had been covered with an oilcloth carpet. And in the dining-room, right beside the beautiful old revolutionary china chest, which they had persuaded the people to sell with the house, had been an atrocious gramophone with one of those old-fashioned horns. Could one imagine that?",1
5103,"Such a man, in his own way, was this Englishman, Rickenbach Reade. He was, as he confided to George later in the evening, a writer--as he himself put it, with a touch of bitter whimsey, ""a writer of sorts"". He had had a dozen books published. He took them from their shelves with a curious eagerness that was half apology and showed them to George. They were critical biographies of literary men and politicians, and were examples of the ""debunking school"" of historical writing. George later read one or two of them, and they turned out to be more or less what he had expected. They were the kind of books that debunked everything except themselves. They were the lifeless products of a padded Stracheyism: their author, lacking Strachey's wit and shirking the labours of his scholarship, succeeded at best in a feeble mimicry of his dead vitality, his moribund fatigue, his essential foppishness. So these books, dealing with a dozen different lives and periods, were really all alike, all the same--the manifestations of defeat, the jabs of an illusioned disillusion, the sceptical evocations of a fantastic and unliving disbelief.",1
5105,"Such was the tone and temper of Reade's books, and such was the quality of disbelief that had produced them. In consequence, they fooled no one except the author. They did not even have the energy of an amusing or persuasive slander. They were stillborn the moment they issued from the press. No one read them or paid any attention to them.",1
5106,"And how did he rationalise to himself his defeat and failure? In the easy, obvious, and inevitable way. He had been rash enough, he told George with a smile of faint, ironic bitterness, to expose some of the cherished figures of public worship and, with his cold, relentless probing for the truth, to shatter the false legends that surrounded them. Naturally, his reward had been anathema and abuse, the hatred of the critics and the obstinate hostility of the public. It had been a thankless business from beginning to end, so he was done with it. He had turned his back on the prejudice, bigotry, stupidity, and hypocrisy of the whole fickle and idolatrous world, and had come here to the country to find solitude and seclusion. One gathered that he would write no more.",1
5109,"McHarg lay motionless, just as they had left him. He had not stirred a muscle, but seemed to be sunk in the untroubled sleep of childhood. George spread another blanket over him. Then he undressed, turned out the lights, and crawled into his own bed.",1
5118,"They had a good lunch together. Wine was served, but McHarg partook sparingly of it. After lunch, to Webber's great relief, McHarg told him quietly that they were returning to London in the afternoon. He said nothing about the projected tour of England which he had depicted in such glowing colours the day before. Whether that had been just a passing whim, or whether he had given up the idea because he sensed George's lack of enthusiasm for it, George did not know. McHarg did not refer to it at all. He merely announced their return to London as a fact and let it go at that.",1
5122,"And now the lights were up, and there against the sky George saw again the vast corrupted radiance of the night--the smoke, the fury, and the welter of London's unending life. And after a little while the car was threading its way through the jungle warren of that monstrous sprawl, and at last it turned into Ebury Street and stopped. George got out and thanked McHarg; they shook hands, exchanged a few words, and then said good-bye. The little driver shut the door, touched his cap respectfully, and climbed back into his seat. The big car purred and drove off smoothly into the darkness.",1
5124,"The thing is just right, and cannot be improved. In that sense he was not at all satisfied with his new book. He knew its faults, knew all the places where it fell short of his intentions. But he' also knew that he had put into it everything he had at that stage of his development, and for this reason he was not ashamed of it. He delivered the bulky manuscript to Fox Edwards, and as its weight passed from his hands to Fox's he felt as if a load that he had been carrying for years had been lifted from his mind and conscience. He was done with it, and he wished to God he could forget it and never have to see a line of it again.",1
5126,"Publication was scheduled for the spring of 1936, and as the time approached he became increasingly apprehensive. When his first book had come out, wild horses could not have dragged him from New York; he had wanted to be on hand so he could be sure not to miss anything. He had waited around, and read all the reviews, and almost camped out in Fox's office, and had expected from day to day some impossible fulfilment that never came. Instead, there had been the letters from Libya Hill and his sickening adventures with the lion hunters. So now he was gun-shy of publication dates, and he made up his mind to go away this time--as far as possible away. Although he did not believe there would be an exact repetition of those earlier experiences, just the same he was prepared for the worst, and when it happened he was determined not to be there.",1
5132,"The month of May is wonderful everywhere. It was particularly wonderful in Berlin that year. Along the streets, in the Tiergarten, in all the great gardens, and along the Spree Canal the horse-chestnut trees were in full bloom. The crowds sauntered underneath the trees on the Kurfürstendamm, the terraces of the cafés were jammed with people, and always, through the golden sparkle of the days, there was a sound of music in the air. George saw the chains of endlessly lovely lakes around Berlin, and for the first time he knew the wonderful golden bronze upon the tall poles of the kiefern-trees. Before, he had visited only the south of Germany, the Rhinelands and Bavaria; now the north seemed even more enchanting.",1
5133,"He planned to stay all summer, and one summer seemed too short a time to encompass all the beauty, magic, and almost intolerable joy which his life had suddenly become, and which he felt would never fade or tarnish if only he could remain in Germany for ever. For, to cap it all, his second book was translated and brought out within a short time of his arrival, and its reception exceeded anything he had ever dared to hope for. Perhaps his being there at the time may have had something to do with it. The German critics outdid each other in singing his praises. If one called him ""the great American epic writer"", the next seemed to feel he had to improve on that, and called hiti ""the American Homer"". So now everywhere he went there were people who knew his work. His name flashed and shone. He was a famous man.",1
5135,"Fame even gave a tongue to silence, a language to unuttered speech. Fame was with him almost all the time, but even when he was alone without her, in places where he was not known and his name meant nothing, the aura which Fame had shed still clung to him and he was able to meet each new situation with a sense of power and confidence, of warmth, friendliness, and good fellowship. He had become the lord of life. There had been a time in his youth when be felt that people were always laughing at him, and he had been ill at ease with strangers and had gone to every new encounter with a chip on his shoulder. But now he was life's strong and light-hearted master, and everyone he met and talked to--writers, taxi-drivers, porters in hotels, elevator boys, casual acquaintances in trams and trains and on the street--felt at once the flood of happy and affectionate power within him, and responded to him eagerly, instinctively, with instant natural liking, as men respond to the clean and shining light of the young sun.",1
5139,"At the moment of their first meeting, George and Else had been drawn to each other. From then on, without the need of any period of transition, their lives flowed in a single channel. They spent many wonderful days together. Many too, were the nights which they filled with the mysterious enchantments of a strong and mutually shared passion. The girl became for George the ultimate reality underlying everything he thought and felt and was during that glorious and intoxicating period of his life.",1
5141,"With no past experience in such affairs, the Germans had constructed a mighty stadium which was the most beautiful and most perfect in its design that had ever been built. And all the accessories of this monstrous plant--the swimming pools, the enormous halls, the lesser stadia--had been laid out and designed with this same cohesion of beauty and of use. The organisation was superb. Not only were the events themselves, down to the minutest detail of each competition, staged and run off like clockwork, but the crowds--such crowds as no other great city has ever had to cope with, and the like of which would certainly have snarled and maddened the traffic of New York beyond hope of untangling--were handled with a quietness, order, and speed that was astounding.",1
5143,"And all through the day, from morning on, Berlin became a mighty Ear, attuned, attentive, focused on the stadium. Everywhere the air was filled with a single voice. The green trees along the Kurfürstendamm began to talk: from loud-speakers concealed in their branches an announcer in the stadium spoke to the whole city--and for George Webber it was a strange experience to hear the familiar terms of track and field translated into the tongue that Goethe used. He would be informed now that the Vorlauf was about to be run--and then the Zwischenlauf--and at length the Endlauf--and the winner:  ""Owens--Oo Ess Ah!""  Meanwhile, through those tremendous banner-laden ways, the crowds thronged ceaselessly all day long.",1
5165,"One Big Fool The time had come for George to go. He knew he had to leave, but he had kept putting it off. Twice he had booked his passage back to America and made all his preparations for departure, and twice, as the day approached, he had cancelled the arrangements.",1
5169,"It is seven 'o'clock,"" he said. All right,"" George answered. Thank you. I'm awake.",1
5173,"Someone knocked upon the door. He turned and crossed and opened it. The waiter stood there with his breakfast tray. He was a boy of fifteen, a blond-haired, solemn child with a fresh pink face. He wore a boiled shirt, and a waiter's uniform which was spotless-clean, but which had obviously been cut off and shortened down a little from the dimensions of some more mature former inhabitant. He marched in solemnly, bearing his tray before him straight towards the table in the centre of the room, stolidly uttering in a guttural and toneless voice his three phrases of English which were:  ""Goot morning, sir,"" as George opened the door  ""If you bleeze, sir,"" as he set the tray down upon the table, and then  ""Dank you ferry much, sir,"" as he marched out and turned to close the door behind him.",1
5176,"He went over to the wash-basin and switched on the light. The large and heavy porcelain bowl was indented in the wall. The wall and the floor beneath were substantial and as perfect as a small but costly bathroom. He brushed his teeth and shaved, packed all the toilet things together in a little leather case, pulled the zipper, and put it away in the old trunk. Then he dressed. By seven-twenty he was ready.",1
5182,"George said. I don't think you'll be able to do much work, feeling as you do. Wouldn't it be better if you took the day off and caught up on your sleep?""  ""Veil, zen,"" said Heilig abruptly, yet rather indifferently, ""I vill tell you somesing.",1
5184,"She's a nice girl. I'm afraid she hasn't seen much of you the last month or so. Veil, zen,"" said Heilig, as before, ""I vill tell you somesing.",1
5189,"Yes, you may still go to ze little whores. Zat's quite anozzer matter. You may go to ze little whores and perhaps zey give you somesing--a little poison. But zat is quite all right. You see, my dear shap,"" here his face puckered in a look of impish malice, and he began to speak in the tone of exaggerated and mincing refinement that characterised some of his more vicious utterances, ""I vill now tell you somesing. Under ze Dritte Reich ve are all so happy, everysing is so fine and healsy, zat it is perfectly Gott-tam dret-ful,"" he sneered. Ve may go to ze little whores in ze Kurfürstendamm. Zey vill take you to zeir rooms, or zey vill come wiz you. Yes,"" he said earnestly, nodding, ""zey vill come wiz you to vhere you live--to your room. But you cannot haf a girl. If you haf a girl you must marry her, and--may I tell you? he said frankly--""I cannot marry. I do not make enough money. It vould be quite impossible! he said decisively. And may I tell you zis?"" he continued, pacing nervously up and down and taking rapid puffs at his cigarette. If you haf a girl, zen you must haf two rooms. And zat also is quite impossible! I haf not efen money enough to afford two rooms. You mean, if you are living with a girl you are compelled by law to have two rooms?""  ""It is ze law, yes,"" said Heilig quietly, nodding with the air of finality with which a German states established custom.",1
5191,"But if they find, Franz, that you're living with her in a single room?""  ""Veil, zen,"" he said quietly, ""I may tell you zat she vill haf to go. And then, wearily, dismissingly, in a tone of bitter indifference: ""It does not matter. I do not care. I pay no attention to zese stupid people. I haf my vork, I haf my girl. And zat is all zat matters. Ven I am finished wiz my vork, I go home to my little room. My girl is zere, and zis little dog,"" he said, and his face lighted up gleefully again. Zis little dog--may I tell you somesing?--zis little dog--Pooki--ze little Scottie zat you know--I haf become quite fond of him. He is really quite nice,"" said Heilig earnestly. Ven he first came to us I hated him. My girl saw him and she fall in love wiz zis little animal,"" said Heilig. She said zat she must haf him--zat I must be buying him for her. Veil, zen,"" said Heilig, quickly flipping the ash from his cigarette and moving up and down the room, ""I said to her zat I vill not haf zis Gott-tam little beast about my place. He fairly shouted these words to show the emphasis of his intention. Veil, zen, ze girl cry. She talk alvays about zis little dog. She say zat she must haf him, zat she is going to die. Gott! he cried gleefully again, and laughed. It vas perfectly dret-ful. Zere vas no more peace for me. I vould go home at night and instantly she vould begin to cry and say she vill be dying if I do not buy zis little dog. So finally I say: 'All right, haf it your own vay. I vill buy zis little animal!' he said viciously--""'Only for Gott's sake, shut your crying!' So, zen,"" said Heilig impishly, ""I vent to buy zis little dog, and I looked at him. Here his voice became very droll, and with a tremendous sense of comic exaggeration his eyes narrowed, his small face puckered to a grimace, and his discoloured teeth gritted together as he snarled softly and gleefully: ""I looked at zis little dog and I said--'All right, you--you-u-u buh-loody little animalyou-u-u aww-ful--dret-ful--little bee-e-e-st--I vill take you home wiz me--but you--you-u-u damned little beast, you'""--here he gleefully and viciously shook his fist at an imaginary dog--""'if you do some sings I do not like--if you viii be making some buh-loody awful messes in my place, I vill give you somesing to eat zat you will not enchoy'... But zen,"" said Heilig, ""after ve had him, I became quite fond of him. He is quite nice, really. Sometime ven I come home at night and everysing has gone badly and zere haf been so many of zese dret-ful people, he vill come and look at me. He vill talk to me. He vill say he knows zat I am so unhappy. And zat life is very hard. But zat he is my friend. Yes, he is really very nice. I like him very much. During this conversation the porter had come in and was now waiting for his orders.",1
5193,"Satisfied on this score, the porter closed the heavy trunk, locked it, and tightened the straps, while Heilig helped George stuff manuscripts, letters, and a few books into the old brief-case. Then George fastened the brief-case and gave it to the porter. He dragged the baggage out into the hall and said he would wait for them below.",1
5200,"It vould be quite dret-ful if you did not. He looked at George searchingly again, but George said nothing. In a moment Heilig said: ""And I--I shall hope zat ve shall meet again. I hope so, too, Franz,"" said George.",1
5201,"And then, trying to throw off the sadness that had fallen on them, he went on as cheerfully as he could, voicing his desire more than his belief: ""Of course we shall. I shall come back some day, and we shall sit together talking just the same as we are now. Heilig did not answer immediately.",1
5202,"His small face became contorted with the look of bitter and malicious humour which George had seen upon it so often. He took off his glasses quickly, polished them, wiped his tired, weak eyes, and put his glasses on again. You sink so?"" he said, and smiled his wry and bitter smile.",1
5204,"But I am not so sure,"" said Heilig quietly. I may not be here. You!",1
5206,"He puffed at his cigarette, and then continued rather hesitantly. You see--zere are zese fools--zese stupid people! He ground his cigarette out viciously in the ashtray, and, his face twisted in a wry smile of defiant, lacerated pride, he cried angrily: ""Myself--I do not care. I do not vorry for myself. Right now I haf my little life--my little chob--my little girl--my little room. Zese people--zese fools! he cried--""I do not notice zem. I do not see zem. It does not bozzer me,"" he cried. And now, indeed, his face had become a grotesque mask. I shall always get along,"" he said. If zey run me out--yell, zen, I may tell you zat I do not care! Zere are ozzer places! he cried bitterly. I can go to England, to Sveden. If zey take my chob, my girl,"" he cried scornfully and waved his hand impatiently, ""may I tell you zat it does not matter. I shall get along. And if zese fools--zese stupid people--if zey take my life--I do not sink zat is so terrible. You sink so? Yes?""  ""Yes, I do think so, Franz.",1
5211,"George cried, and stared at him in stupefaction. You don't mean to tell me that--why, you're not a Jew,"" he said, ""are you?""  ""Oh Gott no! Heilig cried, with a sudden shout of gleeful desperation. My dear shap, I am so Gott-tam Cherman zat it is perfectly dret-ful. Well, then,"" George demanded, puzzled, ""what's the trouble?",1
5215,"He is living?""  ""But of gourse,"" said Heilig. He is living in Berlin. Do you ever see him?""  ""But of gourse,"" he said again.",1
5218,"Only, I cannot tell him. You see,"" he went on quietly, ""my fazzer and I are quite good friends. Ve never speak about zis sing togezzer--ze vay he knew my mozzer. And now, I vould not ask him--I vould not tell him of zis trouble--I vould not vant him to help me--because it might seem zat I vas taking an adwantage. It might spoil everysing. But your father--is he known here?",1
5221,"I'm so sorry, Franz,"" George said. So damned sorry. I never knew of this. Vell, zen,"" said Heilig indifferently, ""I may tell you zat it does not matter.",1
5224,"I don't mean wiz zese fools, zese stupid people, but wiz ze people left who still read books. I may tell you,"" he said earnestly, ""zat you have ze best name here now of any foreign writer. If you should spoil it now--if you should write some sings now zat zey vould not like--it vould be a pity. Ze Reichschriftskammer vould forbid your books--vould tell us zat ve could no longer read you--and ve could not get your books. And zat vould be a pity. Ve do so like you here--I mean ze people who understand. Zey know so vell about you. Zey understand ze vay you feel about sings. And I may tell you zat ze translations are quite marvellous. Ze man who does zem is a poet, and he luffs you--he gets you in, ze vay you feel--your images--ze rhythmus of your writing. And ze people find it very vonderful. Zey cannot believe zat zey are reading a translation. Zey say zat it must haf been written in Cherman in ze beginning. And-0 Gott! he shouted gleefully again--""zey call you everysing--ze American Homer, ze American epic writer. Zey like and understand you so much. Your writing is so full of juice, so round and full of blood. Ze feeling is like feeling zat ve haf. Wiz many people you haf ze greatest name of any writer in ze world to-day. That's a good deal more than I've got at home, Franz.",1
5225,"I know. But zen, I notice, in America zey lull everyvun a year--and zen zey spit upon him. Here, wiz many people you haf zis great name,"" he said earnestly, ""and it vould be too dret-ful--it vould be such a pity--if you spoil it now. You vill not?"" he said, and again looked anxiously and earnestly at George.",1
5235,"No, I do not sink zat zey are all fakes. And Kommunismus""--he shrugged his shoulders--""vell, zen, I sink zat it is very good. I sink zat some day ze vorld may live like zat. Only, I do not sink zat you and I will see it. It is too great a dream. And zese sings are not for you. You are not one of zese little propaganda Party people--you are a writer. It is your duty to look around you and to write about ze vorld and people as you see zem. It is not your duty to write propaganda speeches and call zem books. You could not do zat. It is quite impossible. But suppose I write about the world and people as I see them, and come in conflict with the Party--what then?""  ""Zen,"" he said roughly, ""you vill be one big fool.",1
5237,"You sink it vould be better if zere vas anozzer party, like in America? Zen,"" he said, not waiting for an answer, ""I sink you are mistaken. It is bad here, of gourse, but I sink it vill be soon no better wiz you. Zese bloody fools--you find zem everyvhere. Zey are ze same wiz you, only in a different vay. Suddenly he looked at George earnestly and searchingly. You sink zat you are free in America--no? He shook his head and went on: ""I do not sink so. Ze only free ones are zese dret-ful people. Here, zey are free to tell you vhat you must read, vhat you must believe, and I sink zat is also true in America. You must sink and feel ze vay zey do--you must say ze sings zey vant you to say--or zey kill you. Ze only difference is zat here zey haf ze power to do it. In America zey do not haf it yet, but just vait--zey vill get it. Ve Chermans haf shown zem ze vay. And zen, you vould be more free here zan in New York, for here you haf a better name, I sink, zan in America. Here zey admire you. Here you are American, and you could efen write and say sings zat no Cherman could do, so long as you say nozzing zat is against ze Party. Do you sink zat you could do zat in New York?""  He paced the floor in silence for a long moment, pausing to look searchingly at George.",1
5250,"Else, you have met Herr Heilig, haven't you? Franz, you remember Frau von Kohler? Else turned and surveyed Heilig coldly and sternly.",1
5255,I sink zat you are very stupid. Ze drawing vas egg-zellent--everybody sought so. Grauschmidt himself said zat it vas vun of ze very best zat he has effer done. He likes it very much. But natürlich!,1
5257,"If I may tell you somesing----"" he began. But Else now could not be checked. She took a short and angry step away, then turned again, with two spots of passionate colour in her cheeks:  ""Your friend, Herr Grauschmidt,"" she continued, ""likes to talk of art.",1
5260,"Zese bloody people! Heilig grated. 0 Gott, but zey are dretful! Turning to George, he said venomously: ""If I may tell you somesing--zis person--zis voman--zis von Kohler zat you like so much--she iss a fool! Wait a minute, Franz.",1
5264,"He is so jealous for you. He wants to keep you for himself. He has told you lies. He has tried to say things against me. I hear them! she went on excitedly. People come to me with them! I do not listen to them! she cried angrily. 0 George, George! she said suddenly, and took him by the arms. Do not listen to this bitter little man. Last night,"" she whispered, ""I had a strange dream. It was a so strange, a so good and wonderful dream that I had for you. You must not listen to this bitter man! she cried earnestly, and shook him by the arms. You are religious man. You are artist. And the artist is religious man. Just then Lewald appeared on the platform and came towards them.",1
5271,"I alzo! he repeated. But me--I alvays haf time for mein friends,"" he said accusingly, still beating away on George's arm to show that his pretended hurt had not really gone very deep.",1
5280,"Heilig's only answer was to continue looking at him coldly and suspiciously. Lewald, however, was not in the least put out by the unappreciativeness of his audience. He turned back to George with a comical shrug, as if the whole thing were quite beyond him, and then slipped into George's pocket a small flask of German brandy, saying that it was the gift his ""hosband"" had sent. Next he took out a thin and beautifully bound little volume which one of his authors had written and illustrated. He held it in his hand and fingered through it lovingly.",1
5289,"And now the city was left behind. Those familiar faces, forms, and voices of just six minutes past now seemed as remote as dreams, imprisoned there as in another world--a world of massive brick and stone and pavements, a world hived of four million lives, of hope and fear and hatred, of anguish and despair, of love, of cruelty and devotion, that was called Berlin. And now the land was stroking past, the level land of Brandenburg, the lonely flatland of the north which he had always heard was so ugly, and which he had found so strange, so haunting, and so beautiful. The dark solitude of the forest was around them now, the loneliness of the kiefern-trees, tall, slender, towering, and as straight as sailing masts, bearing upon their tops the slender burden of their needled and eternal green. Their naked poles shone with that lovely gold-bronze colour which is like the material substance of a magic light. And all between was magic, too. The forest dusk beneath the kieferntrees was gold-brown also, the earth gold-brown and barren, and the trees themselves stood alone and separate, a polelike forest filled with haunting light.",1
5290,"Now and then the light would open and the woods be gone, and they would sweep through the level cultivated earth, tilled thriftily to the very edges of the track. He could see the clusters of farm buildings, the red-tiled roofs, the cross-quarterings of barns and houses. Then they would find the haunting magic of the woods again.",1
5296,"While George was busy with these speculations the door of the compartment opened again and a stuffy-looking little man with a long nose looked in, peered about truculently, and rather suspiciously, George thought, and then demanded to know if there was a free seat in the compartment. They all told him that they thought so. Upon receiving this information, he, too, without another word, disappeared down the corridor, to reappear again with a large valise. George helped him to stow it away upon the rack. It was so heavy that the little man could probably not have managed it by himself, yet he accepted this service sourly and without a word of thanks, hung up his overcoat, and fidgeted and worried around, took a newspaper from his pocket, sat down opposite George and opened it, banged the compartment door shut rather viciously, and, after peering round mistrustfully at all the other people, rattled his paper and began to read.",1
5297,"While he read his paper George had a chance to observe this sour-looking customer from time to time. Not that there was anything sinister about the man--decidedly there was not. He was just a drab, stuffy, irascible little fellow of the type that one sees a thousand times a day upon the streets, muttering at taxi-cabs or snapping at imprudent drivers--the type that one is always afraid he is going to encounter on a trip but hopes fervently he won't. He looked like the kind of fellow who would always be slamming the door of the compartment to, always going over and banging down the window without asking anyone else about it, always fidgeting and fuming about and trying by every crusty, crotchety, cranky, and ill-tempered method in his equipment to make himself as unpleasant, and his travelling companions as uncomfortable, as possible.",1
5305,"Old Fuss-and-Fidget arose, however, and, followed by the woman and her companion, went out on the platform for a little fresh air and exercise. George and the dapper young man in the corner were now left alone together. The latter had put down his book and was looking out of the window, but after a minute or two he turned to George and said in English, marked by a slight accent:",1
5306,"Where are we now?""  George told him they were at Hanover. I'm tired of travelling,"" the young man said with a sigh. I shall be glad when I get home. And where is home for you?",1
5307,"George asked. New York,"" he said, and, seeing a look of slight surprise on George's face, he added quickly: ""Of course I am not American by birth, as you can see from the way I talk. But I am a naturalised American, and my home is in New York. George told him that he lived there, too.",1
5308,"Then the young man asked if George had been long in Germany. All summer,"" George replied. I arrived in May. And you have been here ever since--in Germany?""  ""Yes,"" said George, ""except for ten days in the Tyrol.",1
5313,"George said. A paper--a permit--the damn thing stamped and signed which allows me to take twenty-three marks out of Germany. Twenty-three marks! he repeated scornfully--""as if I want their God-damn money!""  ""I know,"" George said.",1
5314,"You've got to get a paper every time you turn round. You have to declare your money when you come in, you have to declare it when you go out. If you send home for money, you have to get a paper for that, too. I made a little trip to Austria as I told you. It took three days to get the papers that would allow me to take my own money out. Look here! he cried, and reached in his pocket and pulled out a fistful of papers. I got all of these in one summer. The ice was broken now.",1
5318,"And George, like the other man, was weary and sick at heart, exhausted by these pressures, worn out with these tensions of the nerves and spirit, depleted by the cancer of these cureless hates which had not only poisoned the life of nations but had eaten in one way or another into the private lives of all his friends, of almost everyone that he had known here. So, like his new-found fellow countryman, he too felt, beneath the extravagance and intemperance of the man's language, a certain justice in the comparison. He was aware, as indeed the other must have been, of the huge sum of all America's lacks. He knew that all, alas, was not friendship, was not freedom, was not love beyond the Atlantic. But he felt, as his new friend must also have felt, that the essence of America's hope had not been wholly ruined, its promise of fulfilment not shattered utterly. And like the other man, he felt that it would be very good to be back home again, out of the poisonous constrictions of this atmosphere--back home where, whatever America might lack, there was still air to breathe in, and winds to clear the air.",1
5321,"They are among the best friends I have, and Mr. Edwards is my publisher. And you""--George said--""your name is Johnnie, isn't it? I have forgotten your last name, but I have heard it.",1
5325,"And now, indeed, they began to establish contact at many points. They found that they knew in common scores of people. They discussed them enthusiastically, almost joyfully. Adamowski had been away from home just one short month, and George but five, but now, like an explorer returning from the isolation of a polar voyage that had lasted several years, George eagerly demanded news of his friends, news from America, news from home.",1
5328,"Under this engaging influence, everyone began to thaw out visibly. The little blonde woman began to talk in an animated way to her young man. After a while Fuss-and-Fidget chimed in with those two, so that the whole compartment was humming with the rapid interplay of English and German.",1
5334,"But it is good and does no harm. We shall have mote.""  Pleasantly warmed by brandy, and talking together with the ease and confidence of people who had known each other for many years--for, indeed, the circumstances of their meeting and the discovery of their many common friends did give them just that feeling of old intimacy--they now began to discuss the three strangers in their compartment. The little woman--she is rather nice,"" said Adamowski, in a tone which somehow conveyed the impression that he was no novice in such appraisals. I think she is not very young, and yet, quite charming, isn't she? A personality. And the young man with her?",1
5336,"It is most curious,"" he went on in a puzzled tone. He is much younger, obviously, and not the same--he is much simpler than the lady. Yes.",1
5338,"She is very nice, and yet I think she knows a great deal more than he does. I should like to know about them,"" Adamowski went on speculatively, in the manner of a man who has a genuine interest in the world about him. These people that one meets on trains and ships--they fascinate me. You see some strange things. And these two--they interest me. I should like so much to know who they are. And the other man?",1
5341,"So his Polish friend called the waiter, asked for the bill, and paid it--and still had ten or twelve marks left of his waning twenty-three. Then they got up and went back through the speeding train to their compartment. 42. The Family of Earth The woman smiled at them as they came in, and all three of their 1 fellow-passengers looked at them in a way that showed wakened curiosity and increased interest. It was evident that George and Adamowski had themselves been subjects of speculation during their absence.",1
5342,"Adamowski now spoke to the others. His German was not very good but it was coherent, and his deficiencies did not bother him at all. He was so self-assured, so confirmed in his self-possession, that he could plunge boldly into conversation in a foreign language with no sense whatever of personal handicap. Thus encouraged, the three Germans now gave free expression to their curiosity, to the speculations which the meeting of George and Adamowski and their apparent recognition of each other had aroused.",1
5347,"All three of them thereupon looked at one another with nods of satisfaction, saying, ah, they thought so, it was evident. Old Fussand-Fidget even spoke up now, making the sage observation that it was apparent ""from the head"". The others nodded again, and the woman then turned once more to Adamowski, saying:  ""But you--you are not an artist, are you?",1
5350,"I said the same thing, didn't I? It's a small world after all, isn't it?""  Now they were all really wonderfully at ease with one another, all talking eagerly, excitedly, naturally, like old friends who had just met after a long separation. The little lady began to tell them all about herself. She and her husband, she said, were proprietors of a business near the Alexander-platz. No--smiling--the young man was not her husband. He, too, was a young artist, and was employed by her. In what sort of business? She laughed--one would never guess. She and her husband manufactured manikins for show-window displays. No, it was not a shop, exactly--there was a trace of modest pride here--it was more like a little factory. They made their own figures. Their business, she implied, was quite a large one. She said that they employed over fifty workers, and formerly had had almost a hundred. That was why she had to go to Paris as often as she could, for Paris set the fashion in manikins just as it did in clothes.",1
5353,"George added to this an account of the complications that had attended his own brief journey to the Austrian Tyrol. Ruefully he displayed the pocketful of papers, permits, visas, and official stamps which he had accumulated during the summer. Upon this common grievance they were all vociferously agreed. The lady affirmed that it was stupid, exhausting, and, for a German with business outside the country, almost impossible. She added quickly, loyally, that of course it was also necessary. But then she went on to relate that her three-or four-day trips to Paris could only be managed through some complicated trade arrangement and business connection in France, and as she tried to explain the necessary details of the plan she became so involved in the bewildering complexities of cheques and balances that she finally ended by waving her hand charmingly in a gesture of exhausted dismissal, saying:  ""Ach, Gott!",1
5359,"During the meal they discussed their companions again. They were delighted with them and immensely interested in the information they had gathered from them. The woman, they both agreed, was altogether charming. And the young man, although diffident and shy, was very nice. They even had a word of praise for old Fussand-Fidget now. After his crusty shell had been cracked, the old codger was not bad. He really was quite friendly underneath.",1
5370,"As soon as they entered the compartment they told their three German friends that the officials were already on the train and that the inspection would begin shortly. This announcement caused a flurry of excitement. They all began to get ready. The woman busied herself with her purse. She took out her passport, and then, with a worried look, began to count her money.",1
5373,"Give them to me,"" he said. She gave them to him instantly, and the money was in his pocket in the wink of an eye. Fuss-and-Fidget now counted out ten marks nervously, and without a word passed them across to George. George thrust the money in his pocket, and they all sat back, a little flushed, excited but triumphant, trying to look composed.",1
5388,"Even as they stared appalled and horror-stricken at that fatally curtained compartment, the lock clicked sharply, the door was opened and closed quickly, and an official came out. He was a burly fellow in a visored cap and a jacket of olive green--a man of forty-five or more with high, blunt cheek-bones, a florid face, and tawny moustaches combed out sprouting in the Kaiser Wilhelm way. His head was shaven, and there were thick creases at the base of his skull and across his fleshy neck. He came out, climbed down clumsily to the platform, signalled and called excitedly to another officer, and climbed back into the train again.",1
5396,"I don't know,"" she whispered. A great deal, I think. A hundred thousand marks, some say. Anyhow, they found it!",1
5397,"But how? George began. I thought everything was finished. I thought they were done with all of us when they went through the train. Yes,"" she said.",1
5399,"They all stared at one another, too stunned to say a word. Then the woman laughed in a low, frightened sort of way, a little, uncertain: ""O-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh,"" ending on a note of incredulity. This man""--she whispered again--""this little Jew----"".",1
5403,"Where are you going?"" she gasped. What are you going to do?""  ""I'm going to give the man his money. I won't see him again. I can't keep it. Her face went white.",1
5410,"You--you're not going to let him go?"" she asked hesitantly, almost in a whisper. Are--are you going to keep him here? He looked at her stolidly.",1
5415,"Then they all went back into their compartment and took their former seats. But it seemed strange and empty now. The ghost of absence sat there ruinously. The little man had left his coat and hat; in his anguish he had forgotten them. Adamowski rose and took them; and would have given them to the conductor, but the woman said:  ""You'd better look into the pockets first.",1
5418,"The young Pole shook his head. I think they would have found it if he had. He paused, peered out of the window, and thrust his his hand into his pocket. I suppose we're in Belgium now,"" he said. Here's your money. And he returned to her the twenty-three marks she had given him.",1
5421,"This is a sad ending to our trip,"" Adamowski said again, in a low voice, almost to himself. The woman tried to talk them out of their depression, to talk herself into forgetfulness. She made an effort to laugh and joke.",1
5422,"These Jews! she cried. Such things would never happen if it were not for them! They make all the trouble. Germany has had to protect herself. The Jews were taking all the money from the country. Thousands of them escaped, taking millions of marks with them. And now, when it's too late, we wake up to it! It's too bad that foreigners must see these things--that they've got to go through these painful experiences--it makes a bad impression. They don't understand the reason. But it's the Jews! she whispered.",1
5426,"Certainly they could find no reason, unless he had done it to divert suspicion from their minds about his true intent. This was Adamowski's theory, and it seemed to satisfy the woman. But George thought it more likely that the little man was in such a desperate state of nervous frenzy and apprehension that he had lost the power to reason clearly and had acted blindly, wildly, on the impulse of the moment. But they did not know. And now they would never find out the answer.",1
5429,"They had long since passed the frontier, but the woman, who had been looking musingly and a little anxiously out of the window, hailed the conductor as he passed along the corridor and asked him if they were really in Belgium now. He assured her that they were. Adamowski gave him the little man's hat and coat, and explained the reason. The conductor nodded, took them, and departed.",1
5437,"When George realised all this he began to look for atavistic yearnings in himself. He found plenty of them. Any man can find them if he is honest enough to look for them. The whole year that followed his return from Germany, George occupied himself with this effort of self-appraisal. And at the end of it he knew, and with the knowledge came the definite sense of new direction towards which he had long been groping, that the dark ancestral cave, the womb from which mankind emerged into the light, forever pulls one back--but that you can* go home again.",1
5438,"[* The 1947 UK edition was used to make this ebook. In that edition the word ""can"" appears. In another edition the word ""can't"" appears. --ebook editor.] The phrase had many implications for, him. You can't go back home to your family, back home to your childhood, back home to romantic love, back home to a young man's dreams of glory and of fame, back home to exile, to escape to Europe and some foreign land, back home to lyricism, to singing just for singing's sake, back home to aestheticism, to one's youthful idea of ""the artist"" and the all-sufficiency of ""art"" and ""beauty"" and ""love"", back home to the ivory tower, back home to places in the country, to the cottage in Bermuda, away from all the strife and conflict of the world, back home to the father you have lost and have been looking for, back home to someone who can help you, save you, ease the burden for you, back home to the old forms and systems of things which once seemed everlasting but which are changing all the time--back home to the escapes of Time and Memory.",1
5443,"But now it ends--the road we were to go together. We two alone know how completely it has ended. But before I go, because few men can ever know, from first to last, a circle of such whole, superb finality, I leave this picture of it.",1
5448,"One of the most memorable events-of my college career occurred one day at noon when I was walking up a campus path and encountered, coming towards me, one of my classmates whose name was D. T. Jones. D. T.--sometimes known more familiarly as Delirium Tremens--was also a philosopher. And the moment I saw him approaching I knew that D. T. was in the throes. He came from a family of Primitive Baptists, and he was red-haired, gaunt, and angular, and now as he came towards me everything about him--hair, eyebrows, eyelids, eyes, freckles, even his large and bony hands--shone forth in the sunlight with an excessive and almost terrifying redness.",1
5454,"The more conservative members of the magazine's staff felt that the epithet, ""thou dog"", was too strong--not that the Kaiser didn't deserve it, but that it jarred rudely upon the high moral elevation of the poem and upon the literary quality of The Burr. Over my vigorous protest, and without regard for the meter of the line, the two words were deleted. Another poem that I wrote that year was a cheerful one about a peasant in a Flanders field who ploughed up a skull, and then went on quietly about his work while the great guns blasted away and ""the grinning skull its grisly secret kept"". I also remember a short story--my first--which was called ""A Winchester of Virginia"", and was about the recreant son of an old family who recovered his courage and vindicated his tarnished honour in the charge over the top that took his life. These, so far as I can recall them, were my first creative efforts; it will be seen what an important part the last war played in them.",1
5461,"The first outburst of wrath that resulted in our disfranchisement was quickly over. Even out citizenship was quietly restored to us within three years. (As for myself, I was only eighteen when it happened, and cannot even be said to have missed a legal vote because of it.) Each of us was allowed to return to college the next year after our expulsion, and finish the full course. The sentiment of people everywhere not only softened: the verdict quickly became: ""They didn't mean to do it. They were just damned fools. Later, by the time of our re-enfranchisement, public sentiment actually became liberal in its tone of pardon. They've been punished enough,"" people said by then. They were just kids--and they didn't mean to do it. Besides""--this became an argument in our favour--""it cost a life, but it killed hazing in the state. As to the later record of the five--Randy Shepperton is dead now; but John Brackett, Stowell Anderson, and Dick Carr have all enjoyed a more than average measure of success in their communities.",1
5464,"Well, Fox, I have taken the trouble to tell you about this unrecorded incident in my life because I thought you might hear of it some time and might possibly put a strained construction on it. There were those in Libya Hill who thought it offered a reasonable and complete explanation of what had happened to me when I wrote the book. So, too, you might come to believe that it twisted and embittered me and somehow had something to do with what has happened now. With nine-tenths of your mind and heart you understand perfectly why I have to leave you, but with that remaining tenth you are still puzzled, and I can see that you will go on wondering about it. You have, from time to time, tried to reason with me about what you called, half seriously, my ""radicalism"". I don't believe there is any radicalism in me--or, if there is, it is certainly not what the word implies when you use it.",1
5471,"My father, John Webber, had been all of his life a working man. He had done hard labour with his hands since the time he was twelve years old. As I have often told you, he was a man of great natural ability and intelligence. But, like many other men who have been deprived of the advantages of formal education, he was ambitious for his son: he wanted more than anything else in the world to see me go to college. He died just before I was prepared to enter, but it was on the money he left me that I went. It is only natural that people like my father should endow formal education with a degree of practicality which it does not and should not posssess. College seemed to him a kind of magic door which not only opened to a man all the reserves of learning, but also admitted him to free passage along any high road to material success which he might choose to follow after he had passed through the pleasant academic groves. It was only natural, too, that such a man as my father should believe that this success could be most easily arrived at along one of the more familiar and more generally approved roads.",1
5473,"His bitterest regret was that the poverty of his early years had prevented him from learning any skill beyond that of a carpenter and a mason. He was a good carpenter, a good mason--in his last days he liked to call himself a builder, which indeed he was--but I think he felt in himself, like a kind of dumb and inarticulate suffering, the unachieved ability to design and shape. Certainly he would have been profoundly disappointed if he could have known what strange forms his own desires for ""doing"" and for ""making"" were to achieve in me. I cannot say what extremity--law or writing--would have filled him with the most disgust.",1
5474,"But by the time I left college it was already apparent that whatever talents I might have, they were neither for engineering nor the law. I had not the technical ability for the one, and, in view of what I was to discover for myself in later years, I think I was too honest for the other. But what to do? My academic career, with the crowning disgrace of complicity in the Pine Rock case and temporary expulsion from college, had not been distinguished by any very glittering records in scholarship except that One in Logic. I had failed both my father and the Joyner side of the house in any ambitions they had had for me. My father was dead, and the Joyners were now done with me.",1
5477,"It was a painful situation, and one which is now amusing to look back on. But it was also very human--and very American. Even today I don't think the Joyners have altogether recovered from their own astonishment at the fact that I have actually become ""a writer"". This attitude, which was also my own at the age of twenty, was to shape the course of my life for years.",1
5481,"They were sorry about a great many things and people. The theatre was one of their most passionate concerns, but it seemed that there was hardly a dramatist writing in those days who escaped their censure. Shaw was amusing, but he was not a dramatist--he had never really learned how to write a play. O'Neill's reputation was grossly exaggerated: his dialogue was clumsy, and his characters stock types. Barrie was insufferable on account of his sentimentality. As for Pinero and others of that ilk, their productions were already so dated that they were laughable.",1
5482,"In a way, this super-criticality was a very good thing for me. It taught me to be more questioning about some of the most venerated names and reputations whose authority had been handed down to me by my preceptors and accepted by me with too little thought. But the trouble with it was that I soon became involved, along with the others, in a niggling and over-refined aestheticism which was not only pallid and precious, but too detached from life to provide the substance and the inspiration for high creative work.",1
5483,"It is interesting to look back now and see just what it was we believed fifteen years ago--those of us who were the bright young people of the time and wanted to produce something of value in the arts. We talked a great deal about ""art"" and ""beauty""--a great deal about ""the artist"". A great deal too much, in fact. For the artist as we conceived him was a kind of aesthetic monster. Certainly he was not a living man. And if the artist is not first and foremost a living man--and by this I mean a man of life, a man who belongs to life, who is connected with it so intimately that he draws his strength from it--then what manner of man is he?",1
5484,"The artist we talked about was not such a man at all. Indeed, if he had any existence outside of our imagination he must have been one of the most extraordinary and inhuman freaks that nature ever created. Instead of loving life and believing in life, our ""artist"" hated life and fled from it. That, in fact, was the basic theme of most of the stories, plays, and novels we wrote. We were forever portraying the sensitive man of talent, the young genius, crucified by life, misunderstood and scorned of men, pilloried and driven out by the narrow bigotry and mean provincialism of the town or village, betrayed and humiliated by the cheapness of his wife, and finally crushed, silenced, torn to pieces by the organised power of the mob. So conceived, the artist that we talked about so much, instead of being in union with life, was in perpetual conflict with it. Instead of belonging to the world he lived in, he was constantly in a state of flight from it. The world itself was like a beast of prey, and the artist, like some wounded faun, was for ever trying to escape from it.",1
5492,"Love is enough, though the world be a-waning,"" wrote William Morris. We have his word for it, and can believe it or not as we like. Perhaps it was true for him, yet I doubt it. It may have been true at the moment he wrote it, but not in the end, not when all was said and done.",1
5494,"It did not come like that at all. It came in on me little by little, almost without my knowing it. Up to that time I had been merely the sensitive young fellow in conflict with his town, his family, the life around him--then the sensitive young fellow in love, and so concerned with his little Universe of Love that he thought it the whole universe. But gradually I began to observe things in life which shocked me out of this complete absorption with the independent entities of self. I caught glimpses of the great, the rich, the fortunate ones of all the earth living supinely upon the very best of everything and taking the very best for granted as their right. I saw them enjoying a special privilege which had been theirs so long that it had become a vested interest: they seemed to think it was a law ordained of nature that they should be for ever life's favourite sons. At the same time I began to be conscious of the submerged and forgotten Helots down below, who with their toil and sweat and blood and suffering unutterable supported and nourished the mighty princelings at the top.",1
5497,"For, even at the time when this new vision of the outer world was filtering in and making its strange forms manifest to me, I was also more involved than I had ever been before with my inner struggle. Those were the years of the greatest doubt and desperation I had ever known. I was wrestling with the problems of my second book, and I could take in what my eyes beheld only in brief glimpses, flashes, snatches, fragments. As I was later to discover, the vision etched itself upon some sensitive film within, but it was not until that later time, when the second book was finished and out of the way, that I saw it whole and knew what the total experience had done to me.",1
5506,"The weeks passed so--and then it happened. Little by little the world came in. At first it sifted in almost unnoticed, like dark down dropped in passing from some avenging angel's wing. Sometimes it came to me in the desperate pleading of an eye, the naked terror of a startled look, the swift concealment of a sudden fear. Sometimes it just came and went as light comes, just soaked in, just soaked in--in fleeting words and speech and actions.",1
5514,"I cannot attempt, therefore, to define for you your own ""philosophy""--for to define so is to delimit the ""closed"" and academic man, and you, thank God, are not of that ilk. And to define so would be to call upon me once again your own and curious scorn, your sudden half-amused contemptuousness. For how could anyone pin down neatly the essence of your New Englandness--so sensitively proud, so shy, so shrinking and alone, but at bottom, as I think, so unafraid?",1
5517,"So far as I can see from nine years of observing you, yours is the way of life, the way of thought, of feeling, and of acting, of the Preacher in Ecclesiastes. I know of no better way. For of all that I have ever seen or learned, that book seems to me the noblest, the wisest, and the most powerful expression of man's life upon this earth--and also earth's highest flower of poetry, eloquence, and truth. I am not given to dogmatic judgments in the matter of literary creation, but if I had to make one I could only say that Ecclesiastes is the greatest single piece of writing I have ever known, and the wisdom expressed in it the most lasting and profound.",1
5519,"Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity. You would agree with him in that; but you would also agree with him that the fool foldeth his hands together and eateth his own flesh. You would agree with all your being that ""Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. Is this abridgement and this definition just, dear Fox?",1
5525,"Why, then, the disagreement? Why, then, the struggle that ensued, the severance that has now occurred? We saw the same things, and we called them by the same names. We abhorred them with the same indignation and disgust--and yet, we disagreed, and I am making my farewell to you. Dear friend, the parent and the guardian of my spirit in its youth, the thing has happened and we know it. Why?  I know the answer, and the thing I have to tell you now is this:  Beyond the limits of my own mortality, the stern acknowledgment that man was born to live, to suffer, and to die--your own and the great Preacher's creed--I am not, cannot be, confirmed to more fatality.",1
5529,"All of this makes the paradox of our great difference as bard and strange as the paradox of our polarity. And in this lies the root of trouble and the seed of severance. Your own philosophy has led you to accept the order of things as they are because you have no hope of changing them; and if you could change them, you feel that any other order would be just as bad. In everlasting terms--those of eternity--you and the Preacher may be right: for there is no greater wisdom than the wisdom of Ecclesiastes, no acceptance finally so true as the stern fatalism of the rock. Man was born to live, to suffer, and to die, and what befalls him is a tragic lot. There is no denying this in the final end. But we must, dear Fox, deny it all along the way.",1
5530,"Mankind was fashioned for eternity, but Man-Alive was fashioned for a day. New evils will come after him, but it is with the present evils that he is now concerned. And the essence of all faith, it seems to me, for such a man as I, the essence of religion for people of my belief, is that man's life can be, and will be, better; that man's greatest enemies, in the forms in which they now exist--the forms we see on every hand of fear, hatred, slavery, cruelty, poverty, and need--can be conquered and destroyed. But to conquer and destroy them will mean nothing less than the complete revision of the structure of society as we know it. They cannot be conquered by the sorrowful acquiescence of resigned fatality. They cannot be destroyed by the philosophy of acceptance--by the tragic hypothesis that things as they are, evil as they are, are as good and as bad as, under any form-they will ever be. The evils that we hate, you no less than I, cannot be overthrown with shrugs and sighs and shakings of the head how, ever wise. It seems to me that they but mock at us and only become more bold when we retreat before them and take refuge in the affirmation of man's tragic average. To believe that new monsters will arise as vicious as the old, to believe that the great Pandora's box of human frailty, once opened, will never show a diminution of its ugly swarm, is to help, by just that much, to make it so for ever.",1
5533,"You never had a doubt that I would finish--make an end--round out the cycle--come to the whole of it. The only doubt was mine, enhanced, tormented by my own fatigue and desperation, and by the clacking of the feeble and malicious little tongues which, knowing nothing, whispered that I would never make an end again because I could not begin. We both knew how grotesquely false this was--so false and so grotesque that it was sometimes the subject of an anguished and exasperated laugh. The truth was so far different that my own fears were just the opposite: that I might never make an end to anything again because I could never get through telling what I knew, what I felt and thought and had to say about it.",1
5543,"Every morning the two friends walked silently together until they reached the main street of the town. Then when they came to a certain fruit and candy store they paused for a moment on the sidewalk outside. The Greek, Spiros Antonapoulos, worked for his cousin, who owned this fruit store. His job was to make candies and sweets, uncrate the fruits, and to keep the place clean. The thin mute, John Singer, nearly always put his hand on his friend's arm and looked for a second into his face before leaving him. Then after this good-bye Singer crossed the street and walked on alone to the jewelry store where he worked as a silverware engraver.",0
5550,"The town was in the middle of the deep South. The summers were long and the months of winter cold were very few. Nearly always the sky was a glassy, brilliant azure and the sun burned down riotously bright. Then the light, chill rains of November would come, and perhaps later there would be frost and some short months of cold. The winters were changeable, but the summers always were burning hot. The town was a fairly large one. On the main street there were several blocks of two- and three-story shops and business offices. But the largest buildings in the town were the factories, which employed a large percentage of the population. These cotton mills were big and flourishing and most of the workers in the town were very poor. Often in the faces along the streets there was the desperate look of hunger and of loneliness.",0
5553,"The Greek was very fretful, and kept finding fault with the fruit drinks and food that Singer prepared for him. Constantly he made his friend help him out of bed so that he could pray. His huge buttocks would sag down over his plump little feet when he kneeled. He fumbled with his hands to say 'Darling Mary' and then held to the small brass cross tied to his neck with a dirty string. His big eyes would wall up to the ceiling with a look of fear in them, and afterward he was very sulky and would not let his friend speak to him.",0
5557,"The months went on and these habits of Antonapoulos grew worse. One day at noon he walked calmly out of the fruit store of his cousin and urinated in public against the wall of the First National Bank Building across the street. At times he would meet people on the sidewalk whose faces did not please him, and he would bump into these persons and push at them with his elbows and stomach. He walked into a store one day and hauled out a floor lamp without paying for it, and another time he tried to take an electric train he had seen in a showcase.",0
5561,All of Singer's money was gone and he had to borrow from the jeweler for whom he worked. On one occasion he was unable to pay bail for his friend and Antonapoulos spent the night in jail. When Singer came to get him out the next day he was very sulky. He did not want to leave. He had enjoyed his dinner of sowbelly and cornbread with syrup poured over it. And the new sleeping arrangements and his cellmates pleased him.,0
5563,And then the final trouble came to Singer. One afternoon he had come to meet Antonapoulos at the fruit store when Charles Parker handed him a letter. The letter explained that Charles Parker had made arrangements for his cousin to be taken to the state insane asylum two hundred miles away. Charles Parker had used his influence in the town and the details were already settled. Antonapoulos was to leave and to be admitted into the asylum the next week.,0
5566,"Singer knew that everything was finished. The Greek was afraid that some day he might be responsible for his cousin. Charles Parker did not know much about the American language--but he understood the American dollar very well, and he had used his money and influence to admit his cousin to the asylum without delay.",0
5568,"Then came the day when Antonapoulos must leave. Singer brought out his own suitcase and very carefully packed the best of their joint possessions. Antonapoulos made himself a lunch to eat during the journey. In the late afternoon they walked arm in arm down the street for the last time together. It was a chilly afternoon in late November, and little huffs of breath showed in the air before them.",0
5571,Singer tried to think of the time before he had ever known his friend. He tried to recount to himself certain things that had happened when he was young. But none of these things he tried to remember seemed real.,0
5576,"He began spending his evenings walking around the town. He could no longer stand the rooms where Antonapoulos had lived, and he rented a place in a shambling boarding-house not far from the center of the town. He ate his meals at a restaurant only two blocks away. This restaurant was at the very end of the long main street, and the name of the place was the New York Café. The first day he glanced over the menu quickly and wrote a short note and handed it to the proprietor.",0
5584,Calmly Biff put down the suitcase on the steps outside. The air was not so stale and sultry in the room as it was downstairs. He decided to stay for a short while and douse his face with cold water before going back.,0
5585,"'I told you already what I'll do if you don't get rid of that fellow for good tonight. In the daytime he takes them naps at the back, and then at night you feed him dinners and beer. For a week now he hasn't paid one cent. And all his wild talking and carrying-on will ruin any decent trade. '",0
5594,"'The enjoyment of a spectacle is something you have never known,' he said. Her voice was tired. 'That fellow downstairs is a spectacle, all right, and a circus too. But I'm through putting up with him.'",0
5596,"It was the morning of May 15, yes, that Jake Blount had come in. He had noticed him immediately and watched. The man was short, with heavy shoulders like beams. He had a small, ragged mustache, and beneath this his lower lip looked as though it had been stung by a wasp. There were many things about the fellow that seemed contrary. His head was very large and well-shaped, but his neck was soft and slender as a boy's. The mustache looked false, as if it had been stuck on for a costume party and would fall off if he talked too fast. It made him seem almost middle-aged, although his face with its high, smooth forehead and wide-open eyes was young. His hands were huge, stained, and calloused, and he was dressed in a cheap white-linen suit. There was something very funny about the man, yet at the same time another feeling would not let you laugh.",0
5597,"He ordered a pint of liquor and drank it straight in half an hour. Then he sat at one of the booths and ate a big chicken dinner. Later he read a book and drank beer. That was the beginning. And although Biff had noticed Blount very carefully he would never have guessed about the crazy things that happened later. Never had he seen a man change so many times in twelve days. Never had he seen a fellow drink so much, stay drunk so long.",0
5602,"Biff sensed that someone was standing in the entrance and he raised his eyes quickly. A gangling, towheaded youngster, a girl of about twelve, stood looking in the doorway. She was dressed in khaki shorts, a blue shirt, and tennis shoes--so that at first glance she was like a very young boy. Biff pushed aside the paper when he saw her, and smiled when she came up to him.",0
5616,Blount leaned heavily on the counter. His brown eyes were wet-looking and wide open with a dazed expression. He needed a bath so badly that he stank like a goat. There were dirt beads on his sweaty neck and an oil stain on his face. His lips were thick and red and his brown hair was matted on his forehead. His overalls were too short in the body and he kept pulling at the crotch of them.,0
5622,"Blount's eyes were dreamy and unfocused. 'Carolina,' he said. 'I can tell you've been around,' Biff hinted delicately.",0
5632,Blount paid no attention to anyone in the place except the mute. They were both looking at each other. The mute's eyes were cold and gentle as a cat's and all his body seemed to listen. The drunk man was in a frenzy.,0
5635,Biff rested his elbows on the counter and looked at Blount with curiosity. 'Know what?' he asked.,0
5637,"'Masons?' Biff asked. 'Shut up, you! Else I'll snatch your arm off and beat you black with it,' Blount bawled. He hunched over close to the mute and his voice dropped to a drunken whisper. ' And how come? Why has this miracle of ignorance endured? Because of one thing. A conspiracy. A vast and insidious conspiracy. Obscurantism. '",0
5641,Blount was so drunk that he did not know what had happened. He had never even caught on to the fact that the mute made no answers. He began to look around the place with his mouth open and his eyes rolling and fuddled. A red vein stood out on his forehead and he began to hit the table angrily with his fists. His bout could not last much longer now.,0
5648,'It this here short white man with the m-m-mustache.'  'Mr. Blount. Yes.' 'Well--I didn't see how it commenced. I were standing in the back door when I heard this here commotion. Sound like a big fight in the alley. So I r-r-run to see. And this here white man had just gone hog wild. He were butting his head against the side of this brick wall and hitting with his fists. He were cussing and fighting like I never seen a white man fight before. With just this here wall. He liable to broken his own head the way he were carrying-on. Then two white mens who had heard the commotion come up and stand around and look----'  ',0
5650,Biff bowed his head and organized the story he had just heard into a neat pattern. He rubbed his nose and thought for a minute. 'They liable to pile in here any minute.' Willie went to the door and looked down the street. 'Here they all come now. They having to drag him. ',0
5651,A dozen onlookers and a policeman all tried to crowd into the restaurant. Outside a couple of whores stood looking in through the front window. It was always funny how many people could crowd in from nowhere when anything out of the ordinary happened.,0
5653,"The policeman put the drunk in a chair and hustled the little crowd into the street again. Then he turned to Biff: 'Somebody said he was staying here with you.' 'No. But he might as well be,' Biff said.",0
5654,'Want me to take him with me?' Biff considered. 'He won't get into any more trouble tonight. Of course I can't be responsible--but I think this will calm him down. ',0
5655,"'O.K. I'll drop back in again before I knock off.'  Biff, Singer, and Jake Blount were left alone. For the first time since he had been brought in, Biff turned his attention to the drunk man. It seemed that Blount had hurt his jaw very badly. He was slumped down on the table with his big hand over his mouth, swaying backward and forward. There was a gash in his head and the blood ran from his temple. His knuckles were skinned raw, and he was so filthy that he looked as if he had been pulled by the scruff of the neck from a sewer. All the juice had spurted out of him and he was completely collapsed. The mute sat at the table across from him, taking it all in with his gray eyes.",0
5660,"Biff enunciated slowly so that the mute could see. 'The jitters----' he said conversationally. The steam from the soup kept floating up into Blount's face, and after a little while he reached shakily for his spoon. He drank the soup and ate part of his dessert. His thick, heavy lips still trembled and he bowed his head far down over his plate.",0
5664,"Biff went with them to the entrance. 'Buck up and keep your nose clean,' he said to Blount. The black night sky was beginning to lighten and turn a deep blue with the new morning. There were but a few weak, silvery stars. The street was empty, silent, almost cool. Singer carried the suitcase with his left hand, and with his free hand he supported Blount. He nodded good-bye to Biff and they started off together down the sidewalk. Biff stood watching them. After they had gone half a block away only their black forms showed in the blue darkness--the mute straight and firm and the broad-shouldered, stumbling Blount holding on to him. When he could see them no longer, Biff waited for a moment and examined the sky. The vast depth of it fascinated and oppressed him. He rubbed his forehead and went back into the sharply lighted restaurant.",0
5671,Biff took off his shirt and examined the collar to see if it were clean enough to be worn again. 'Go down and see for yourself. I told you nobody will hinder you from kicking him out. ',0
5672,"Sleepily Alice reached down and picked up a Bible, the blank side of a menu, and a Sunday School book from the floor beside the bed. She rustled through the tissue pages of the Bible until she reached a certain passage and began reading, pronouncing the words aloud with painful concentration. It was Sunday, and she was preparing the weekly lesson for her class of boys in the Junior Department of her church. ' Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. And Jesus said unto them, ""Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. '",0
5687,"When Mick had finished half of the cigarette she smashed it dead and flipped the butt down the slant of the roof. Then she leaned forward so that her head rested on her arms and began to hum to herself. It was a funny thing--but nearly all the time there was some kind of piano piece or other music going on in the back of her mind. No matter what she was doing or thinking it was nearly always there. Miss Brown, who boarded with them, had a radio in her room, and all last winter she would sit on the steps every Sunday afternoon and listen in on the programs. Those were probably classical pieces, but they were the ones she remembered best. There was one special fellow's music that made her heart shrink up every time she heard it. Sometimes this fellow's music was like little colored pieces of crystal candy, and other times it was the softest, saddest thing she had ever imagined about.",0
5688,"There was the sudden sound of crying. Mick sat up straight and listened. The wind ruffled the fringe of hair on her forehead and the bright sun made her face white and damp. The whimpering continued, and Mick moved slowly along the sharp-pointed roof on her hands and knees. When she reached the end she leaned forward and lay on her stomach so that her head jutted over the edge and she could see the ground below.",0
5697,"Mick drew the big block letters very slowly. At the top she wrote EDISON, and under that she drew the names of DICK TRACY and MUSSOLINI. Then in each corner with the largest letters of all, made with green and outlined in red, she wrote her initials--M.K. When that was done she crossed over to the opposite wall and wrote a very bad word--PUSSY, and beneath that she put her initials, too.",0
5700,"Ralph was tied in the wagon just as she had left him. He sat up quiet and still and his fat little hands held on to the sides. Ralph looked like a little Chinese baby with his square black bangs and his black eyes. The sun was in his face, and that was why he had been hollering. Bubber was nowhere around. When Ralph saw her coming he began tuning up to cry again. She pulled the wagon into the shade by the side of the new house and took from her shirt pocket a blue-colored jelly bean. She stuck the candy in the baby's warm, soft mouth.",0
5705,"'Get up in the wagon,' she told Bubber. ' And let Ralph sit in your lap.'",0

5718,Mick brushed back her shaggy bangs with the palm of her hand. She had done this so often that there was a little row of cowlicks above her forehead. She quivered her nose and made faces at herself in the mirror. Then she began walking around the room again.,0
5719,Hazel and Etta were O.K. as far as sisters went. But Etta was like she was full of worms. All she thought about was movie stars and getting in the movies. Once she had written to Jeanette MacDonald and had got a typewritten letter back saying that if ever she came out to Hollywood she could come by and swim in her swimming pool. And ever since that swimming pool had been preying on Etta's mind. All she thought about was going to Hollywood when she could scrape up the bus fare and getting a job as a secretary and being buddies with Jeanette MacDonald and getting in the movies herself.,0
5722,"'Are you just going to tramp around the room all day? It makes me sick to see you in those silly boy's clothes. Somebody ought to clamp down on you, Mick Kelly, and make you behave,' Etta said.",0
5728,"Bill went on reading. She still knelt over the box, but did not open it. Her eyes wandered over to Bill as he sat with his back to her. One of his big feet kept stepping on the other as he read. His shoes were scuffed. Once their Dad had said that all Bill's dinners went to his feet and his breakfast to one ear and his supper to the other ear. That was a sort of mean thing to say and Bill had been sour over it for a month, but it was funny. His ears flared out and were very red, and though he was just out of high school he wore a size thirteen shoe. He tried to hide his feet by scraping one foot behind the other when he stood up, but that only made it worse.",0
5731,"Mick went into the closet of Bill's room and brought out some other pictures she had done in the class--some pencil drawings, some water-colors, and one canvas with oils. They were all full of people. She had imagined a big fire on Broad Street and painted how she thought it would be. The flames were bright green and orange and Mr. Brannon's restaurant and the First National Bank were about the only buildings left. People were lying dead in the streets and others were running for their lives. One man was in his nightshirt and a lady was trying to carry a bunch of bananas with her. Another picture was called 'Boiler Busts in Factory,' and men were jumping out of windows and running while a knot of kids in overalls stood scrouged together, holding the buckets of dinner they had brought to their Daddies. The oil painting was a picture of the whole town fighting on Broad Street. She never knew why she had painted this one and she couldn't think of the right name for it. There wasn't any fire or storm or reason you could see in the picture why all this battle was happening. But there were more people and more moving around than in any other picture. This was the best one, and it was too bad that she couldn't think up the real name. In the back of her mind somewhere she knew what it was.",0
5742,"Mick tried to jerk loose, but her Mama held on to her arm. Sullenly she wiped the tears from her face with the back of her hand. Her Mama had been in the kitchen and she wore her apron and house-shoes. As usual she looked as though she had a lot on her mind and didn't have time to ask her any more questions.",0
5745,"In the hall there was the smell of cigarettes and Sunday dinner. Mick took a deep breath and walked back toward the kitchen. The dinner began to smell good and she was hungry. She could hear Portia's voice as she talked to Bubber, and it was like she was half-singing something or telling him a story.",0
5746,"'And that is the various reason why I'm a whole lot more fortunate than most colored girls,' Portia said as she opened the door. 'Why?' asked Mick. Portia and Bubber were sitting at the kitchen table eating their dinner. Portia's green print dress was cool-looking against her dark brown skin. She had on green earrings and her hair was combed very tight and neat.",0
5747,"'You all time pounce in on the very tail of what somebody say and then want to know all about it,' Portia said. She got up and stood over the hot stove, putting dinner on Mick's plate. 'Bubber and me was just talking about my Grandpapa's home out on the Old Sardis Road. I was telling Bubber how he and my uncles owns the whole place themself. Fifteen and a half acre. They always plants four of them in cotton, some years swapping back to peas to keep the dirt rich, and one acre on a hill is just for peaches. They haves a mule and a breed sow and all the time from twenty to twenty-five laying hens and fryers. They haves a vegetable patch and two pecan trees and plenty figs and plums and berries. This here is the truth. Not many white farms has done with their land good as my Grandpapa.'",0
5751,"Portia stopped chewing. 'Whose Father? You mean my Father?'  'Sure,' said Mick.",0
5759,"'I don't believe in God any more than I do Santa Claus,' Mick said. 'You wait a minute! That's why it sometime seem to me you favor my Father more than any person I ever knowed. '",0
5762,"Mick got up from the table and stood in the doorway, ready to leave. Sometimes it was fun to devil Portia. She started on the same tune and said the same thing over and over--like that was all she knew.",0
5766,"'What, Portia?' Bubber asked. 'What kind of things does He eat?' Mick laughed and stamped out of the room.",0
5770,She had always kept things to herself. That was one sure truth. Mick went slowly up the stairs. She passed the first landing and went on to the second. Some of the doors were open to make a draught and there were many sounds in the house. Mick stopped on the last flight of stairs and sat down. If Miss Brown turned on her radio she could hear the music. Maybe some good program would come on.,0
5773,"After about an hour there was the sound of a doorknob being turned on the landing above. Mick looked up quickly and it was Mister Singer. He stood in the hall for a few minutes and his face was sad and calm. Then he went across to the bathroom. His company did not come out with him. From where she was sitting she could see part of the room, and the company was asleep on the bed with a sheet pulled over him. She waited for Mister Singer to come out of the bathroom. Her cheeks were very hot and she felt them with her hands. Maybe it was true that she came up on these top steps sometimes so she could see Mister Singer while she was listening to Miss Brown's radio on the floor below. She wondered what kind of music he heard in his mind that his ears couldn't hear. Nobody knew. And what kind of things he would say if he could talk. Nobody knew that either.",0
5776,"[4] Late in the afternoon Jake Blount awoke with the feeling that he had slept enough. The room in which he lay was small and neat, furnished with a bureau, a table, a bed, and a few chairs. On the bureau an electric fan turned its face slowly from one wall to another, and as the breeze from it passed Jake's face he thought of cool water. By the window a man sat before the table and stared down at a chess game laid out before him. In the daylight the room was not familiar to Jake, but he recognized the man's face instantly and it was as though he had known him a very long time.",0
5785,"They sat at the table and drank hot coffee out of blue cups. The room was cool and the half-drawn shades softened the hard glare from the windows. Singer brought from his closet a tin box that contained a loaf of bread, some oranges, and cheese. He did not eat much, but sat leaning back in his chair with one hand in his pocket. Jake ate hungrily. He would have to leave the place immediately and think things over. As long as he was stranded he ought to scout around for some sort of job in a hurry. The quiet room was too peaceful and comfortable to worry in--he would get out and walk by himself for a while.",0
5805,She looked from one to the other. 'You all got to decide.' 'Well----' said the shorter boy in the red socks. 'Highboy and me thought m-maybe us three go to church. ',0
5806,"The girl sang her answer in three different tones. ' O--K-- And after church I got a notion I ought to go and set with Father for a while--just a short while.' They turned at the first corner, and Jake stood watching them a moment before walking on.",0
5810,"The café was very dark after the brightness outside. Everything looked dingier and quieter than he had remembered it. Brannon stood behind the cash register as usual, his arms folded over his chest. His good-looking plump wife sat filing her fingernails at the other end of the counter. Jake noticed that they glanced at each other as he came in.",0
5818,What makes you ask all this? You mean to try to get a job in a mill?' Jake dug his fist into his eye and rubbed it sleepily. 'Don't know. I might and I might not.' He laid the newspaper on the counter and pointed out the advertisement he had just read. 'I think I'll go around and look into this. ',0
5821,"Jake nodded. 'What do you think of him?' Jake bit his lips. The mute's face was in his mind very clearly. It was like the face of a friend he had known for a long time. He had been thinking of the man ever since he had left his room. 'I didn't even know he was a dummy,' he said finally.",0
5840,"'Hey,' Jake said. The three men stared at him with mill-sallow, dead-pan faces. They murmured but did not change their positions. Jake pulled the package of Target from his pocket and passed it around. He sat down on the bottom step and took off his shoes. The cool, damp ground felt good to his feet.",0
5841,"'Working now?' 'Yeah,' said the man with the straw hat. ' Most of the time. '",0
5845,'It's not that kind. It's better. It's the truth. ',0
5849,"'How you mean--mad?' The vein in Jake's forehead was swollen and scarlet. 'Christamighty, man! I mean mad--m-a-d--mad.' He scowled up into their puzzled, sallow faces. Behind them, through the open front door he could see the inside of the house. In the front room there was three beds and a washstand. In the back room a barefooted woman sat sleeping in a chair. From one of the dark porches near-by there was the sound of a guitar.",0
5853,The men laughed in the slow and easy way that three men laugh at one. Jake brushed the dirt from the soles of his feet and put on his shoes. His fists were closed tight and his mouth was contorted with an angry sneer. 'Laugh--that's all you're good for. I hope you sit there and snicker 'til you rot!' As he walked stiffly down the street the sound of their laughter and catcalls still followed him.,0
5857,"The mute smiled, but Jake could not tell if he had caught what he had said. The mute looked at the fruit with surprise and then undid the cellophane wrappings. As he handled the fruits there was something very peculiar in the fellow's face. Jake tried to understand this look and was stumped. Then Singer smiled brightly.",0
5859,'I bet I'm the only man in this town that's been mad--I'm talking about really mean mad--for ten solid long years. I damn near got in a fight just a little while ago. Sometimes it seems to me like I might even be crazy. I just don't know. ',0
5863,Jake pressed his fists to his temples. His thoughts had careened in several directions and he could not get control of them. He wanted to go berserk. He wanted to get out and fight violently with someone in a crowded street.,0
5868,"[5] Far from the main street, in one of the Negro sections of the town, Doctor Benedict Mady Copeland sat in his dark kitchen alone. It was past nine o'clock and the Sunday bells were silent now. Although the night was very hot, there was a small fire in the round-bellied wood stove. Doctor Copeland sat close to it, leaning forward in a straight-backed kitchen chair with his head cupped in his long, slender hands. The red glow from the chinks of the stove shone on his face--in this light his heavy lips looked almost purple against his black skin, and his gray hair, tight against his skull like a cap of lamb's wool, took on a bluish color also. He sat motionless in this position for a long time. Even his eyes, which stared from behind the silver rims of his spectacles, did not change their fixed, somber gaze. Then he cleared his throat harshly and picked up a book from the floor beside his chair. All around him the room was very dark, and he had to hold the book close to the stove to make out the print. Tonight he read Spinoza. He did not wholly understand the intricate play of ideas and the complex phrases, but as he read he sensed a strong, true purpose behind the words and he felt that he almost understood.",0
5873,"'It sure is roasting in here,' she said. 'Seem to me you would let this here fire die down except when you cooking.'  'If you prefer we can go up to my office,' Doctor Copeland said. 'I be all right, I guess. I don't prefer. '  Doctor Copeland adjusted his silver-rimmed glasses and then folded his hands in his lap.",0
5875,"'William still boards with you?' 'Sure he do,' Portia said. 'You see--us haves our own way of living and our own plan. Highboy--he pay the rent. I buys all the food out of my money. And Willie--he tends to all of our church dues, insurance, lodge dues, and Saturday Night. Us three haves our own plan and each one of us does our parts.'",0
5879,"'It does not matter.' 'You still don't eat nair meat?'  'No. For purely private reasons I am a vegetarian, but it does not matter if you wish to cook the collards with a piece of meat.'",0
5880,"Without putting on her shoes Portia stood at the table and carefully began to pick over the greens. 'This here floor sure do feel good to my feets. You mind if I just walk around like this without putting back on them tight, hurting pumps?'  'No,' said Doctor Copeland.",0
5882,"Doctor Copeland followed Portia with his eyes. She moved slowly around the room in her stockinged feet, taking down the scrubbed pans from the wall, building up the fire, washing the grit from the collards. He opened his mouth to speak once and then composed his lips again.",0
5895,"Portia spread out her lips and blew into her saucer of coffee. 'I suppose you done read in the paper about this Goverment Pincher business for old folks?'  Doctor Copeland nodded. 'Pension,' he said.",0
5905,"'Well, this here is a truth. Everbody is scared of you. It sure would take a whole lot of gin to get Hamilton or Buddy or Willie or my Highboy to come in this house and sit with you like I does. Willie say he remember you when he were only a little boy and he were afraid of his own father then. '",0
5907,"'No,' said Doctor Copeland. 'You have not seen my feelings injured. '",0
5908,'Course I realize that Willie or my Highboy or me--that none of us is scholars. But Highboy and Willie is both good as gold. There just is a difference between them and you.',0
5912,"Portia saw and went up to him quickly. She put her arms around his head and pressed her cheek to his forehead. 'I done hurt my Father's feelings,' she said softly.",0
5915,'Less us not ever quarrel no more. I can't stand this here fighting between us. It seem to me that something real bad come up in us ever time we be together. Less us never quarrel like this no more.',0
5919,He would exhort her and he would tell her all that was in his heart and still she was gentle. And still she would not listen to him but would go on her own way. Then later there were Hamilton and Karl Marx and William and Portia. And this feeling of real true purpose for them was so strong that he knew exactly how each thing should be with them. Hamilton would be a great scientist and Karl Marx a teacher of the Negro race and William a lawyer to fight against injustice and Portia a doctor for women and children.,0
5921,"Because of the true purpose for Hamilton, Karl Marx, William, and Portia, he knew how every detail should be. In the autumn of each year he took them all into town and bought for them good black shoes and black stockings. For Portia he bought black woolen material for dresses and white linen for collars and cuffs. For the boys there was black wool for trousers and fine white linen for shirts. He did not want them to wear bright-colored, flimsy clothes. But when they went to school those were the ones they wished to wear, and Daisy said that they were embarrassed and that he was a hard father. He knew how the house should be. There could be no fanciness--no gaudy calendars or lace pillows or knickknacks--but everything in the house must be plain and dark and indicative of work and the real true purpose.",0
5924,"He would start all over with them, but in a different way. He would bring out their lessons and talk with them. They would sit close together and look at their mother. He would talk and talk, but none of them wanted to understand.",0
5930,Doctor Copeland did not know how to begin. Sometimes he thought that he had talked so much in the years before to his children and they had understood so little that now there was nothing at all to say. After a while he wiped his mouth with his handkerchief and spoke in an uncertain voice.,0
5932,"'That is not right,' said Doctor Copeland. 'Why do you stand for it?' 'It ain't her fault. She can't help it,' said Portia. ' Half the folks in that house don't pay the rent, and it a big expense to keep everthing up. I tell you the truth--the Kellys is just barely keeping one jump ahead of the sheriff. They having a mighty hard time. '",0
5940,A few nights ago a drunken white man had come up to him and begun pulling him along the street. He had his bag with him and he was sure someone was hurt. But the drunkard had pulled him into a white man's restaurant and the white men at the counter had begun hollering out with their insolence. He knew that the drunkard was making fun of him. Even then he had kept the dignity in him.,0
5945,'Mr. Singer would tell you. He a truly kind white man and he not a bit biggity. ',0
5947,"'Sure I would if I was you. You a grand letter-writer and I would give it to Mr. Singer for you,' said Portia. ' He come down in the kitchen two-three weeks ago with a few shirts he wanted me to rinch out for him. Them shirts were no more dirty than if Saint John the Baptist hisself had been wearing them. All I had to do were dip them in warm water and give the collars a small rub and press them. But that night when I taken them five clean shirts up to his room you know how much he give me?'  'No.'",0
5953,"He could not straighten his glasses to just the right position and his fingers kept trembling. From the front yard there was the sound of low voices. Then heavy footsteps were in the hall and Portia, William, and Highboy entered the kitchen.",0
5957,"'Willie, you were going pretty good with your harp,' said Portia finally. 'Look to me like you and Highboy must of got into somebody's gin bottle.'  'No, ma'am,' said Highboy very politely. 'Us haven't had anything since Saturday. Us have just been enjoying our horseshoe game. '",0
5958,"Doctor Copeland still did not speak, and they all kept glancing at him and waiting. The room was close and the quietness made everyone nervous. 'I do haves the hardest time with them boys' clothes,' Portia said. 'I washes both of them white suits ever Saturday and I presses them twice a week. And look at them now. Course they don't wear them except when they gets home from work. But after two days they seems to be potty black. I ironed them pants just last night and now there not a crease left.'",0
5960,"His voice was high and it did not sound as though it came from himself. 'William, I wonder how much of all the things I have said to you when you were a child have stayed in your mind. '",0
5965,With one arm Portia held to her husband and brother and with the other she reached out to Doctor Copeland. 'Less us all make up now before us goes. I can't stand this here fighting between us. Less us not ever quarrel no more.',0
5966,"In silence Doctor Copeland shook hands again with each of them. 'I am sorry,' he said. 'It quite all right with me,' said Highboy politely.",0
5971,[6] By midsummer Singer had visitors more often than any other person in the house. From his room in the evening there was nearly always the sound of a voice. After dinner at the New York Café he bathed and dressed himself in one of his cool wash suits and as a rule did not go out again. The room was cool and pleasant. He had an ice box in the closet where he kept bottles of cold beer and fruit drinks. He was never busy or in a hurry. And always he met his guests at the door with a welcome smile.,0
5980,"The room was large and sunny. Several beds were spaced in a row together. Three old men played a game of slapjack in a corner. They did not notice Singer or Antonapoulos, and the two friends sat alone on the other side of the room.",0
5982,"Antonapoulos kept his dark, oily eyes on his friend and did not move. His hands fumbled languidly with the crotch of his trousers. Singer told him, among other things, about the visitors who had been coming to see him. He told his friend that they helped take his mind away from his lonesomeness. He told Antonapoulos that they were strange people and always talking--but that he liked to have them come. He drew quick sketches of Jake Blount and Mick and Doctor Copeland. Then as soon as he saw that Antonapoulos was not interested Singer crumpled the sketches and forgot about them. When the attendant came in to say that their time was up, Singer had not finished half of the things he wanted to say. But he left the room very tired and happy.",0
5985,"His next visit was the last one, for his two weeks' vacation was almost over. Antonapoulos had forgotten what had happened before. They sat in their same corner of the room. The minutes slipped by quickly. Singer's hands talked desperately and his narrow face was very pale. At last it was time for him to go. He held his friend by the arm and looked into his face in the way that he used to do when they parted each day before work. Antonapoulos stared at him drowsily and did not move. Singer left the room with his hands stuffed hard into his pockets.",0
5986,"Soon after Singer returned to his room at the boarding-house, Mick and Jake Blount and Doctor Copeland began to come again. Each one of them wanted to know where he had been and why he had not let them know about his plans. But Singer pretended that he did not understand their questions, and his smile was inscrutable.",0
5987,One by one they would come to Singer's room to spend the evening with him. The mute was always thoughtful and composed. His many-tinted gentle eyes were grave as a sorcerer's. Mick Kelly and Jake Blount and Doctor Copeland would come and talk in the silent room--for they felt that the mute would always understand whatever they wanted to say to him. And maybe even more than that.,0
5996,"Her Dad just stared at her. She could tell he didn't have any reason for calling. He only wanted real bad to talk to her. He tried to think of some way to begin. His brown eyes were too big for his long, thin face, and since he had lost every single hair the pale, bald top of his head gave him a naked look. He still looked at her without speaking and she was in a hurry. She had to be at that house by nine sharp and there was no time to waste. Her Dad saw she was in a hurry and he cleared his throat.",0
5999,"'I been thinking a lot tonight,' her Dad said. He poured out his beer and sprinkled a few grains of salt on the back of his hand. Then he licked up the salt and took a swallow out of the glass.",0
6002,She understood this while they were looking at each other. It gave her a queer feeling. Her Dad picked up a watch spring and cleaned it with a brush dipped in gasoline.,0
6013,"This would be the first party she had ever given. She had never even been to more than four or five. Last summer she had gone to a prom party. But none of the boys asked her to prom or dance, so she just stood by the punch bowl until all the refreshments were gone and then went home. This party was not going to be a bit like that one. In a few hours now the people she had invited would start coming and the to-do would begin.",0
6014,"It was hard to remember just how she got the idea of this party. The notion came to her soon after she started at Vocational. High School was swell. Everything about it was different from Grammar School. She wouldn't have liked it so much if she had had to take a stenographic course like Hazel and Etta had done--but she got special permission and took mechanical shop like a boy. Shop and Algebra and Spanish were grand. English was mighty hard. Her English teacher was Miss Minner. Everybody said Miss Minner had sold her brains to a famous doctor for ten thousand dollars, so that after she was dead he could cut them up and see why she was so smart. On written lessons she cracked such questions as 'Name eight famous contemporaries of Doctor Johnson,' and 'Quote ten lines from ""The Vicar of Wakefield.""' She called on people by the alphabet and kept her grade book open during the lessons. And even if she was brainy she was an old sourpuss. The Spanish teacher had traveled once in Europe. She said that in France the people carried home loaves of bread without having them wrapped up. They would stand talking on the streets and hit the bread on a lamp post. And there wasn't any water in France--only wine.",0
6015,"In nearly all ways Vocational was wonderful. They walked back and forth in the hall between classes, and at lunch period students hung around the gym. Here was the thing that soon began to bother her. In the halls the people would walk up and down together and everybody seemed to belong to some special bunch. Within a week or two she knew people in the halls and in classes to speak to them--but that was all. She wasn't a member of any bunch. In Grammar School she would have just gone up to any crowd she wanted to belong with and that would have been the end of the matter. Here it was different.",0
6016,During the first week she walked up and down the halls by herself and thought about this. She planned about being with some bunch almost as much as she thought of music. Those two things were in her head all the time. And finally she got the idea of the party.,0
6017,"She was strict with the invitations. No Grammar School kids and nobody under twelve years old. She just asked people between thirteen and fifteen. She knew everybody she invited good enough to speak to them in the halls--and when she didn't know their names she asked to find out. She called up those who had a telephone, and the rest she invited at school.",0
6026,She gave in and took one of the sandwiches. Then she made Bubber stay with Portia and went into the middle room. The dress she would wear was laying out on the bed. Hazel and Etta had both been good about lending her their best clothes--considering that they weren't supposed to come to the party. There was Etta's long blue crêpe de chine evening dress and some white pumps and a rhinestone tiara for her hair. These clothes were really gorgeous. It was hard to imagine how she would look in them.,0
6027,"The late afternoon had come and the sun made long, yellow slants through the window. If she took two hours over dressing for the party it was time to begin now. When she thought about putting on the fine clothes she couldn't just sit around and wait. Very slowly she went into the bathroom and shucked off her old shorts and shirt and turned on the water. She scrubbed the rough parts of her heels and her knees and especially her elbows. She made the bath take a long time.",0
6031,* * * * *  'Yippee! The punch!'  'The cutest dress----'  'Say!,0
6033,"'Everybody get a prom card and start signing up.' At first the room was too loud for anyone to hear and pay attention. The boys were so thick around the punch bowl that the table and the vines didn't show at all. Only her Dad's face rose up above the boys' heads as he smiled and dished up the punch into the little paper cups. On the seat of the hatrack beside her were a jar of candy and two handkerchiefs. A couple of girls thought it was her birthday, and she had thanked them and unwrapped the presents without telling them she wouldn't be fourteen for eight more months. Every person was as clean and fresh and dressed up as she was. They smelled good. The boys had their hair plastered down wet and slick. The girls with their different-colored long dresses stood together, and they were like a bright hunk of flowers. The start was marvelous. The beginning of this party was O.K.  'I'm part Scotch-Irish and French and----'  'I got German blood----'",0
6034,She hollered about the prom cards one more time before she went into the dining-room. Soon they began to pile in from the hall. Every person took a prom card and they lined up in bunches against the walls of the room. This was the real start now.,0
6038,"It was then she began to notice Harry Minowitz. He lived in the house next door and she had known him all her life. Although he was two years older she had grown faster than him, and in the summer-time they used to wrestle and fight out on the plot of grass by the street. Harry was a Jew boy, but he did not look so much like one. His hair was light brown and straight. Tonight he was dressed very neat, and when he came in the door he had hung a grown man's panama hat with a feather in it on the hatrack.",0
6040,"All the punch had been drunk. Her Dad was afraid she would be embarrassed, so he and her Mama had gone back to the kitchen to make lemonade. Some of the people were on the front porch and the sidewalk. She was glad to get out in the cool night air. After the hot, bright house she could smell the new autumn in the darkness.",0
6043,"'Yeah,' she said. 'Let's get going.' They started out to walk around the block. In the long dress she still felt very ritzy. 'Look yonder at Mick Kelly!' one of the kids in the dark hollered. 'Look at her!' She just walked on like she hadn't heard, but it was that Spareribs, and some day soon she would catch him. She and Harry walked fast along the dark sidewalk, and when they came to the end of the street they turned down another block.",0
6047,"'Pardon me,' he said. Then he put on his glasses and she could hear him breathe deep. 'You ought to wear your specs all the time. '",0
6050,As usual a song was in her mind. She was humming to herself. 'What's that you're singing?',0
6052,"'I reckon so.'  'Fascist?' he asked. 'What?'  'I say is that Mozart a Fascist or a Nazi?'  Mick thought a minute. 'No. They're new, and this fellow's been dead some time. '",0
6055,"She looked at Harry. The leaves against the street light made quick, freckly shadows on his face. He was excited.",0
6056,"'How come?' she asked. 'Gosh! Don't you ever read the paper? You see, it's this way----'  They had come back around the block.",0
6068,"The idea of the party was over entirely now. This was just a regular playing-out. But it was the wildest night she had ever seen. The kids had caused it. They were like a catching sickness, and their coming to the party made all the other people forget about High School and being almost grown. It was like just before you take a bath in the afternoon when you might wallow around in the back yard and get plenty dirty just for the good feel of it before getting into the tub. Everybody was a wild kid playing out on Saturday night--and she felt like the very wildest of all.",0
6070,'The ditch down the street! The ditch! The ditch!',0
6077,"* * * * *  In the quiet, secret night she was by herself again. It was not late--yellow squares of light showed in the windows of the houses along the streets. She walked slow, with her hands in her pockets and her head to one side. For a long time she walked without noticing the direction.",0
6084,"But maybe the last part of the symphony was the music she loved the best--glad and like the greatest people in the world running and springing up in a hard, free way. Wonderful music like this was the worst hurt there could be. The whole world was this symphony, and there was not enough of her to listen.",0
6085,"It was over, and she sat very stiff with her arms around her knees. Another program came on the radio and she put her fingers in her ears. The music left only this bad hurt in her, and a blankness. She could not remember any of the symphony, not even the last few notes. She tried to remember, but no sound at all came to her. Now that it was over there was only her heart like a rabbit and this terrible hurt.",0
6086,"The radio and the lights in the house were turned off. The night was very dark. Suddenly Mick began hitting her thigh with her fists. She pounded the same muscle with all her strength until the tears came down her face. But she could not feel this hard enough. The rocks under the bush were sharp. She grabbed a handful of them and began scraping them up and down on the same spot until her hand was bloody. Then she fell back to the ground and lay looking up at the night. With the fiery hurt in her leg she felt better. She was limp on the wet grass, and after a while her breath came slow and easy again.",0
6087,"Why hadn't the explorers known by looking at the sky that the world was round? The sky was curved, like the inside of a huge glass ball, very dark blue with the sprinkles of bright stars. The night was quiet. There was the smell of warm cedars. She was not trying to think of the music at all when it came back to her. The first part happened in her mind just as it had been played. She listened in a quiet, slow way and thought the notes out like a problem in geometry so she would remember. She could see the shape of the sounds very clear and she would not forget them.",0
6093,"They did not speak of this together. At night he worked downstairs while she slept, and during the morning she managed the restaurant alone. When they worked together he stayed behind the cash register and looked after the kitchen and the tables, as was their custom. They did not talk except on matters of business, but Biff would stand watching her with his face puzzled.",0
6106,"'Bartholomew----' said Lucile.  'What?'  'Don't you ever start thinking backward?'  'I don't,' said Biff. 'You know it's like I got to wear blinders all the time so I won't think sideways or in the past. All I can let myself think about is going to work every day and fixing meals and Baby's future.'",0
6113,"'I know the kids on this block,' Biff said. 'They're all right. Those Kelly kids across the street--the Crane boy----'  'You know good and well that none of them are up to Baby's level.",0
6115,"They sat for a while in the small, hot kitchenette without saying anything. Then Lucile began to cry. 'It's not like we was ever very close as sisters. We had our differences and we didn't see much of each other. Maybe it was because I was so much younger. But there's something about your own blood kin, and when anything like this happens----'  Biff clucked soothingly.",0
6122,'Can't you ever forget about that man?' 'I don't know. I guess I always been a fool about two things. And that's Leroy and Baby.',0
6127,Lucile shook her head. 'You don't have to bother about Baby. I tell her everything. She knows about the whole mess from A to Z.'  'Then if he comes back you'll let him stay here and sponge on you just as long as he pleases--like it was before?,0
6128,"' 'Yeah. I guess I would. Every time the doorbell or the phone rings, every time anybody steps up on the porch, something in the back of my mind thinks about that man. '",0
6131,"'Listen,' Lucile said. 'If I ask you a question will you promise to answer me the truth?'  'Sure.'  'No matter what it is?' Biff touched Baby's soft gold hair and laid his hand gently on the side of her little head. 'Of course.'  'It was about seven years ago.",0
6139,"In a little while they would leave for the church where the funeral would be held. In his mind he went through the motions of the ceremony. The church--riding dirge-paced behind the hearse with Lucile and Baby--the group of people standing with bowed heads in the October sunshine. Sun on the white tombstones, on the fading flowers and the canvas tent covering the newly dug grave. Then home again--and what?",0
6142,"'I feel the same way,' Biff said. Half an hour later there was a knock on the door. The car for the funeral was parked before the house. Biff and Lucile got up slowly. The three of them, with Baby in her white silk dress a little ahead, walked in solemn quietness outside.",0
6144,"'I go around,' Blount said. He leaned earnestly across the table and kept his eyes on the mute's face. 'I go all around and try to tell them. And they laugh. I can't make them understand anything. No matter what I say I can't seem to make them see the truth.'",0
6154,"Then suddenly he looked up with a surprised expression. His mouth had been open for a yawn and he snapped it shut. The radio swung into an old song that dated back to the time when he and Alice were engaged. 'Just a Baby's Prayer at Twilight.' They had taken the streetcar one Sunday to Old Sardis Lake and had rented a rowboat. At sunset he played on the mandolin while she sang. She had on a sailor hat, and when he put his arm around her waist she--Alice----  A dragnet for lost feelings.",0
6155,"Biff folded the newspapers and put them back under the counter. He stood on one foot and then the other. Finally he called across the room to Mick. 'You're not listening, are you?'",0
6158,"Twice during the evening Biff started to go over to the middle table, but each time he checked himself. After they were gone he still wondered what it was about this mute--and in the early dawn when he lay in bed he turned over questions and solutions in his mind without satisfaction. The puzzle had taken root in him. It worried him in the back of his mind and left him uneasy. There was something wrong.",0
6163,'It about our Willie. He been a bad boy and done got hisself in mighty bad trouble. And us got to do something. '  Doctor Copeland walked from the hall with rigid steps.,0
6164,"He stopped in the bedroom for his bathrobe, shawl, and slippers and went back to the kitchen. Portia was waiting for him there. The kitchen was lifeless and cold.",0
6173,He coughed and his face stiffened. He held his paper handkerchief to his mouth and it became spotted with blood. The dark skin of his face took on a greenish pallor.,0
6174,"'Course Highboy come and tell me soon as it all happened. Understand, my Highboy didn't have nothing to do with these here bad gals. He were just keeping Willie company. He so grieved about Willie he been sitting out on the street curb front of the jail ever since.' The fire-colored tears rolled down Portia's face. 'You know how us three has always been. Us haves our own plan and nothing ever went wrong with it before. Even money hasn't bothered us none. Highboy he pay the rent and I buys the food and Willie he takes care Saturday Night. Us has always been like three-piece twinses.'",0
6175,At last it was morning. The mill whistles blew for the first shift. The sun came out and brightened the clean saucepans hanging on the wall above the stove. They sat for a long time. Portia pulled at the rings on her ears until her lobes were irritated and purplish red. Doctor Copeland still held his head in his hands.,0
6180,"'We will have to. That is the only thing we can do.' 'Well, I know I ain't. '",0
6181,Portia got up from the chair. Her eyes roved distractedly around the room as though searching for something. Then abruptly she went toward the front door.,0
6182,"'Wait a minute,' said Doctor Copeland. 'Where do you intend to go now?'  'I got to work. I sure got to keep my job. I sure have to stay on with Mrs. Kelly and get my pay ever week. '",0
6184,"They went out into the cool, blue autumn morning. The men at the jail were rude to them and they were able to find out very little. Doctor Copeland then went to consult a lawyer with whom he had had dealings before. The following days were long and full of worried thoughts. At the end of three weeks the trial for William was held and he was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon. He was sentenced to nine months of hard labor and sent immediately to a prison in the northern part of the state.",0
6188,"'My people were brought from the great plains, and the dark, green jungles,' he said once to Mr. Singer. ' On the long chained journeys to the coast they died by the thousands. Only the strong survived. Chained in the foul ships that brought them here they died again. Only the hardy Negroes with will could live. Beaten and chained and sold on the block, the least of these strong ones perished again. And finally through the bitter years the strongest of my people are still here. Their sons and daughters, their grandsons and great grandsons. '",0
6194,'It going to be a real reunion. You know this the first time Grandpapa have spent the night in town for twenty years. He haven't ever slept outside of his own home except two times in his whole life. And anyway he kind of nervous at night. All during the dark he have to get up and drink water and be sure the childrens is covered up all right. I a little worried about if Grandpapa will be comfortable here. ',0
6200,' Portia laced her nervous yellow fingers together. ' There one thing I haven't told you yet. A surprise. Buddy going to be here as well as Hamilton. Buddy just come back from Mobile. He helping out on the farm now. ',0
6202,"Doctor Copeland cracked the joints of his fingers. 'Yes.'  'Well, I come to see if I can't get you to be there tomorrow at the reunion. All your childrens but Willie going to be there. Seem to me like you ought to join us. I sure will be glad if you come.'",0
6203,"Hamilton and Karl Marx and Portia--and William. Doctor Copeland removed his spectacles and pressed his fingers against his eyelids. For a minute he saw the four of them very plainly as they were a long time ago. Then he looked up and straightened his glasses on his nose. 'Thank you,' he said. 'I will come.'",0
6204,"That night he sat alone by the stove in the dark room and remembered. He thought back to the time of his childhood. His mother had been born a slave, and after freedom she was a washerwoman. His father was a preacher who had once known John Brown. They had taught him, and out of the two or three dollars they had earned each week they saved. When he was seventeen years old they had sent him North with eighty dollars hidden in his shoe. He had worked in a blacksmith's shop and as a waiter and as a bellboy in a hotel. And all the while he studied and read and went to school. His father died and his mother did not live long without him. And after ten years of struggle he was a doctor and he knew his mission and he came South again.",0
6205,"He married and made a home. He went endlessly from house to house and spoke the mission and the truth. The hopeless suffering of his people made in him a madness, a wild and evil feeling of destruction. At times he drank strong liquor and beat his head against the floor. In his heart there was a savage violence, and once he grasped the poker from the hearth and struck down his wife. She took Hamilton, Karl Marx, William, and Portia with her to her father's home. He wrestled in his spirit and fought down the evil blackness. But Daisy did not come back to him. And eight years later when she died his sons were not children any more and they did not return to him. He was left an old man in an empty house.",0
6206,"* * * * *  Promptly at five o'clock the next afternoon he arrived at the house where Portia and Highboy lived. They resided in the part of town called Sugar Hill, and the house was a narrow cottage with a porch and two rooms. From inside there was a babble of mixed voices. Doctor Copeland approached stiffly and stood in the doorway holding his shabby felt hat in his hand.",0
6209,"'Benedict Mady----' said the old man. 'Been a long time. A real long time. '  'Ain't it, though!'",0
6213,'Us had to walk a long piece 'cause the wagon too full anyways. ' Grandpapa scratched his ear with a matchstick. 'Somebody got to stay home. ',0
6217,"'It all the book of the Holy Lord. Just any place your eye fall on will do.' Portia read from the Book of Luke. She read slowly, tracing the words with her long, limp finger. The room was still. Doctor Copeland sat on the edge of the group, cracking his knuckles, his eyes wandering from one point to another. The room was very small, the air close and stuffy. The four walls were cluttered with calendars and crudely painted advertisements from magazines. On the mantel there was a vase of red paper roses. The fire on the hearth burned slowly and the wavering light from the oil lamp made shadows on the wall. Portia read with such slow rhythm that the words slept in Doctor Copeland's ears and he was drowsy. Karl Marx lay sprawled upon the floor beside the children. Hamilton and Highboy dozed. Only the old man seemed to study the meaning of the words.",0
6220,"'Many a day when I be plowing or working,' Grandpapa said slowly, 'I done thought and reasoned about the time when Jesus going to descend again to this earth. 'Cause I done always wanted it so much it seem to me like it will be while I am living. I done studied about it many a time. And this here the way I done planned it. I reason I will get to stand before Jesus with all my childrens and grandchildrens and great grandchildrens and kinfolks and friends an I say to Him, ""Jesus Christ, us is all sad colored peoples. And then he will place His holy hand upon our heads and straightway us will be white as cotton. That the plan and reasoning that been in my heart a many and a many a time. '",0
6222,"'Has any of you ever had a sign from Heaven?' asked Grandpapa. 'I has, sir,' said Highboy. 'Once when I were sick with the pneumonia I seen God's face looking out the fireplace at me. It were a large white man's face with a white beard and blue eyes. '",0
6223,"'I seen a ghost,' said one of the children--the girl. 'Once I seen----' began the little boy. Grandpapa held up his hand. 'You childrens hush. You, Celia--and you, Whitman--it now the time for you to listen but not be heard,' he said. 'Only one time has I had a real sign. And this here the way it come about. It were in the summer of last year, and hot. I were trying to dig up the roots of that big oak stump near the hog-pen and when I leaned down a kind of catch, a misery, come suddenly in the small of my back. I straightened up and then all around went dark. I were holding my hand to my back and looking up at the sky when suddenly I seen this little angel. It were a little white girl angel--look to me about the size of a field pea--with yellow hair and a white robe. Just flying around near the sun. After that I come in the house and prayed. I studied the Bible for three days before I went out in the field again. '",0
6224,"Doctor Copeland felt the old evil anger in him. The words rose inchoately to his throat and he could not speak them. They would listen to the old man. Yet to words of reason they would not attend. These are my people, he tried to tell himself--but because he was dumb this thought did not help him now. He sat tense and sullen.",0
6227,"'Drink plenty of water,' said Doctor Copeland. ' And rest as much as you can.'",0
6235,"'Sorry,' said the white man. Doctor Copeland put his hand on the banister and passed on. [4] 'Who was that?' Jake Blount asked. 'Who was the tall, thin colored man that just come out of here? '",0
6244,Singer agreed with him. The room was comfortable in a homey way. Singer brought out from the closet the tin box in which he kept crackers and fruit and cheese. He selected an orange and peeled it slowly. He pulled off shreds of pith until the fruit was transparent in the sun. He sectioned the orange and divided the plugs between them. Jake ate two sections at a time and with a loud whoosh spat the seeds into the fire. Singer ate his share slowly and deposited his seeds neatly in the palm of one hand. They opened two more ales.,0
6246,"The red corded vein in Jake's forehead swelled angrily. He grasped the scuttle on the hearth and rattled an avalanche of coal on the fire. His foot had gone to sleep, and he stamped it so hard that the floor shook.",0
6254,"In the streetcar Jake drank Coca-Cola with whiskey added. He talked. The winter dawn was white and smoky and cold. He looked with drunken urgency into the drawn, yellow faces of the men. Often he was laughed at, and when this happened he held his stunted body very straight and spoke scornfully in words of many syllables. He stuck his little finger out from his glass and haughtily twisted his mustache. And if he was still laughed at he sometimes fought. He swung his big brown fists with crazed violence and sobbed aloud.",0
6257,"* * * * *  The fire had died down. Singer was playing a game of fools with himself at the table. Jake had been asleep. He awoke with a nervous quiver. He raised his head and turned to Singer. ' Yeah,' he said as though in answer to a sudden question. 'Some of us are Communists. But not all of us----. Myself, I'm not a member of the Communist Party. Because in the first place I never knew but one of them. You can bum around for years and not meet Communists. Around here there's no office where you can go up and say you want to join--and if there is I never heard of it. And you just don't take off for New York and join. As I say I never knew but one--and he was a seedy little teetotaler whose breath stunk. We had a fight. Not that I hold that against the Communists. The main fact is I don't think so much of Stalin and Russia. I hate every damn country and government there is. But even so maybe I ought to joined up with the Communists first place. I'm not certain one way or the other. What do you think?'",0
6262,"Singer looked up at the clock and indicated the time--half-past twelve. He took his watch, his silver pencil and pad, his cigarettes and matches from the mantel and distributed them among his pockets. It was dinner-time.",0
6268,'The things they have done to us! The truths they have turned into lies. The ideals they have fouled and made vile. Take Jesus. He was one of us. He knew. When he said that it is harder for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God--he damn well meant just what he said. But look what the Church has done to Jesus during the last two thousand years. What they have made of him. How they have turned every word he spoke for their own vile ends. Jesus would be framed and in jail if he was living today. Jesus would be one who really knows. Me and Jesus would sit across the table and I would look at him and he would look at me and we would both know that the other knew. Me and Jesus and Karl Marx could all sit at a table and----  'And look what has happened to our freedom.,0
6270,"The vein in Jake's forehead throbbed wildly. His mouth worked convulsively. Singer sat up, alarmed. Jake tried to speak again and the words choked in his mouth. A shudder passed through his body. He sat down in the chair and pressed his trembling lips with his fingers. Then he said huskily:  'It's this way, Singer.",0
6272,"The fire shadows lapped against the walls. The dark, shadowy waves rose higher and the room took on motion. The room rose and fell and all balance was gone. Alone Jake felt himself sink downward, slowly in wavelike motions downward into a shadowed ocean. In helplessness and terror he strained his eyes, but he could see nothing except the dark and scarlet waves that roared hungrily over him. Then at last he made out the thing which he sought. The mute's face was faint and very far away. Jake closed his eyes.",0
6274,"Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth. He read the message twice and looked anxiously up and down the street. No one was in sight. After a few minutes of puzzled deliberation he took from his pocket a thick red pencil and wrote carefully beneath the inscription:  Whoever wrote the above meet me here tomorrow at noon.",0
6275,"Wednesday, November 29. Or the next day. At twelve o'clock the next day he waited before the wall. Now and then he walked impatiently to the corner to look up and down the streets. No one came. After an hour he had to leave for the show.",0
6284,The kids still hung around in front of the house. Bubber had put his slingshot in his pocket and now he played with the rifle. Spareribs was ten years old and his father had died the month before and this had been his father's gun. All the smaller kids loved to handle that rifle. Every few minutes Bubber would haul the gun up to his shoulder. He took aim and made a loud pow sound.,0
6286,"Mick finished the cornbread and looked around for something to do. Harry Minowitz was sitting on his front porch banisters with the newspaper. She was glad to see him. For a joke she threw up her arm and hollered to him, 'Heil!'",0
6289,"'Shucks. You got it mixed up,' she said. 'It's Catholics you're thinking about. Catholics buy a pistol for a baby soon as it's born. Some day the Catholics mean to start a war and kill everybody else. '",0
6296,"I like that one a whole lot about them German kids going out in the forest and coming to this house made out of all different kinds of candy and the witch. I like a story with something to eat in it.' 'I'll look for one,' said Mick.",0
6302,"Bubber rested the end of the rifle on the ground. The big gun was too heavy for him. As he watched Baby walk off down the street he kept pulling the straggly bangs of his hair. 'That sure is a cute little pink pocketbook,' he said.",0
6308,"'A person's got to fight for every single thing they get,' she said slowly. ' And I've noticed a lot of times that the farther down a kid comes in the family the better the kid really is. Youngest kids are always the toughest. I'm pretty hard 'cause I've a lot of them on top of me. Bubber--he looks sick, and likes pretty things, but he's got guts underneath that. If all this is true Ralph sure ought to be a real strong one when he's old enough to get around. Even though he's just seventeen months old I can read something hard and tough in that Ralph's face already. '",0
6309,Ralph looked around because he knew he was being talked about. Spareribs sat down on the ground and grabbed Ralph's hat off his head and shook it in his face to tease him. 'All right!' Mick said. 'You know what I'll do to you if you start him to cry. You just better watch out. ',0
6312,"Baby walked toward them slowly. She had been given a prize box of popcorn candy and was reaching in the box for the prize. She walked in that same prissy, dainty way. You could tell that she knew they were all looking at her.",0
6318,So much happened in a second. Bubber screamed and dropped the gun and ran. She stood with her hands up to her face and screamed too. Then there were many people. Her Dad was the first to get there. He carried Baby into the house.,0
6319,"'She's dead,' said Spareribs. 'She's shot through the eyes. I seen her face.'",0
6321,Baby looked like a pretty little doll on the bed. Except for the blood she did not seem hurt. The doctor bent over and looked at her head. After he finished they took Baby out on a stretcher. Mrs. Wilson and her Dad got into the ambulance with her.,0
6322,The house was still quiet. Everybody had forgotten about Bubber. He was nowhere around. An hour passed. Her Mama and Hazel and Etta and all the boarders waited in the front room. Mister Singer stood in the doorway. After a long time her Dad came home. He said Baby wouldn't die but that her skull was fractured. He asked for Bubber. Nobody knew where he was. It was dark outside. They called Bubber in the back yard and in the street. They sent Spareribs and some other boys out to hunt for him. It looked like Bubber had gone clear out of the neighborhood. Harry went around to a house where they thought he might be.,0
6327,"He didn't answer, but she knew he was there. It was like she could smell him. She swung up on the lowest branch and climbed slowly. She was really mad with that kid and would have to teach him a lesson. When she reached the tree house she spoke to him again--and still there wasn't any answer. She climbed into the big box and felt around the edges. At last she touched him. He was scrouged up in a corner and his legs were trembling. He had been holding his breath, and when she touched him the sobs and the breath came out all at once.",0
6336,"Her Dad's footsteps stopped. 'It was deliberate,' he said. 'It's not like the kid was just fooling with the gun and it went off by accident. Everybody who saw it said he took deliberate aim.'",0
6345,But she couldn't miss anything. Mrs. Wilson would be there in a few minutes and she had to know what was going on. Then she would run out and tell Bubber that all the things she said were lies. And he would really have learned the lesson he had coming to him.,0
6347,"'I've come to talk over all this with you,' Mrs. Wilson said. The front room looked tacky and dirty and she saw Mister Brannon notice everything. The mashed celluloid doll and the beads and junk Ralph played with were scattered on the floor. There was beer on her Dad's workbench, and the pillows on the bed where her Dad and Mama slept were right gray.",0
6354,"'I haven't come here with any lawyer to sue you. Bartholomew--Mister Brannon--and I talked it over when we came and we just about agree on the main points. In the first place, I want to do the fair, honest thing--and in the second place, I don't want Baby's name mixed up in no common lawsuit at her age. '",0
6359,Mrs. Wilson spoke hard-boiled. 'You heard what I said. Long as your kid shot my Baby she certainly ought to have every advantage until she gets well. ',0
6364,She scrambled down the tree and ran to the front porch. Mrs. Wilson was leaving and they had all come out to the front steps with her. 'Dad!' she said. 'We got to do something about Bubber. He's run away. I'm sure he left our block. We all got to get out and hunt him. ',0
6368,Mister Brannon had borrowed an automobile. He and Mister Singer and Mick's Dad got into the car with her and Portia. Nobody knew what Bubber was feeling except her. Nobody knew he had really run away like he was escaping to save his life.,0
6370,"'He been here,' Portia suddenly said. 'I can tell somebody been in here. '",0
6380,"They stopped the automobile and he ran to get in. He couldn't see who they were, and his face had the squint-eyed look it always had when he took aim with a marble. Her Dad held him by the collar. He hit with his fists and kicked. Then he had the butcher knife in his hand. Their Dad yanked it away from him just in time. He fought like a little tiger in a trap, but finally they got him into the car. Their Dad held him in his lap on the way home and Bubber sat very stiff, not leaning against anything.",0
6382,There were never any kind of yells like the ones Bubber made. The veins in his neck stood out and his fists were hard as little rocks. 'You can't get me! Nobody can get me!' he kept yelling.,0
6386,"She was awake a long time. In the dark she put her arms around him and held him very close. She touched him all over and kissed him everywhere. He was so soft and little and there was this salty, boy smell about him. The love she felt was so hard that she had to squeeze him to her until her arms were tired. In her mind she thought about Bubber and music together. It was like she could never do anything good enough for him. She would never hit him or even tease him again. She slept all night with her arms around his head. Then in the morning when she woke up he was gone.",0
6392,"'Father, you been scrouched over that desk since five o'clock. You got no business to be up. You ought to stayed in bed until time for the to-do.'",0
6395,"The letter will get here on Monday or Tuesday. But last week he didn't write. Course I not really anxious. Willie--he always so good-natured and sweet I know he going to be all right. He been transferred from the prison to the chain gang and they going to work up somewhere north of Atlanta. Two weeks ago he wrote this here letter to say they going to attend a church service today, and he done asked me to send him his suit of clothes and his red tie. '",0
6405,"Doctor Copeland went to the filing case in his bedroom where he kept notes on all of his patients. He took out the card marked 'Mrs. Dan Davis and Family' and glanced through the notations until he reached Lancy's name. The date was four years ago. The entries on him were written with more care than the others and in ink: 'thirteen years old--past puberty. Unsuccessful attempt self-emasculation. Over-sexed and hyperthyroid. Wept boisterously during two visits, though little pain. Voluble--very glad to talk though paranoiac. Environment fair with one exception. See Lucy Davis--mother washerwoman. Intelligent and well worth watching and all possible help. Keep contact. Fee: $1 (?)'  'It is a difficult decision to make this year,' he said to Portia. '",0
6406,"But I suppose I will have to confer the award on Lancy Davis.' 'If you done decide', then--come tell me about some of these here presents. '",0
6412,"The box contained nothing but junk--a headless doll, some dirty lace, a rabbitskin. Doctor Copeland scrutinized each article. 'Do not throw them away. There is use for everything. These are the gifts from our guests who have nothing better to contribute. I will find some purpose for them later. '  'Then suppose you look over these here boxes and sacks so I can commence to tie them up.",0
6413,There ain't going to be room here in the kitchen. Time they all pile in for the refreshments. I just going to put these here presents out on the back steps and in the yard.',0
6416,Portia said. Twelve dollars!'  'I felt that it was proper to ask him. He is not like other people of the Caucasian race.',0
6417,"'You right,' Portia said. ' But I keep thinking about my Willie. I sure do wish he could enjoy this here party today. And I sure do wish I could get a letter from him. It just prey on my mind. But here! Us got to quit this here talking and get ready. It mighty near time for the party to come.'",0
6427,"'One hundred and twenty years ago another man was born in the country that is known as Germany--a country far across the Atlantic Ocean. This man understood as did Jesus. But his thoughts were not concerned with Heaven or the future of the dead. His mission was for the living. For the great masses of human beings who work and suffer and work until they die. For people who take in washing and work as cooks, who pick cotton and work at the hot dye vats of factories. His mission was for us, and the name of this man is Karl Marx.",0
6428,"'Karl Marx was a wise man. He studied and worked and understood the world around him. He said that the world was divided into two classes, the poor and the rich. For every rich man there were a thousand poor people who worked for this rich man to make him richer. He did not divide the world into Negroes or white people or Chinese--to Karl Marx it seemed that being one of the millions of poor people or one of the few rich was more important to a man than the color of his skin. The life mission of Karl Marx was to make all human beings equal and to divide the great wealth of the world so that there would be no poor or rich and each person would have his share. This is one of the commandments Karl Marx left to us: ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. '  A wrinkled, yellow palm waved timidly from the hall.",0
6429,'Were he the Mark in the Bible?'  Doctor Copeland explained. He spelled the two names and cited dates. 'Are there any more questions? I wish each one of you to feel free to start or enter into my discussion. ',0
6430,'I presume Mr. Marx was a Christian church man?' asked the preacher. 'He believed in the holiness of the human spirit.' 'Were he a white man?'  'Yes.,0
6434,"'But don't clay for these here bricks cost money? And don't it take money to rent land and raise crops on?' 'That is a good point,' said Doctor Copeland. 'Land, clay, timber--those things are called natural resources. Man does not make these natural resources--man only develops them, only uses them for work. Therefore should any one person or group of persons own these things? How can a man own ground and space and sunlight and rain for crops? How can a man say ""this is mine"" about those things and refuse to let others share them? Therefore Marx says that these natural resources should belong to everyone, not divided into little pieces but used by all the people according to their ability to work. It is like this. Say a man died and left his mule to his four sons. The sons would not wish to cut up the mule into four parts and each take his share. They would own and work the mule together. That is the way Marx says all of the natural resources should be owned--not by one group of rich people but by all the workers of the world as a whole.",0
6443,"The laughter in the room was uneasy.  'Listen! One out of five of us labors to build roads, or to take care of the sanitation of this city, or works in a sawmill or on a farm. Another one out of the five is unable to get any work at all. But the other three out of this five--the greatest number of our people? Many of us cook for those who are incompetent to prepare the food that they themselves eat. Many work a lifetime tending flower gardens for the pleasure of one or two people. Many of us polish slick waxed floors of fine houses. Or we drive automobiles for rich people who are too lazy to drive themselves. We spend our lives doing thousands of jobs that are of no real use to anybody. We labor and all of our labor is wasted. Is that service? No, that is slavery.",0
6447,'People of the Negro race! We bring with us all the riches of the human mind and soul. We offer the most precious of all gifts. And our offerings are held in scorn and contempt. Our gifts are trampled in the mud and made useless. We are put to labor more useless than the work of beasts. Negroes! We must arise and be whole again! We must be free!',0
6451,'Attention!' he called. 'We will save ourselves. But not by prayers of mourning. Not by indolence or strong drink. Not by the pleasures of the body or by ignorance. Not by submission and humbleness. But by pride. By dignity. By becoming hard and strong. We must build strength for our real true purpose.',0
6452,"He stopped abruptly and held himself very straight. 'Each year at this time we illustrate in our small way the first commandment from Karl Marx. Every one of you at this gathering has brought in advance some gift. Many of you have denied yourselves comfort that the needs of others may be lessened. Each of you has given according to his best ability, without thought to the value of the gift he will receive in return. It is natural for us to share with each other. We have long realized that it is more blessed to give than to receive. The words of Karl Marx have always been known in our hearts: ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. '  Doctor Copeland was silent a long time as though his words were complete.",0
6455,Someone nagged at his elbow: 'He the one your Buddy named for?' He answered yes. Lancy Davis followed him with questions; he answered yes to everything. The joy made him feel like a drunken man. To teach and exhort and explain to his people--and to have them understand. That was the best of all. To speak the truth and be attended.,0
6477,They had no friends. Sometimes they would meet other mutes--there were three of them with whom they became acquainted during the ten years. But something always happened. One moved to another state the week after they met him. Another was married and had six children and did not talk with his hands. But it was their relation with the third of these acquaintances that Singer remembered when his friend was gone.,0
6481,"Midnight had passed when the thing happened that ruined the festive party. Antonapoulos returned from one of his trips to the closet and his face had a glowering look. He sat on his bed and began to stare repeatedly at their new friend with expressions of offense and great disgust. Singer tried to make eager conversation to hide this strange behavior, but the Greek was persistent. Carl huddled in a chair, nursing his bony knees, fascinated and bewildered by the grimaces of the big Greek. His face was flushed and he swallowed timidly. Singer could ignore the situation no longer, so at last he asked Antonapoulos if his stomach pained him or if he perhaps felt bad and wished to go to sleep. Antonapoulos shook his head. He pointed to Carl and began to make all the gestures of obscenity which he knew. The disgust on his face was terrible to see. Carl was small with fear. At last the big Greek ground his teeth and rose from his chair. Hurriedly Carl picked up his cap and left the room. Singer followed him down the stairs. He did not know how to explain his friend to this stranger. Carl stood hunched in the doorway downstairs, limp, with his peaked cap pulled down over his face. At last they shook hands and Carl went away.",0
6483,"Then years later there was the time Antonapoulos took the rent money from the vase on the mantelpiece and spent it all on the slot machines. And the summer afternoon Antonapoulos went downstairs naked to get the paper. He suffered so from the summer heat. They bought an electric refrigerator on the installment plan, and Antonapoulos would suck the cubes of ice constantly and even let a few of them melt in the bed with him as he slept. And the time Antonapoulos got drunk and threw a bowl of macaroni in his face.",0
6484,Those ugly memories wove through his thoughts during the first months like bad threads through a carpet. And then they were gone. All the times that they had been unhappy were forgotten. For as the year went on his thoughts of his friend spiraled deeper until he dwelt only with the Antonapoulos whom he alone could know.,0
6493,"At first he had not understood the four people at all. They talked and they talked--and as the months went on they talked more and more. He became so used to their lips that he understood each word they said. And then after a while he knew what each one of them would say before he began, because the meaning was always the same.",0
6496,When he walked up and down the floor of his room he would crack the joints of his fingers and jerk at them until they ached. Or he would strike the palm of one hand with the fist of the other. And then sometimes when he was alone and his thoughts were with his friend his hands would begin to shape the words before he knew about it. Then when he realized he was like a man caught talking aloud to himself. It was almost as though he had done some moral wrong. The shame and the sorrow mixed together and he doubled his hands and put them behind him. But they would not let him rest.,0
6518,"Each person addressed his words mainly to the mute. Their thoughts seemed to converge in him as the spokes of a wheel lead to the center hub. 'The cold has been very unusual,' Biff said finally. 'The other day I was looking through some old records and I found that in the year 1919 the thermometer got down to ten degrees Fahrenheit. It was only sixteen degrees this morning, and that's the coldest since the big freeze that year. '",0
6520,* * * * *  The fact that Antonapoulos could not read did not prevent Singer from writing to him.,0
6529,"They are all very busy people. In fact they are so busy that it will be hard for you to picture them. I do not mean that they work at their jobs all day and night but that they have much business in their minds always that does not let them rest. They come up to my room and talk to me until I do not understand how a person can open and shut his or her mouth so much without being weary. (However, the New York Café owner is different--he is not just like the others. He has a very black beard so that he has to shave twice daily, and he owns one of these electric razors. He watches. The others all have something they hate. And they all have something they love more than eating or sleeping or wine or friendly company. That is why they are always so busy.)",0
6546,"Tears of nervousness and fear swam in Singer's eyes. The young woman began deliberately to write on a pad of paper, and he could not restrain himself from twisting around to see immediately what was being written about his friend. Mr. Antonapoulos has been transferred to the infirmary. He is ill with nephritis. I will have someone show you the way.",0
6550,"Singer raised his hands timidly and began to speak. His strong, skilled fingers shaped the signs with loving precision. He spoke of the cold and of the long months alone. He mentioned old memories, the cat that had died, the store, the place where he lived. At each pause Antonapoulos nodded graciously. He spoke of the four people and the long visits to his room. The eyes of his friend were moist and dark, and in them he saw the little rectangled pictures of himself that he had watched a thousand times. The warm blood flowed back to his face and his hands quickened. He spoke at length of the black man and the one with the jerking mustache and the girl. The designs of his hands shaped faster and faster. Antonapoulos nodded with slow gravity. Eagerly Singer leaned closer and he breathed with long, deep breaths and in his eyes there were bright tears.",0
6560,"The interne in charge of the ward allowed Singer to stay for an hour past the visiting time. Then at last he held out his thin, hairy wrist and showed him his watch. The patients were settled for sleep. Singer's hand faltered. He grasped his friend by the arm and looked intently into his eyes as he used to do each morning when they parted for work. Finally Singer backed himself out of the room. At the doorway his hands signed a broken farewell and then clenched into fists.",0
6563,Biff thought also of death. A curious incident occurred. One day while rummaging through the bathroom closet he found a bottle of Agua Florida that he had overlooked when taking Lucile the rest of Alice's cosmetics. Meditatively he held the bottle of perfume in his hands. It was four months now since her death--and each month seemed as long and full of leisure as a year. He seldom thought of her.,0
6566,"All of this he had changed. He traded the iron bed for a studio couch. There was a thick red rug on the floor, and he had bought a beautiful cloth of Chinese blue to hang on the side of the wall where the cracks were worst. He had unsealed the fireplace and kept it laid with pine logs. Over the mantel was a small photograph of Baby and a colored picture of a little boy in velvet holding a ball in his hands. A glassed case in the corner held the curios he had collected--specimens of butterflies, a rare arrowhead, a curious rock shaped like a human profile. Blue-silk cushions were on the studio couch, and he had borrowed Lucile's sewing-machine to make deep red curtains for the windows. He loved the room. It was both luxurious and sedate. On the table there was a little Japanese pagoda with glass pendants that tinkled with strange musical tones in a draught.",0
6570,Then from noon until five in the morning he worked downstairs. And all day Sunday. The business was losing money. There were many slack hours. Still at meal-times the place was usually full and he saw hundreds of acquaintances every day as he stood guard behind the cash register.,0
6572,"'I am an eighth part Jew,' Biff said. ' My Mother's grandfather was a Jew from Amsterdam. But all the rest of my folks that I know about were Scotch-Irish.'",0
6578,Blount smacked his hands down on the counter. They were warm and meaty and rough. 'Beer. And one of them little packages of cheese crackers with peanut butter in the inside. ',0
6582,"I wouldn't park myself behind that cash box if you was to give me the whole damn place, lock, stock, and barrel. ' There he was. It was irritating. He could never have friends or even get along with people.",0
6583,"'Talk sense,' Biff said. 'Be serious. '",0
6588,"'Or maybe around 1775. ' 'That was a good time to be living,' Biff agreed.",0
6591,"Blount leaned over suddenly and smelled in Biff's face. 'Perfume?'  'Shaving lotion,' Biff said composedly. He could not keep Blount longer. The fellow was ready to go. He would come in with Singer later. It was always like this. He wanted to draw Blount out completely so that he could understand certain questions concerning him. But Blount would never really talk--only to the mute. It was a most peculiar thing.",0
6594,"'Hey, Louis!' he called. 'Take this stuff out the window. And bring me that red pottery bowl and some fruit.'",0
6597,"'Say hello to Uncle Biff, Hon,' Lucile prompted. Baby bridled fretfully. 'Hello to Unca Biff Hon,' she sassed.",0
6601,"'We just been to Sunday School and church. Baby, say the verse from the Bible you learned for your Uncle Biff.' The kid hung back and pouted. 'Jesus wept,' she said finally. The scorn that she put in the two words made it sound like a terrible thing.",0
6613,"He walked slowly down the sidewalk opposite the house where she lived. Last Sunday she had been reading the funny papers on the front steps. But this time as he glanced swiftly toward the house he saw she was not there. Biff tilted the brim of his felt hat down over his eyes. Perhaps she would come into the place later. Often on Sunday after supper she came for a hot cocoa and stopped for a while at the table where Singer was sitting. On Sunday she wore a different outfit from the blue skirt and sweater she wore on other days. Her Sunday dress was wine-colored silk with a dingy lace collar. Once she had had on stockings--with runs in them. Always he wanted to set her up to something, to give to her. And not only a sundae or some sweet to eat--but something real. That was all he wanted for himself--to give to her. Biff's mouth hardened. He had done nothing wrong but in him he felt a strange guilt. Why? The dark guilt in all men, unreckoned and without a name.",0
6614,"On the way home Biff found a penny lying half-concealed by rubbish in the gutter. Thriftily he picked it up, cleaned the coin with his handkerchief, and dropped it into the black pocket purse he carried. It was four o'clock when he reached the restaurant. Business was stagnant. There was not a single customer in the place.",0
6621,He felt suddenly embarrassed. Maybe Harry would think it was none of his business. Which it wasn't anyway. He started to turn aside and then thought of something.,0
6624,"Biff shut himself in his room downstairs. This was the place where he kept his files. The room had only one small window that looked out on the side alley, and the air was musty and cold. Huge stacks of newspapers rose up to the ceiling. A home-made filing case covered one wall. Near the door there was an old-fashioned rocking-chair and a small table laid with a pair of shears, a dictionary, and a mandolin. Because of the piles of newspaper it was impossible to take more than two steps in any direction. Biff rocked himself in the chair and languidly plucked the strings of the mandolin. His eyes closed and he began to sing in a doleful voice:  I went to the animal fair.",0
6627,"Lucile always understood the whole set-up. She knew the kind of woman Alice was. Maybe she knew about him, too. Lucile would urge them to get a divorce. And she did all a person could to try to straighten out their messes.",0
6628,"Biff winced suddenly. He jerked his hands from the strings of the mandolin so that a phrase of music was chopped off. He sat tense in his chair. Then suddenly he laughed quietly to himself. What had made him come across this? Ah, Lordy Lordy Lord! It was the day of his twenty-ninth birthday, and Lucile had asked him to drop by her apartment when he finished with an appointment at the dentist's. He expected from this some little remembrance--a plate of cherry tarts or a good shirt. She met him at the door and blindfolded his eyes before he entered. Then she said she would be back in a second. In the silent room he listened to her footsteps and when she had reached the kitchen he broke wind. He stood in the room with his eyes blindfolded and pooted. Then all at once he knew with horror he was not alone. There was a titter and soon great rolling whoops of laughter deafened him. At that minute Lucile came back and undid his eyes. She held a caramel cake on a platter. The room was full of people. Leroy and that bunch and Alice, of course. He wanted to crawl up the wall. He stood there with his bare face hanging out, burning hot all over. They kidded him and the next hour was almost as bad as the death of his mother--the way he took it. Later that night he drank a quart of whiskey. And for weeks after----Motherogod!",0
6631,Broken pictures lay like a scattered jigsaw puzzle in his head. Alice soaping in the bathtub. Mussolini's mug. Mick pulling the baby in a wagon. A roast turkey on display. Blount's mouth. The face of Singer. He felt himself waiting. The room was completely dark. From the kitchen he could hear Louis singing.,0
6634,"Bill had a job in a bottling plant and made ten dollars a week. Hazel worked as a helper in a beauty parlor for eight dollars. Etta sold tickets at a movie for five dollars. Each of them paid half of what they earned for their keep. Then the house had six boarders at five dollars a head. And Mister Singer, who paid his rent very prompt. With what their Dad picked up it all came to about two hundred dollars a month--and out of that they had to feed the six boarders pretty good and feed the family and pay rent for the whole house and keep up the payments on the furniture.",0
6635,George and her didn't get any lunch money now. She had to stop the music lessons. Portia saved the leftovers from the dinner for her and George to eat after school. All the time they had their meals in the kitchen. Whether Bill and Hazel and Etta sat with the boarders or ate in the kitchen depended on how much food there was. In the kitchen they had grits and grease and side meat and coffee for breakfast. For supper they had the same thing along with whatever could be spared from the dining-room. The big kids griped whenever they had to eat in the kitchen. And sometimes she and George were downright hungry for two or three days.,0
6640,"In January she began a certain very wonderful piece called 'This Thing I Want, I Know Not What.' It was a beautiful and marvelous song--very slow and soft. At first she had started to write a poem along with it, but she couldn't think of ideas to fit the music. Also it was hard to get a word for the third line to rhyme with what. This new song made her feel sad and excited and happy all at once. Music beautiful as this was hard to work on. Any song was hard to write. Something she could hum in two minutes meant a whole week's work before it was down in the notebook--after she had figured up the scale and the time and every note.",0
6641,"She had to concentrate hard and sing it many times. Her voice was always hoarse. Her Dad said this was because she had bawled so much when she was a baby. Her Dad would have to get up and walk with her every night when she was Ralph's age. The only thing would hush her, he always said, was for him to beat the coal scuttle with a poker and sing 'Dixie.'",0
6648,"But with Mister Singer there was a difference. The way she felt about him came on her slowly, and she could not think back and realize just how it happened. The other people had been ordinary, but Mister Singer was not. The first day he rang the doorbell to ask about a room she had looked a long time into his face. She had opened the door and read over the card he handed her. Then she called her Mama and went back in the kitchen to tell Portia and Bubber about him. She followed him and her Mama up the stairs and watched him poke the mattress on the bed and roll up the shades to see if they worked. The day he moved she sat on the front porch banisters and watched him get out of the ten-cent taxi with his suitcase and his chessboard. Then later she listened to him thump around in his room and imagined about him. The rest came in a gradual way. So that now there was this secret feeling between them. She talked to him more than she had ever talked to a person before. And if he could have talked he would have told her many things. It was like he was some kind of a great teacher, only because he was a mute he did not teach. In the bed at night she planned about how she was an orphan and lived with Mister Singer--just the two of them in a foreign house where in the winter it would snow. Maybe in a little Switzerland town with the high glaciers and the mountains all around. Where rocks were on top of all the houses and the roofs were steep and pointed. Or in France where the people carried home bread from the store without its being wrapped. Or in the foreign country of Norway by the gray winter ocean.",0
6649,In the morning the first thing she would think of him. Along with music. When she put on her dress she wondered where she would see him that day. She used some of Etta's perfume or a drop of vanilla so that if she met him in the hall she would smell good. She went to school late so she could see him come down the stairs on his way to work. And in the afternoon and night she never left the house if he was there.,0
6653,"'You see, there's just two things nowadays,' he said. He liked to surprise people and sometimes she didn't know how to answer him. 'It's the truth, there's just two things ahead nowadays. '",0
6661,"'I hate Mister Brannon,' Mick said. It was true that even though he never said anything mean to her he always spoke in a rough, funny way. He must have known all along about the pack of chewing-gum she and George swiped that time. And then why would he ask her how her business was coming along--like he did up in Mister Singer's room? Maybe he thought they took things regular. And they didn't. They certainly did not. Only once a little water-color set from the ten-cent store. And a nickel pencil-sharpener.",0
6666,Harry unlaced his shoe and pulled the broken string to even lengths so he could tie it in a bow again. 'Listen'--he rubbed his glasses on his lumberjack in a nervous way--'You needn't mention to him what I said. I mean I doubt if he would remember me. He don't talk to me. He just talks to Mr. Singer. He might think it was funny if you--you know what I mean.',0
6670,"'What?'  'You remember when you first began to read the newspapers and think about the things you read?'  'Sure.'  'I used to be a Fascist. I used to think I was. It was this way. You know all the pictures of the people our age in Europe marching and singing songs and keeping step together. I used to think that was wonderful. All of them pledged to each other and with one leader. All of them with the same ideals and marching in step together. I didn't worry much about what was happening to the Jewish minorities because I didn't want to think about it. And because at the time I didn't want to think like I was Jewish. You see, I didn't know. I just looked at the pictures and read what it said underneath and didn't understand. I never knew what an awful thing it was. I thought I was a Fascist. Of course later on I found out different. '",0
6671,"His voice was bitter against himself and kept changing from a man's voice to a young boy's. 'Well, you didn't realize then----' she said. 'It was a terrible transgression. A moral wrong. '",0
6672,"That was the way he was. Everything was either very right or very wrong--with no middle way. It was wrong for anyone under twenty to touch beer or wine or smoke a cigarette. It was a terrible sin for a person to cheat on a test, but not a sin to copy homework. It was a moral wrong for girls to wear lipstick or sun-backed dresses. It was a terrible sin to buy anything with a German or Japanese label, no matter if it cost only a nickel.",0
6676,"What was it made her act like she suddenly did? Maybe it was remembering the times when they were younger. Maybe it was because the sadness made her feel queer. But anyway all of a sudden she gave Harry a push that nearly knocked him off the steps. 'S.O.B. to your Grandmother,' she hollered to him. Then she ran. That was what kids used to say in the neighborhood when they picked a fight. Harry stood up and looked surprised. He settled his glasses on his nose and watched her for a second. Then he ran back to the alley.",0
6687,"February came. The weather turned milder, then hot. The sun glared down with hard brilliance. Birds sang in the bare trees and children played out of doors barefoot and naked to the waist. The nights were torrid as in midsummer. Then after a few days winter was upon the town again. The mild skies darkened. A chill rain fell and the air turned dank and bitterly cold. In the town the Negroes suffered badly. Supplies of fuel had been exhausted and there was a struggle everywhere for warmth. An epidemic of pneumonia raged through the wet, narrow streets, and for a week Doctor Copeland slept at odd hours, fully clothed. Still no word came from William. Portia had written four times and Doctor Copeland twice.",0
6688,"During most of the day and night he had no time to think. But occasionally he found a chance to rest for a moment at home. He would drink a pot of coffee by the kitchen stove and a deep uneasiness would come in him. Five of his patients had died. And one of these was Augustus Benedict Mady Lewis, the little deaf-mute. He had been asked to speak at the burial service, but as it was his rule not to attend funerals he was unable to accept this invitation. The five patients had not been lost because of any negligence on his part. The blame was in the long years of want which lay behind. The diets of cornbread and sowbelly and syrup, the crowding of four and five persons to a single room. The death of poverty. He brooded on this and drank coffee to stay awake. Often he held his hand to his chin, for recently a slight tremor in the nerves of his neck made his head nod unsteadily when he was tired.",0
6694,'Once I mentioned to you this here Buster Johnston were at the prison with Willie. Us knowed him before. He were sent home yesdiddy.'  'So?'  'Buster been crippled for life.',0
6699,'...and their feets swelled up and they lay there and struggle on the floor and holler out. And nobody come. They hollered there for three days and three nights and nobody come.',0
6700,"'I am deaf,' said Doctor Copeland. 'I cannot understand.' 'They put our Willie and them boys in this here ice-cold room. There were a rope hanging down from the ceiling. They taken their shoes off and tied their bare feets to this rope. Willie and them boys lay there with their backs on the floor and their feets in the air. And their feets swelled up and they struggle on the floor and holler out. It were ice-cold in the room and their feets froze. Their feets swelled up and they hollered for three nights and three days. And nobody come.'",0
6701,"Doctor Copeland pressed his head with his hands, but still the steady trembling would not stop. 'I cannot hear what you say.' 'Then at last they come to get them. They quickly taken Willie and them boys to the sick ward and their legs were all swelled and froze. Gangrene. They sawed off both our Willie's feets. Buster Johnson lost one foot and the other boy got well. But our Willie--he crippled for life now. Both his feet sawed off.'",0
6703,'Crippled?' he asked. 'William?'  Portia knocked her head on the table and the blows had a rhythm like the slow beat of a drum and his heart took up this rhythm also. Quietly the words came alive and fitted to the meaning and he understood.,0
6704,'When will they send him home?' Portia leaned her drooping head on her arm. 'Buster don't know that. Soon afterward they separate all three of them in different places. They sent Buster to another camp. Since Willie only haves a few more months he think he liable to be home soon now. ',0
6706,'William----' Doctor Copeland said. As he pronounced the name his teeth bit deeply into his tongue and he moved his jaw with pain. They sat for a long while. Portia held his hand. The bleak morning light made the windows gray. Outside it was still raining.,0
6708,"He waited for the black, terrible anger as though for some beast out of the night. But it did not come to him. His bowels seemed weighted with lead, and he walked slowly and lingered against fences and the cold, wet walls of buildings by the way. Descent into the depths until at last there was no further chasm below. He touched the solid bottom of despair and there took ease.",0
6711,"'You think some hot coffee would make you feel better?'  Doctor Copeland looked into her face but gave no sign that he heard. They had crossed the town and come at last to the alley behind the Kellys' house. Portia had entered first and then he followed. Highboy remained on the steps outside. Mick and her two little brothers were already in the kitchen. Portia told of William. Doctor Copeland did not listen to the words but her voice had a rhythm--a start, a middle, and an end. Then when she was finished she began all over. Others came into the room to hear.",0
6714,"Mick whispered to Portia, 'What's your father's name?'  'He named Benedict Mady Copeland.' Mick leaned over close to Doctor Copeland and shouted in his face as though he were deaf. 'Benedict, don't you think some hot coffee would make you feel a little better?'  Doctor Copeland started.",0
6715,"'Quit that hollering,' Portia said. 'He can hear well as you can.' 'Oh,' said Mick. She emptied the grounds from the pot and put the coffee on the stove to boil again.",0
6719,'Nothing us could do would make no difference. Best thing us can do is keep our mouth shut. ',0
6722,'With both feets sawed off that about all he can do.' The house was full of noise and unrest. In the room above the kitchen someone was moving furniture about. The dining-room was crowded with boarders. Mrs. Kelly hurried back and forth from the breakfast table to the kitchen. Mr. Kelly wandered about in a baggy pair of trousers and a bathrobe. The young Kelly children ate greedily in the kitchen. Doors banged and voices could be heard in all parts of the house.,0
6729,Portia held his shawl over the stove until the wool was hot. She buttoned his coat and turned up the collar about his neck. He cleared his throat and spat into one of the squares of paper that he carried with him in his pocket. Then he burned the paper in the stove. On the way out he stopped and spoke to Highboy on the steps. He suggested that Highboy stay with Portia if he could arrange to get leave from work.,0
6733,"'Doctor,' he said formally. 'You must be aware that I and all our colleagues and the members of my lodge and church--we have your sorrow uppermost in our minds and wish to extend to you our deepest sympathy. '",0
6736,"'What you want?'  'Will you please tell me where the judge's office is located?' The white man jerked his thumb toward the end of the passage. Doctor Copeland recognized him as a deputy sheriff. They had seen each other dozens of times but the deputy did not remember him. All white people looked similar to Negroes but Negroes took care to differentiate between them. On the other hand, all Negroes looked similar to white men but white men did not usually bother to fix the face of a Negro in their minds. So the white man said, 'What you want, Reverend?'",0
6740,"'Come here, you!' the deputy said finally. His head trembled, and when he arose he was not steady on his feet. 'Yes?'  'What you say you wanted to see the judge about?'  'I did not say,' said Doctor Copeland.",0
6743,"'That's the trouble with this country,' the sheriff said. 'These damn biggity niggers like him.' He spoke no word and let them do with him as they would. He waited for the terrible anger and felt it arise in him. Rage made him weak, so that he stumbled. They put him into the wagon with two men as guards. They took him to the station and then to the jail. It was only when they had entered the jail that the strength of his rage came to him. He broke loose suddenly from their grasp. In a corner he was surrounded. They struck him on the head and shoulders with their clubs. A glorious strength was in him and he heard himself laughing aloud as he fought. He sobbed and laughed at the same time. He kicked wildly with his feet. He fought with his fists and even struck at them with his head. Then he was clutched fast so that he could not move. They dragged him foot by foot through the hall of the jail. The door to a cell was opened. Someone behind kicked him in the groin and he fell to his knees on the floor.",0
6747,"The icy cell was permeated with a rotten odor. A pail brimming with urine was in a corner. Cockroaches crawled upon the walls. He closed his eyes and immediately he must have slept, for when he looked up again the small barred window was black and a bright light burned in the hall. Four empty tin plates were on the floor. His dinner of cabbage and cornbread was beside him.",0
6750,"The hours were long. The light in the hall burned his eyes and the odor in the cell made every breath a discomfort. He could not keep warm. His teeth chattered and he shook with a hard chill. He sat up with the dirty blanket wrapped around him and swayed to and fro. Twice he reached over to cover the white boy who muttered and threw out his arms in sleep. He swayed, his head in his hands, and from his throat there came a singing moan. He could not think of William. Nor could he even cogitate upon the strong, true purpose and draw strength from that. He could only feel the misery in him.",0
6752,* * * * *  The next morning the sun came out.,0
6766,Her Dad was in the kitchen with Portia. He had on his bathrobe and was drinking a cup of coffee. The whites of his eyes were red and his cup rattled against his saucer. He walked round and round the kitchen table.,0
6770,"'If there's a little extra milk I think I'll just have it poured over some crumbled bread,' her Dad said. 'Graveyard soup. Maybe that will help settle my stomach.'",0
6773,She was too full of energy to sit still. George had filled a meal sack with dirt and hung it to a limb of the tree for a punching bag. She began to hit this. Puck! Pock! She hit it in time to the song that had been in her mind when she woke up. George had mixed a sharp rock in the dirt and it bruised her knuckles.,0
6774,'Aoow! You skeeted the water right in my ear. It's busted my eardrum. I can't even hear. ',0
6775,"'Gimme here. Let me skeet some.'  Sprays of the water blew into her face, and once the kids turned the hose on her legs. She was afraid her box would get wet, so she carried it with her through the alley to the front porch. Harry was sitting on his steps reading the newspaper. She opened her box and got out the notebook. But it was hard to settle her mind on the song she wanted to write down. Harry was looking over in her direction and she could not think.",0
6781,'If you want to I can get bicycles and we can go tomorrow. I have a holiday one Sunday a month. ',0
6782,"'We'll ride out and take a picnic dinner,' Mick said. 'O.K. I'll borrow the bikes.' It was time for him to go to work. She watched him walk down the street. He swung his arms. Halfway down the block there was a bay tree with low branches. Harry took a running jump, caught a limb, and chinned himself. A happy feeling came in her because it was true they were real good friends. Also he was handsome. Tomorrow she would borrow Hazel's blue necklace and wear the silk dress. And for dinner they would take jelly sandwiches and Nehi. Maybe Harry would bring something queer, because they ate orthodox Jew. She watched him until he turned the corner. It was true that he had grown to be a very good-looking fellow.",0
6783,Harry in the country was different from Harry sitting on the back steps reading the newspapers and thinking about Hitler. They left early in the morning. The wheels he borrowed were the kind for boys--with a bar between the legs. They strapped the lunches and bathing-suits to the fenders and were gone before nine o'clock. The morning was hot and sunny. Within an hour they were far out of town on a red clay road. The fields were bright green and the sharp smell of pine trees was in the air. Harry talked in a very excited way. The warm wind blew into their faces. Her mouth was very dry and she was hungry.,0
6788,"'I bet we're at least ten miles from town. We've been riding an hour and a half--fast riding, too.' 'I sure am thirsty,' Mick said. 'And hungry. What you got in that sack for lunch?'  'Cold liver pudding and chicken salad sandwiches and pie.'",0
6792,"'What kind of drinks you got?' Harry asked. The storeman started to name them over. Mick opened the ice box and looked inside. Her hands felt good in the cold water. 'I want a chocolate Nehi. You got any of them?'  'Ditto,' Harry said.",0
6795,"'I like beer,' she said. 'I used to sop bread down in the drops our Dad left. I like to lick salt out my hand while I drink. This is the second bottle to myself I've ever had.'",0
6796,'The first swallow was sour. But the rest tastes good. ',0
6801,"The woods were very quiet. Slick pine needles covered the ground. Within a few minutes they had reached the creek. The water was brown and swift. Cool. There was no sound except from the water and a breeze singing high up in the pine trees. It was like the deep, quiet woods made them timid, and they walked softly along the bank beside the creek.",0
6802,'Don't it look pretty. ' Harry laughed. 'What makes you whisper? Listen here!' He clapped his hand over his mouth and gave a long Indian whoop that echoed back at them. 'Come on. Let's jump in the water and cool off. '  'Aren't you hungry?'  'O.K.,0
6803,Then we'll eat first. We'll eat half the lunch now and half later on when we come out.' She unwrapped the jelly sandwiches. When they were finished Harry balled the papers neatly and stuffed them into a hollow tree stump. Then he took his shorts and went down the path. She shucked off her clothes behind a bush and struggled into Hazel's bathing-suit. The suit was too small and cut her between the legs.,0
6805,"'I don't dive any more. I used to dive, high dive, all the time. But once I busted my head open, so I can't dive any more.' She thought a minute. 'It was a double jack-knife dive I was doing. And when I came up there was blood all in the water. But I didn't think anything about it and just began to do swimming tricks. These people were hollering at me. Then I found out where all this blood in the water was coming from. And I never have swam good since. '",0
6806,Harry scrambled up the bank. ' Gosh! I never heard about that. ',0
6808,"'The water's about ten feet deep except over on the other bank, and there it's shallow.' 'Less us get going. I bet that cold water feels good. '",0
6810,"'Watch here!' Harry shimmied up a tall, thin little tree. The trunk was limber and when he reached the top it swayed down with him. He dropped into the water.",0
6823,"'Now we can sleep and be fresh for the trip home.' They lay on the soft bed and looked up at the dark-green pine clumps against the sky. A bird sang a sad, clear song she had never heard before. One high note like an oboe--and then it sank down five tones and called again. The song was sad as a question without words.",0
6825,'I wish we was at the ocean. On the beach and watching the ships far out on the water. You went to the beach one summer--exactly what is it like?',0
6830,"Harry's head hung down and his shoulders were bent. Their shadows were long and black on the dusty road, for it was late afternoon. 'Listen here,' he said.",0
6835,"'It's this way,' he said. 'I never had even kissed a girl before. '",0
6839,"'No, I wasn't. I wasn't any kid. But now I wish I was, though.'",0
6841,'I never will marry either. I know that. And I'm not just saying so--it's true. ',0
6845,In a month or two I'll send you my address and you write and tell me for sure whether you're all right. ' 'How you mean?' she asked slowly.,0
6852,"His stepfather.' George grinned at Portia with his little square, blue teeth. 'His uncle, then.'",0
6857,Nobody noticed her. She ate a big plateful of cabbage and salmon and finished off with junket. It was her Mama she was thinking about. The door opened and her Mama came in and told Portia that Miss Brown had said she found a bedbug in her room. To get out the gasoline.,0
6862,"She stood by herself in the dark back yard, breaking off pieces of bark from the oak tree with her fingernails. It was almost worse this way. Maybe she would feel better if they could look at her and tell. If they knew.",0
6866,"[12] Now that the days were hot again the Sunny Dixie Show was always crowded. The March wind quieted. Trees were thick with their foliage of ocherous green. The sky was a cloudless blue and the rays of the sun grew stronger. The air was sultry. Jake Blount hated this weather. He thought dizzily of the long, burning summer months ahead. He did not feel well. Recently a headache had begun to trouble him constantly. He had gained weight so that his stomach developed a little pouch. He had to leave the top button of his trousers undone. He knew that this was alcoholic fat, but he kept on drinking. Liquor helped the ache in his head. He had only to take one small glass to make it better. Nowadays one glass was the same to him as a quart. It was not the liquor of the moment that gave him the kick--but the reaction of the first swallow to all the alcohol which had saturated his blood during these last months. A spoonful of beer would help the throbbing in his head, but a quart of whiskey could not make him drunk.",0
6870,"He met the writer of signs whose chalked message he had seen the past November. From the first day of their meeting the old man clung to him like an evil genius. His name was Simms and he preached on the sidewalks. The winter cold had kept him indoors, but in the spring he was out on the streets all day. His white hair was soft and ragged on his neck and he carried around with him a woman's big silk pocketbook full of chalk and Jesus ads. His eyes were bright and crazy. Simms tried to convert him.",0
6871,"'Child of adversity, I smell the sinful stink of beer on thy breath. And you smoke cigarettes. If the Lord had wanted us to smoke cigarettes He would have said so in His Book. The mark of Satan is on thy brow. I see it. Repent. Let me show you the light. '",0
6875,He took Simms down to a corner store for Coca-Colas and peanut butter crackers. Simms began to work on him again. When he left for the show Simms ran along behind him.,0
6878,"One night he was working on the machinery of the swings when suddenly he was roused from thought by the sounds of angry voices. Quickly he pushed through the crowd until he saw a white girl fighting with a colored girl by the ticket booth of the flying-jinny. He wrenched them apart, but still they struggled to get at each other. The crowd took sides and there was a bedlam of noise. The white girl was a hunchback. She held something tight in her hand.",0
6882,"'I seen Lurie drop her ticket and I watched this here white lady pick it up. That the truth,' a colored boy said. 'No nigger going to put her hands on no white girl while----'  'You quit that pushing me.",0
6884,"'This here the way it is,' said the colored girl. 'I bet I one of the few peoples here who done saved over fifty cents till Friday night. I done ironed double this week. I done paid a good nickel for that ticket she holding. And now I means to ride.'",0
6895,Afterward Jake treated the two men with angry contempt. Behind his back they jeered at him. One afternoon he found that the engine of the swings had been deliberately damaged and he had to work three hours overtime to fix it. Always he felt someone was laughing at him. Each time he heard the girls talking together he drew himself up straight and laughed carelessly aloud to himself as though thinking of some private joke.,0
6897,He caught the itch. He mixed some sulphur and hog fat and greased his body every morning. He clawed himself raw and it seemed that the itching would never be soothed. One night he broke loose. He had been sitting alone for many hours. He had mixed gin and whiskey and was very drunk. It was almost morning. He leaned out of the window and looked at the dark silent street. He thought of all the people around him. Sleeping. The don't-knows. Suddenly he bawled out in a loud voice: 'This is the truth! You bastards don't know anything. You don't know. You don't know!',0
6916,"[13] Jake and Singer waited on the front porch. When they pushed the doorbell there was no sound of a ring in the darkened house. Jake knocked impatiently and pressed his nose against the screen door. Beside him Singer stood wooden and smiling, with two spots of color on his cheeks, for they had drunk a bottle of gin together. The evening was quiet and dark. Jake watched a yellow light shaft softly through the hall. And Portia opened the door for them.",0
6917,'I certainly trust you not been waiting long. So many folks been coming that us thought it wise to untach the bell. You gentlemens just let me take you hats--Father been mighty sick. ',0
6918,"Jake tiptoed heavily behind Singer down the bare, narrow hall. At the threshold of the kitchen he stopped short. The room was crowded and hot. A fire burned in the small wood stove and the windows were closed tight. Smoke mingled with a certain Negro smell. The glow from the stove was the only light in the room. The dark voices he had heard back in the hall were silent.",0
6922,"'Good evening,' Jake said awkwardly. 'Your name Copeland?' The boy put his hands over the stumps of his legs and shrank back close to the wall. ' My name Willie.'",0
6926,"'I mean about how it all happened,' Jake said. Uneasily Willie looked up at his sister. 'I don't remember--very good. '",0
6929,"Jake said rudely. 'What in the name of Christ do you think you're in now?'  'Less us quiet down,' Portia said nervously. ' This here the way it is, Mr. Blount. They done let Willie off at the camp before his time were served. But they done also impressed it on him not to-- I believe you understand what us means. Naturally Willie he scared. Naturally us means to be careful--'cause that the best thing us can do. We already got enough trouble as is.'",0
6931,"'Why, the other two boys.'  'They n-not my friends,' Willie said. 'Us all has had a big falling out.' 'How you mean?'",0
6934,"'That ain't a good idea. And besides us was never very good friends anyway.' Willie felt the stumps of his legs with his dark, strong hands. 'I just wish I knowed where my f-f-feets are. That the main thing worries me. The doctor never given them back to me. I sure do wish I knowed where they are. '",0
6936,"'Where is Portia's father?' he asked. 'Doctor Copeland is in the front room, sir,' said Roberts.",0
6942,Jake stared at her dazedly. 'I don't know. ',0
6943,"Lancy glanced sullenly at Jake and pulled down the cuffs of his outgrown shirt. 'Give the Doctor my family's regards.'  'Us certainly do appreciate this,' Portia said. 'Father was speaking of you just the other day. He haves a book he wants to give you. Wait just one minute while I get it and rinch out this plate to return to your Mother. This were certainly a kindly thing for her to do.'",0
6946,"'A postman,' repeated John Roberts. 'With your permission----' Marshall Nicolls took a yellow silk handkerchief from his pocket and gingerly blew his nose. 'Naturally we have discussed this matter extensively. And without doubt as members of the colored race here in this free country of America we are anxious to do our part toward extending amicable relationships.'",0
6948,Jake turned from one to the other. 'I don't seem to follow you.' The heat was suffocating him. He wanted to get out. A film seemed to have settled over his eyeballs so that all the faces around him were blurred.,0
6957,"Marshall Nicolls and John Roberts exchanged a hurt look. Across the room Willie still sat playing music. His lips crawled over the square holes of the harmonica like fat, puckered caterpillars. His shoulders were broad and strong. The stumps of his thighs jerked in time to the music. Highboy danced while Buddy and Portia clapped out the rhythm.",0
6962,"He stood on the threshold of a small white room furnished only with an iron bed, a cabinet, and two chairs. On the bed lay the terrible Negro he had met on the stairs at Singer's house. His face was very black against the white, stiff pillows. The dark eyes were hot with hatred but the heavy, bluish lips were composed. His face was motionless as a black mask except for the slow, wide flutters of his nostrils with each breath.",0
6971,"'And the Negro,' said Doctor Copeland. 'To understand what is happening to us you have to----'  Jake interrupted him savagely. 'Who owns the South? Corporations in the North own three fourths of all the South. They say the old cow grazes all over--in the south, the west, the north, and the east. But she's milked in just one place. Her old teats swing over just one spot when she's full. She grazes everywhere and is milked in New York. Take our cotton mills, our pulp mills, our harness factories, our mattress factories. The North owns them. And what happens?' Jake's mustache quivered angrily. 'Here's an example. Locale, a mill village according to the great paternal system of American industry. Absentee ownership. In the village is one huge brick mill and maybe four or five hundred shanties. The houses aren't fit for human beings to live in. Moreover, the houses were built to be nothing but slums in the first place. These shanties are nothing but two or maybe three rooms and a privy--built with far less forethought than barns to house cattle. Built with far less attention to needs than sties for pigs. For under this system pigs are valuable and men are not. You can't make pork chops and sausage out of skinny little mill kids. You can't sell but half the people these days. But a pig----'  'Hold on!'",0
6977,"'That's the system,' Jake said. 'The Jew and the Negro,' said Doctor Copeland bitterly. 'The history of my people will be commensurate with the interminable history of the Jew--only bloodier and more violent. Like a certain species of sea gull. If you capture one of the birds and tie a red string of twine around his leg the rest of the flock will peck him to death. '",0
6980,"'Why, he couldn't have,' Jake insisted. 'He's pure Anglo-Saxon if I ever saw it. Irish and Anglo-Saxon.'",0
6999,"'But----'  'But, nothing,' said Doctor Copeland didactically. 'The most fatal thing a man can do is try to stand alone. '",0
7002,"'I have a program. It is a very simple, concentrated plan. I mean to focus on only one objective. In August of this year I plan to lead more than one thousand Negroes in this county on a march. A march to Washington. All of us together in one solid body. If you will look in the cabinet yonder you will see a stack of letters which I have written this week and will deliver personally.' Doctor Copeland slid his nervous hands up and down the sides of the narrow bed. 'You remember what I said to you a short while ago? You will recall that my only advice to you was: Do not attempt to stand alone. '",0
7009,'Pshaw! Double pshaw!' said Doctor Copeland furiously. 'I do not believe you have good sense. If I were a man who felt it worth my while to laugh I would surely laugh at that. Never have I had the opportunity to hear of such nonsense first hand. ',0
7020,"'Mister Singer, have you ever lived in a place where it snowed in the winter-time?' He tilted his chair back against the wall and nodded. 'In some different country than this one--in a foreign place?'",0
7028,"He brought home a dozen sheets of tin and some red paint. For the next week he was very busy. It seemed to him like this was a hell of a good idea. The signs were all over the floor of the front room. He got down on his hands and knees and took great care over the printing of each letter. As he worked he whistled and wagged his head. He hadn't been so cheerful and glad in months. Every now and then he would have to dress in his good suit and go around the corner for a glass of beer to calm himself. On the signs at first he had:  Wilbur Kelly Watch Repairing Very Cheap and Expert 'Mick, I want them to hit you right bang in the eye.",0
7030,"'You tried to write so much in the signs that nobody will read anything,' she told him. He brought home some more tin and left the designing up to her. She painted them very plain, with great big block letters and a picture of a clock. Soon he had a whole stack of them. A fellow he knew rode him out in the country where he could nail them to trees and fenceposts. At both ends of the block he put up a sign with a black hand pointing toward the house. And over the front door there was another sign.",0
7035,She knew the night-time again. But not the same as in the last summer when she walked in the dark by herself and listened to the music and made plans. She knew the night a different way now. In bed she lay awake. A queer afraidness came to her. It was like the ceiling was slowly pressing down toward her face. How would it be if the house fell apart? Once their Dad had said the whole place ought to be condemned. Did he mean that maybe some night when they were asleep the walls would crack and the house collapse? Bury them under all the plaster and broken glass and smashed furniture? So that they could not move or breathe? She lay awake and her muscles were stiff. In the night there was a creaking. Was that somebody walking--somebody else awake besides her--Mister Singer?  She never thought about Harry.,0
7036,She had made up her mind to forget him and she did forget him. He wrote that he had a job with a garage in Birmingham. She answered with a card saying 'O.K.' as they had planned. He sent his mother three dollars every week. It seemed like a very long time had passed since they went to the woods together.,0
7038,He made a sleepy answer. 'See the stars out the window. It's a hard thing to realize that every single one of those little stars is a planet as large as the earth.',0
7042,'It don't look a bit like one to me.' She took a drink from a glass of water on the floor. ' Less me and you play a game--the name game. You can be It if you want to. Whichever you like. You can choose.',0
7044,George sighed and his voice was tired. 'Are you Harpo Marx?'  'No. I'm not even in the movies. ',0
7045,'I don't know. ' 'Sure you do. My name begins with the letter M and I live in Italy. You ought to guess this. ',0
7047,The room was quiet and dark and George was asleep. She pinched him and twisted his ear. He groaned but did not awake. She fitted in close to him and pressed her face against his hot little naked shoulder. He would sleep all through the night while she was figuring with decimals.,0
7050,"In the mornings she and George would dress together and talk. Sometimes she wanted very much to be close to George. He had grown taller and was pale and peaked. His soft, reddish hair lay raggedy over the tops of his little ears. His sharp eyes were always squinted so that his face had a strained look. His permanent teeth were coming in, but they were blue and far apart like his baby teeth had been. Often his jaw was crooked because he had a habit of feeling out the sore new teeth with his tongue.",0
7057,"'Well, just take it for granted and pretend. ' 'I reckon I would like you all right. But I still say you can't prove----'  'Prove!",0
7059,'O.K. Then I don't like you none either.' He crawled down under the bed for something. 'What you want under there? You better leave my things alone. If ever I caught you meddling in my private box I'd bust your head against the side of the wall. I would. I'd stomp on your brains.',0
7060,"George came out from under the bed with his spelling book. His dirty little paw reached in a hole in the mattress where he hid his marbles. Nothing could faze that kid. He took his time about choosing three brown agates to take with him. 'Aw, shucks, Mick,' he answered her. George was too little and too tough. There wasn't any sense in loving him. He knew even less about things than she did.",0
7063,It was as though in some way she was waiting--but what she waited for she did not know. The sun burned down glaring and white-hot in the streets. During the day she either worked hard at music or messed with kids. And waited. Sometimes she would look all around her quick and this panic would come in her. Then in late June there was a sudden happening so important that it changed everything.,0
7064,"That night they were all out on the porch. The twilight was blurred and soft. Supper was almost ready and the smell of cabbage floated to them from the open hall. All of them were together except Hazel, who had not come home from work, and Etta, who still lay sick in bed. Their Dad leaned back in a chair with his sock-feet on the banisters. Bill was on the steps with the kids. Their Mama sat on the swing fanning herself with the newspaper. Across the street a girl new in the neighborhood skated up and down the sidewalk on one roller skate. The lights on the block were just beginning to be turned on, and far away a man was calling someone.",0
7071,Bill put Ralph down from his lap and shuffled his feet on the steps. 'Nobody ought to work until they're around sixteen. Mick should have two more years and finish at Vocational--if we can make it. ',0
7075,"'Ten dollars a week?'  'Sure,' Hazel said. 'Did you think it would be only ten a month?'  'Portia don't make but about that much. '",0
7077,"'It's not to be grinned at,' Bill said. 'That's what I make.' Mick's tongue was dry. She moved it around in her mouth to gather up spit enough to talk. Ten dollars a week would buy about fifteen fried chickens. Or five pairs of shoes or five dresses. Or installments on a radio.' She thought about a piano, but she did not mention that aloud.",0
7082,"'Sure,' Hazel said quickly. 'But tomorrow I'll go down with you and take the job if I can get it. '",0
7087,What do you think? Do you think it's a good idea? Do you think it's O.K. to drop out of school and work now? You think it's good?',0
7088,At first he did not understand. His gray eyes half-closed and he stood with his hands deep down in his pockets. There was the old feeling that they waited to tell each other things that had never been told before. The thing she had to say now was not much. But what he had to tell her would be right--and if he said the job sounded O.K. then she would feel better about it. She repeated the words slowly and waited.,0
7095,"Antonapoulos would be glad to see him. He would enjoy the fresh fruits and the presents. By now he would be out of the sick ward and able to go on an excursion to the movies, and afterward to the hotel where they had eaten dinner on the first visit. Singer had written many letters to Antonapoulos, but he had not posted them. He surrendered himself wholly to thoughts of his friend.",0
7097,"The summer evening came slowly. The sun sank down behind a ragged line of trees in the distance and the sky paled. The twilight was languid and soft. There was a white full moon, and low purple clouds lay over the horizon. The earth, the trees, the unpainted rural dwellings darkened slowly. At intervals mild summer lightning quivered in the air. Singer watched all of this intently until at last the night had come, and his own face was reflected in the glass before him.",0
7099,"Singer did not sleep. He pressed his face close against the glass and strained to see into the night. The darkness was heavy and velvety. Sometimes there was a patch of moonlight or the flicker of a lantern from the window of some house along the way. From the moon he saw that the train had turned from its southward course and was headed toward the east. The eagerness he felt was so keen that his nose was too pinched to breathe through and his cheeks were scarlet. He sat there, his face pressed close against the cold, sooty glass of the window, through most of the long night journey.",0
7103,"On the way back to the hotel he was careful not to crush the fruit he had brought with him. He took the packages up to his room and then wandered down to the lobby. Behind a potted palm tree there was a slot machine. He inserted a nickel but when he tried to pull the lever he found that the machine was jammed. Over this incident he made a great to-do. He cornered the clerk and furiously demonstrated what had happened. His face was deathly pale and he was so beside himself that tears rolled down the ridges of his nose. He flailed his hands and even stamped once with his long, narrow, elegantly shoed foot on the plush carpet. Nor was he satisfied when his coin was refunded, but insisted on checking out immediately. He packed his bag and was obliged to work energetically to make it close again. For in addition to the articles he had brought with him he carried away three towels, two cakes of soap, a pen and a bottle of ink, a roll of toilet paper, and a Holy Bible. He paid his bill and walked to the railway station to put his belongings in custody. The train did not leave until nine in the evening and he had the empty afternoon before him.",0
7109,"Singer left his luggage in the middle of the station floor. Then he walked to the shop. He greeted the jeweler for whom he worked with a listless turn of his hand. When he went out again there was something heavy in his pocket. For a while he rambled with bent head along the streets. But the unrefracted brilliance of the sun, the humid heat, oppressed him. He returned to his room with swollen eyes and an aching head. After resting he drank a glass of iced coffee and smoked a cigarette. Then when he had washed the ash tray and the glass he brought out a pistol from his pocket and put a bullet in his chest.",0
7115,"He had first come into the house with her whom he loved. And Daisy was dressed in her bridal gown and wore a white lace veil. Her skin was the beautiful color of dark honey and her laughter was sweet. At night he had shut himself in the bright room to study alone. He had tried to cogitate and to discipline himself to study. But with Daisy near him there was a strong desire in him that would not go away with study. So sometimes he surrendered to these feelings, and again he bit his lips and meditated with the books throughout the night. And then there were Hamilton and Karl Marx and William and Portia. All lost. No one remained.",0
7122,Portia said angrily. 'You done grumbled so much that I nearly worn out. You done fumed and fussed so that I right shamed for you.',0
7123,'Pshaw! Say what you will. You only come before me like a gnat. I know what I wish and will not be pestered into doing that which is wrong. ',0
7125,"'No, I will not,' said Doctor Copeland. ' But I would have recovered here. I know it. '",0
7127,"'I have always managed, and I can manage yet.' 'You just trying to be contrary. '",0
7131,"'I wish so, too.' 'How come you so determined to grieve?'  'I just feel that I have failed,' he said. 'How you mean you done failed?'",0
7133,'O.K. But us got to get gone from here pretty soon. ',0
7138,"'Daughter,' he said. 'Get me my watch and coat. I am going.'",0
7143,'I do not have any home. So why should I be homesick?' Portia wet her lips nervously and said: 'He coming back whenever he get good and ready. Buddy will be glad to ride him to town in the car. Buddy just love to drive. ',0
7147,"'Father, suppose you set on Highboy's lap. I believe you be more comfortable than scrouged up here with us and all this furniture. '",0
7155,"The motion of the wagon jolted his back. He looked up at the branches overhead, and then when there was no shade he covered his face with a handkerchief to shield his eyes from the sun. It was not possible that this could be the end. Always he had felt in him the strong, true purpose. For forty years his mission was his life and his life was his mission. And yet all remained to be done and nothing was completed.",0
7158,Doctor Copeland said bitterly. 'I believe in justice now. ',0
7162,"[2] Afternoon   Jake ran at a violent, clumsy pace. He went through Weavers Lane and then cut into a side alley, climbed a fence, and hastened onward. Nausea rose in his belly so that there was the taste of vomit in his throat. A barking dog chased beside him until he stopped long enough to threaten it with a rock. His eyes were wide with horror and he held his hand clapped to his open mouth.",0
7163,"Christ! So this was the finish. A brawl. A riot. A fight with every man for himself. Bloody heads and eyes cut with broken bottles. Christ! And the wheezy music of the flying-jinny above the noise. The dropped hamburgers and cotton candy and the screaming younguns. And him in it all. Fighting blind with the dust and sun. The sharp cut of teeth against his knuckles. And laughing. Christ! And the feeling that he had let loose a wild, hard rhythm in him that wouldn't stop. And then looking close into the dead black face and not knowing. Not even knowing if he had killed or not. But wait. Christ! Nobody could have stopped it.",0
7172,"A wall, a flight of stairs, a road ahead. The burning sun was like a heavy weight on him. He started back the way he had come. This time he walked slowly, wiping his wet face with the greasy sleeve of his shirt. He could not stop the trembling of his lips and he bit them until he tasted blood.",0
7174,"He Died to Save You   Hear the Story of His Love and Grace Every Nite 7.15 P.M. The street was empty. Jake tried to cross over to the other sidewalk, but Simms caught him by the arm.",0
7177,You be here on time to hear His Word.' Jake licked his mustache. 'You have such a crowd every night I can't get up close enough to hear.',0
7182,the old man screamed. 'Child of Sodom! God will remember this.',0
7183,"Jake crossed over to the other sidewalk and started toward the house where he lived. ' So long, Brother.'  'Sinner,' the old man called.",0
7185,"Singer was dead. And the way he had felt when he first heard that he had killed himself was not sad--it was angry. He was before a wall. He remembered all the innermost thoughts that he had told to Singer, and with his death it seemed to him that they were lost. And why had Singer wanted to end his life? Maybe he had gone insane. But anyway he was dead, dead, dead. He could not be seen or touched or spoken to, and the room where they had spent so many hours had been rented to a girl who worked as a typist. He could go there no longer. He was alone. A wall, a flight of stairs, an open road.",0
7187,"For a month he had worked on these papers, scribbling them during working hours, typing and making carbons on the typewriter at the New York Café, distributing them by hand. He had worked day and night. But who read them? What good had any of it done? A town this size was too big for any one man. And now he was leaving.",0
7196,"' Nothing you would understand.' 'Us colored peoples have feelings just like anybody else. And I stand by what I said, Mr. Blount. Father just a sick old colored man and he had enough trouble already. Us got to look after him. And he not anxious to see you--I know that. '",0
7202,"'But your lips are turning blue. You look all knocked up.' 'I'm all right. What I want is some supper. '  'Supper won't be ready for half an hour,' Brannon said patiently.",0
7203,'Any old leftovers will do. Just put them on a plate. You don't even have to bother to heat them. ',0
7205,'Here you are.' Brannon said. 'This ought to help out.',0
7207,"It's a good drink.' 'How much do I owe you?' 'I don't know offhand, but I'll figure it out before you leave. '",0
7215,"I'm getting out of here this afternoon. ' Brannon polished his nails on the palm of his hand. 'Well, of course it's not necessary--but it might be a good thing. Why so headlong? No sense in starting out this time of day. '",0
7216,"'I just rather.'  'I do think it behooves you to make a new start. At the same time why don't you take my advice on this? Myself--I'm a conservative and of course I think your opinions are radical. But at the same time I like to know all sides of a matter. Anyway, I want to see you straighten out. So why don't you go some place where you can meet a few people more or less like yourself? And then settle down?'",0
7222,The dream was still heavy in his mind. He felt the old terror that always came as he awakened. He pushed Brannon away and stood up. 'You don't have to tell me I had a nightmare. I remember just how it was. And I've had the same dream for about fifteen times before. ',0
7224,'What was it?' Brannon asked. 'Was the devil chasing you?',0
7225,Jake stood up and went to the mirror behind the counter. His face was dirty and sweaty. There were dark circles beneath his eyes. He wet his handkerchief under the fountain faucet and wiped off his face. Then he took out a pocket comb and neatly combed his mustache.,0
7229,'Just dripping off the awning. I rather get out of town before dark. ',0
7231,I been broke before. ' Brannon had an envelope ready and in it were two twenty-dollar bills. Jake looked at them on both sides and put them in his pocket. 'God knows why you do it. You'll never smell them again. But thanks. I won't forget.',0
7233,"The door closed behind him. When he looked back at the end of the block, Brannon was watching from the sidewalk. He walked until he reached the railroad tracks. On either side there were rows of dilapidated two-room houses. In the cramped back yards were rotted privies and lines of torn, smoky rags hung out to dry. For two miles there was not one sight of comfort or space or cleanliness. Even the earth itself seemed filthy and abandoned. Now and then there were signs that a vegetable row had been attempted, but only a few withered collards had survived. And a few fruitless, smutty fig trees. Little younguns swarmed in this filth, the smaller of them stark naked. The sight of this poverty was so cruel and hopeless that Jake snarled and clenched his fists.",0
7236,"The heavy rain had left the sky a pale, quiet blue. Dark was coming. Already the lights were turned on. Automobile horns honked in the street and the newsboys hollered out the headlines in the papers. She didn't want to go home. If she went home now she would lie down on the bed and bawl. That was how tired she was. But if she went into the New York Café and ate some ice cream she might feel O.K. And smoke and be by herself a little while.",0
7239,"He put down a menu and pointed with his little finger that wore a lady's gold ring. 'See--here's some nice roast chicken or some veal stew. Why don't you have a little supper with me?'  'No, thanks.",0
7243,She oughtn't to have come in here. The bottoms of her shoes were clean worn out. She ought to have saved the twenty cents toward a new half-sole. Because if she kept on standing on a shoe with a hole in it what would happen? A blister would come on her foot. And she would have to pick it with a burnt needle. She would have to stay home from work and be fired. And then what would happen?,0
7244,"'Here you are,' said Mister Brannon. ' But I never heard of such a combination before. '",0
7245,"He put the sundae and the beer on the table. She pretended to clean her fingernails because if she noticed him he would start talking. He didn't have this grudge against her any more, so he must have forgotten about the pack of gum. Now he always wanted to talk to her. But she wanted to be quiet and by herself. The sundae was O.K., covered all over with chocolate and nuts and cherries. And the beer was relaxing. The beer had a nice bitter taste after the ice cream and it made her drunk. Next to music beer was best.",0
7249,But maybe it would be true about the piano and turn out O.K. Maybe she would get a chance soon. Else what the hell good had it all been--the way she felt about music and the plans she had made in the inside room? It had to be some good if anything made sense. And it was too and it was too and it was too and it was too. It was some good.,0
7250,"All right!  O.K.! Some good. [4] Night   All was serene. As Biff dried his face and hands a breeze tinkled the glass pendants of the little Japanese pagoda on the table. He had just awaked from a nap and had smoked his night cigar. He thought of Blount and wondered if by now he had traveled far. A bottle of Agua Florida was on the bathroom shelf and he touched the stopper to his temples. He whistled an old song, and as he descended the narrow stairs the tune left a broken echo behind him.",0
7258,"He examined the zinnia he had intended to save. As he held it in the palm of his hand to the light the flower was not such a curious specimen after all. Not worth saving. He plucked the soft, bright petals and the last one came out on love. But who? Who would he be loving now? No one person. Anybody decent who came in out of the street to sit for an hour and have a drink. But no one person. He had known his loves and they were over. Alice, Madeline and Gyp. Finished. Leaving him either better or worse. Which? However you looked at it.",0
7260,"Biff tapped his nose with his forefinger. A foreign voice was now speaking on the radio. He could not decide for certain whether the voice was German, French, or Spanish. But it sounded like doom. It gave him the jitters to listen to it. When he turned it off the silence was deep and unbroken. He felt the night outside. Loneliness gripped him so that his breath quickened. It was far too late to call Lucile on the telephone and speak to Baby. Nor could he expect a customer to enter at this hour. He went to the door and looked up and down the street. All was empty and dark.",0
7261,"'Louis!' he called. 'Are you awake, Louis?'",0
7262,No answer. He put his elbows on the counter and held his head in his hands. He moved his dark bearded jaw from side to side and slowly his forehead lowered in a frown.,0
7264,"He had managed about the funeral. They had left all that to him. Singer's affairs were in a mess. There were installments due on everything he owed and the beneficiary of his life insurance was deceased. There was just enough to bury him. The funeral was at noon. The sun burned down on them with savage heat as they stood around the open dank grave. The flowers curled and turned brown in the sun. Mick cried so hard that she choked herself and her father had to beat her on the back. Blount scowled down at the grave with his fist to his mouth. The town's colored doctor, who was somehow related to poor Willie, stood on the edge of the crowd and moaned to himself. And there were strangers nobody had ever seen or heard of before. God knows where they came from or why they were there.",0
7275,"It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.",0
7279,"Why they came East I don’t know. They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.",0
7280,"And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.",0
7284,"“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. “We’ll go inside.”",0
7285,"We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.",0
7290,"I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.",0
7294,"“Well, you ought to see her. She’s—”  Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder. “What you doing, Nick?”  “I’m a bond man.”",0
7296,"“You will,” I answered shortly. “You will if you stay in the East.” “Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. “I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”",0
7297,"At this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that I started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.",0
7301,"“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “I know somebody there.” “I don’t know a single—”  “You must know Gatsby.”  “Gatsby?” demanded Daisy.",0
7310,"“He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we—”  “Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.”",0
7314,"For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk. The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.",0
7315,"“I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation: “An absolute rose?”",0
7322,"“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety. She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s singing away—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”  “Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”",0
7325,"Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl. “We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly. “Even if we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.”",0
7330,"“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a convinced way. “Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I know. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.” Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated—God, I’m sophisticated!”",0
7333,"When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand. “To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in our very next issue.” Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.",0
7341,"demanded Tom suddenly. “Did I?” She looked at me. “I can’t seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know—”  “Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.",0
7344,"“It’s a libel. I’m too poor.” “But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way. “We heard it from three people, so it must be true.”",0
7346,"Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.",0
7353,"I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg’s persistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a garage—Repairs. George B. Wilson. Cars bought and sold.—and I followed Tom inside.",0
7355,"“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping him jovially on the shoulder. “How’s business?”  “I can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvincingly. “When are you going to sell me that car?”  “Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.”  “Works pretty slow, don’t he?”  “No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly.",0
7359,"“I’ll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level.” She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door. We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.",0
7369,"“That dog? That dog’s a boy.” “It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. “Here’s your money. Go and buy ten more dogs with it.”",0
7376,"Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment door. The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.",0
7379,"“My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, “most of these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me the bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out.”",0
7382,"“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,” pursued Mrs. McKee. “If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.” We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.",0
7384,"“I wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried Mrs. McKee. “I think it’s—”  Her husband said “Sh!” and we all looked at the subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.",0
7386,"She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there. “I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,” asserted Mr. McKee.",0
7389,I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby’s. Do you know him?”  “I live next door to him.”,0
7391,"This absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs. McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:  “Chester, I think you could do something with her,” she broke out, but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom. “I’d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry. All I ask is that they should give me a start.”  “Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray.",0
7404,"“She really ought to get away from him,” resumed Catherine to me. “They’ve been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom’s the first sweetie she ever had.”",0
7406,"Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom. “It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subway train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live forever; you can’t live forever.’ ”  She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter.",0
7409,"The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to mention Daisy’s name.",0
7414,"Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler’s thumb. At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.",0
7417,"Suddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray’s understudy from the Follies. The party has begun.",0
7420,"I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key.",0
7422,"“Hello!” I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.",0
7424,"That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week before. “You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but we met you here about a month ago.”",0
7427,"“I like to come,” Lucille said. “I never care what I do, so I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.”",0
7432,"One of the men nodded in confirmation. “I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany,” he assured us positively. “Oh, no,” said the first girl, “it couldn’t be that, because he was in the American army during the war.” As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. “You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody’s looking at him. I’ll bet he killed a man.”",0
7436,"The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not there. She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.",0
7448,"We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning. “Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.”  “What time?”  “Any time that suits you best.”",0
7449,"It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled. “Having a gay time now?” she inquired. “Much better.” I turned again to my new acquaintance. “This is an unusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the host. I live over there—” I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.”",0
7451,"“I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.” He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.",0
7452,"Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn. “If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,” he urged me. “Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.”",0
7453,When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years. “Who is he?” I demanded. “Do you know?”  “He’s just a man named Gatsby.”,0
7454,"“Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?”  “Now you’re started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile. “Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man.”",0
7457,"“Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete. “And I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”",0
7460,"“I beg your pardon.” Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us. “Miss Baker?” he inquired. “I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.”",0
7464,"“She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,” explained a girl at my elbow. I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan’s party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed: “You promised!” into his ear.",0
7475,"The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s library. “How’d it happen?”  He shrugged his shoulders. “I know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he said decisively.",0
7477,"“Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.”  “But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly, “I wasn’t even trying.” An awed hush fell upon the bystanders. “Do you want to commit suicide?”  “You’re lucky it was just a wheel!",0
7480,"Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster. “Wha’s matter?” he inquired calmly. “Did we run outa gas?”  “Look!”  Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.",0
7483,"“But the wheel’s off!” He hesitated. “No harm in trying,” he said.",0
7493,"“Well, other people are,” she said lightly. “What’s that got to do with it?”  “They’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “It takes two to make an accident.”",0
7501,"A man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as “the boarder”—I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Myer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.",0
7502,"Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have forgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to be.",0
7512,“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually. “San Francisco.”  “I see.” “My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.”,0
7513,"His voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise. “After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.”",0
7518,"It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby, looking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand. Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.",0
7524,"“Right you are,” agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. “Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!”",0
7527,"“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought; “anything at all…”  Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder. Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby for lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.",0
7531,"“Highballs?” asked the head waiter. “This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. “But I like across the street better!”",0
7537,"The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for me:  “Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man.”  “No?” Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.",0
7539,"A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table.",0
7540,"“Look here, old sport,” said Gatsby, leaning toward me, “I’m afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car.” There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it. “I don’t like mysteries,” I answered, “and I don’t understand why you won’t come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?”  “Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me.",0
7543,"“It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.”  “Have you known Gatsby for a long time?” I inquired. “Several years,” he answered in a gratified way. “I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister.’ ” He paused. “I see you’re looking at my cuff buttons.”",0
7548,"“You’re very polite, but I belong to another generation,” he announced solemnly. “You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your—” He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand. “As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won’t impose myself on you any longer.”",0
7554,"“Come along with me for a minute,” I said; “I’ve got to say hello to someone.” When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction. “Where’ve you been?” he demanded eagerly. “Daisy’s furious because you haven’t called up.”  “This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”",0
7568,"Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years. It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said: “What Gatsby?” and when I described him—I was half asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know. It wasn’t until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car.",0
7569,"When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park. The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties, and the clear voices of children, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:  “I’m the Sheik of Araby. Your love belongs to me. At night when you’re asleep Into your tent I’ll creep—”  “It was a strange coincidence,” I said.",0
7574,"“Oh!”  “I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night,” went on Jordan, “but she never did. Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately suggested a luncheon in New York—and I thought he’d go mad:  “ ‘I don’t want to do anything out of the way!’",0
7581,"“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said. “Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently. “I have been glancing into some of the rooms. Let’s go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.”  “It’s too late.”  “Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool?",0
7587,"“There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated. “Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I asked.",0
7599,Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop. “Will they do?” I asked.,0
7601,"The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay’s Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor, and peering towards the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me, in an uncertain voice, that he was going home.",0
7609,"For half a minute there wasn’t a sound. Then from the living-room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note:  “I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.” A pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall, so I went into the room.",0
7612,"“It’s an old clock,” I told them idiotically. I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor. “We haven’t met for many years,” said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be.",0
7616,"He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and whispered: “Oh, God!” in a miserable way. “What’s the matter?”  “This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his head from side to side, “a terrible, terrible mistake.”",0
7623,"“I’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy. “I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,” he said, “I’d like to show her around.”",0
7625,"I agreed that it was splendid. “Yes.” His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. “It took me just three years to earn the money that bought it.”",0
7629,"“I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people.”",0
7630,"Instead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the road and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees.",0
7631,"And inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and Restoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton College Library” I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter. We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It was Mr. Klipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby’s own apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam’s study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.",0
7636,"He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-coloured disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.",0
7639,"I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk. “Who’s this?”  “That?",0
7640,"That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.” The name sounded faintly familiar. “He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.”",0
7646,"“Did we interrupt your exercise?” inquired Daisy politely. “I was asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment. “That is, I’d been asleep. Then I got up…”  “Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby, cutting him off.",0
7647,"“Don’t you, Ewing, old sport?”  “I don’t play well. I don’t—hardly play at all. I’m all out of prac—”  “We’ll go downstairs,” interrupted Gatsby.",0
7650,"“Play!”  “In the morning, In the evening, Ain’t we got fun—”  Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on the air.",0
7652,"As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn’t be over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song.",0
7654,VI About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsby’s door and asked him if he had anything to say. “Anything to say about what?” inquired Gatsby politely. “Why—any statement to give out.”,0
7661,"Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money. The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgid journalism in 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny in Little Girl Bay.",0
7666,"He told me all this very much later, but I’ve put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents, which weren’t even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away.",0
7669,"As though they cared!  “Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.” He walked around the room quickly, ringing bells. “I’ll have something to drink for you in just a minute.”",0
7671,"“I suppose the automobiles—”  “Yeah.”  Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had accepted the introduction as a stranger. “I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.” “Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering. “So we did. I remember very well.”  “About two weeks ago.”",0
7676,"“You come to supper with me,” said the lady enthusiastically. “Both of you.” This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.",0
7677,"“Come along,” he said—but to her only. “I mean it,” she insisted. “I’d love to have you. Lots of room.”",0
7678,"Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn’t see that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t. “I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.",0
7685,"They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat. “These things excite me so,” she whispered. “If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card. I’m giving out green—”  “Look around,” suggested Gatsby.",0
7686,“I’m looking around. I’m having a marvellous—”  “You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about.” Tom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.,0
7688,"“She’s lovely,” said Daisy. “The man bending over her is her director.” He took them ceremoniously from group to group:  “Mrs. Buchanan… and Mr. Buchanan—” After an instant’s hesitation he added: “the polo player.”",0
7699,"“I like her,” said Daisy, “I think she’s lovely.” But the rest offended her—and inarguably because it wasn’t a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented “place” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village—appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a shortcut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand.",0
7703,"He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet. “Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together.”",0
7706,"When the melody rose her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air. “Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she said suddenly. “That girl hadn’t been invited. They simply force their way in and he’s too polite to object.”  “I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom.",0
7719,"Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever.",0
7722,"“Carraway.”  “Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.” Abruptly he slammed the door.",0
7726,So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes. “They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for. They’re all brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.”,0
7736,"Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone. Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.",0
7739,"Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room. “Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike. “I’m glad to see you, sir… Nick…”  “Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.",0
7746,"“Yes,” admitted the child calmly. “Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress too.” “How do you like mother’s friends?” Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby. “Do you think they’re pretty?”  “Where’s Daddy?”  “She doesn’t look like her father,” explained Daisy.",0
7749,"We drank in long, greedy swallows. “I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,” said Tom genially. “It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into the sun—or wait a minute—it’s just the opposite—the sun’s getting colder every year.",0
7750,"“Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d like you to have a look at the place.” I went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.",0
7755,"Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table. “You always look so cool,” she repeated.",0
7760,"“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him. “It’s too hot to fuss.” He didn’t answer.",0
7763,"“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely. “Women get these notions in their heads—”  “Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window. “I’ll get some whisky,” answered Tom. He went inside.",0
7766,"“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green leather of the seat. “I ought to have left it in the shade.”  “Is it standard shift?”",0
7773,"The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from the edge of theoretical abyss. “I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,” he continued. “I could have gone deeper if I’d known—”  “Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?” inquired Jordan humorously.",0
7775,"“And you found he was an Oxford man,” said Jordan helpfully. “An Oxford man!” He was incredulous. “Like hell he is! He wears a pink suit.”",0
7776,"“Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man.”  “Oxford, New Mexico,” snorted Tom contemptuously, “or something like that.” “Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?” demanded Jordan crossly.",0
7779,"Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilson’s sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car. “Let’s have some gas!” cried Tom roughly. “What do you think we stopped for—to admire the view?”  “I’m sick,” said Wilson without moving.",0
7780,"“Been sick all day.”  “What’s the matter?”  “I’m all run down.” “Well, shall I help myself?” Tom demanded. “You sounded well enough on the phone.”",0
7781,"With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face was green. “I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said. “But I need money pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car.”",0
7782,"“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom. “I bought it last week.” “It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.",0
7790,"There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easygoing blue coupé.",0
7793,"“How about the movies?”  “It’s so hot,” she complained. “You go. We’ll ride around and meet you after.” With an effort her wit rose faintly. “We’ll meet you on some corner. I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.”",0
7794,"“We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us. “You follow me to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza.” Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of his life forever.",0
7799,"There was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse me”—but this time no one laughed. “I’ll pick it up,” I offered.",0
7806,"The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of “Yea—ea—ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began. “We’re getting old,” said Daisy. “If we were young we’d rise and dance.”  “Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her.",0
7811,"“Biloxi?”  “First place, we didn’t have any president—”  Gatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly. “By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.” “Not exactly.”",0
7813,Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closing of the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.,0
7817,"“Open the whisky, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep. Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself… Look at the mint!” “Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.”",0
7819,"repeated Tom incredulously. “I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out… Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white.”",0
7828,"“I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby. “Going on for five years—and you didn’t know.”  Tom turned to Daisy sharply. “You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”  “Not seeing,” said Gatsby.",0
7832,"She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do you know why we left Chicago? I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you to the story of that little spree.” Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.",0
7833,"“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly. “It doesn’t matter any more. Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it’s all wiped out forever.”",0
7835,"“I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance. “Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly. “No.”  From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air.",0
7838,"Gatsby’s eyes opened and closed. “You loved me too?” he repeated. “Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely. “She didn’t know you were alive. Why—there’s things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.”",0
7853,“Go on. He won’t annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over.”,0
7854,"They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity. After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of whisky in the towel. “Want any of this stuff? Jordan?… Nick?”  I didn’t answer.",0
7858,"“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly. “She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we’re going to move away.” Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road. When anyone spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colourless way. He was his wife’s man and not his own.",0
7864,"He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes. “We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.” I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” uttered over and over in a gasping moan.",0
7867,"“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!”  Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around the garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman.",0
7870,"“There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see?”  “Going where?” asked the policeman keenly. “One goin’ each way. Well, she”—his hand rose toward the blankets but stopped halfway and fell to his side—“she ran out there an’ the one comin’ from N’York knock right into her, goin’ thirty or forty miles an hour.”",0
7872,"“It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car. New.”  “See the accident?” asked the policeman.",0
7880,"Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down hard, and the coupé raced along through the night. In a little while I heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face. “The God damned coward!” he whimpered. “He didn’t even stop his car.”",0
7884,But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi. I’ll wait outside.” Jordan put her hand on my arm.,0
7887,"I hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon. “What are you doing?” I inquired.",0
7891,"He spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered. “I got to West Egg by a side road,” he went on, “and left the car in my garage. I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course I can’t be sure.”",0
7892,"I disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to tell him he was wrong. “Who was the woman?” he inquired. “Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen?”  “Well, I tried to swing the wheel—” He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.",0
7894,"“It ripped her open—”  “Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced. “Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.",0
7897,"“How long are you going to wait?”  “All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.” A new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it—he might think anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the ground floor.",0
7908,"But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand.",0
7910,"But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be. She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing. He felt married to her, that was all.",0
7912,"“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she didn’t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her… Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn’t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?”  On the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time.",0
7913,"It was a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.",0
7915,"For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the “Beale Street Blues” while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.",0
7916,"Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at hand.",0
7918,"It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning, gold-turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.",0
7920,"He sat down gloomily. “Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were first married—and loved me more even then, do you see?”  Suddenly he came out with a curious remark. “In any case,” he said, “it was just personal.”",0
7931,"I thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for that—I and the others. “Goodbye,” I called. “I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.”",0
7938,"They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must have broken her rule against drinking that night, for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of this, she immediately fainted, as if that was the intolerable part of the affair. Someone, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sister’s body.",0
7939,"Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside. For a while the door of the office was open, and everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it. Finally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door. Michaelis and several other men were with him; first, four or five men, later two or three men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer, while he went back to his own place and made a pot of coffee. After that, he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn.",0
7943,"He didn’t like to go into the garage, because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortably around the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet. “Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you haven’t been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?”  “Don’t belong to any.”",0
7947,"“This?” he inquired, holding it up. Wilson stared and nodded. “I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but I knew it was something funny.”",0
7948,"“You mean your wife bought it?”  “She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.” Michaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash. But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began saying “Oh, my God!” again in a whisper—his comforter left several explanations in the air.",0
7950,"“You’re morbid, George,” said his friend. “This has been a strain to you and you don’t know what you’re saying. You’d better try and sit quiet till morning.”",0
7958,"His movements—he was on foot all the time—were afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich that he didn’t eat, and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and walking slowly, for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon. Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who had seen a man “acting sort of crazy,” and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared from view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he “had a way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car. On the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the way to Gatsby’s house. So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.",0
7964,"Most of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial, eager, and untrue. When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might have said anything, didn’t say a word. She showed a surprising amount of character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man “deranged by grief” in order that the case might remain in its simplest form. And it rested there.",0
7966,"I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them. “Left no address?”  “No.”  “Say when they’d be back?”  “No.”  “Any idea where they are?",0
7969,"“Sorry. I’m afraid no one’s there.” I went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with shocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:  “Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me.",0
7970,"You’ve got to try hard. I can’t go through this alone.” Someone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he’d never told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence, staring down from the wall.",0
7982,"“Well, I’m all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?”  I took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there. Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall; when I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly away.",0
7985,"He shook his head. “Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in the East. Were you a friend of my boy’s, Mr.—?”  “We were close friends.”",0
7991,"“The funeral’s tomorrow,” I said. “Three o’clock, here at the house. I wish you’d tell anybody who’d be interested.”",0
7992,"“Oh, I will,” he broke out hastily. “Of course I’m not likely to see anybody, but if I do.” His tone made me suspicious.",0
7994,"“How about saying you’ll come?”  “Well, the fact is—the truth of the matter is that I’m staying with some people up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect me to be with them tomorrow. In fact, there’s a sort of picnic or something. Of course I’ll do my best to get away.”",0
8004,"“Oh.”  “I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right away he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like that in everything”—he held up two bulbous fingers—“always together.”",0
8005,"I wondered if this partnership had included the World’s Series transaction in 1919. “Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment. “You were his closest friend, so I know you’ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.”  “I’d like to come.”",0
8006,"“Well, come then.” The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears. “I can’t do it—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he said.",0
8013,“Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very pretty picture. It shows up well.”,0
8015,"He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong Cassidy. “Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows you.”",0
8019,"He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own use. A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing, and I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did Gatsby’s father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously, and he spoke of the rain in a worried, uncertain way. The minister glanced several times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour. But it wasn’t any use. Nobody came.",0
8023,"“I couldn’t get to the house,” he remarked. “Neither could anybody else.”  “Go on!” He started. “Why, my God! they used to go there by the hundreds.”",0
8028,"She was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the colour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that, though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’t making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye.",0
8034,"“You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly. “Crazy as hell. I don’t know what’s the matter with you.”",0
8036,"There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn’t true. “And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering—look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful—”  I couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified.",0
8038,"Gatsby’s house was still empty when I left—the grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own. I didn’t want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train.",0
8048,"By that time, though, he had other things to worry about. He had been taken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine. She was very forceful, and Cohn never had a chance of not being taken in hand. Also he was sure that he loved her. When this lady saw that the magazine was not going to rise, she became a little disgusted with Cohn and decided that she might as well get what there was to get while there was still something available, so she urged that they go to Europe, where Cohn could write. They came to Europe, where the lady had been educated, and stayed three years. During these three years, the first spent in travel, the last two in Paris, Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks and myself. Braddocks was his literary friend. I was his tennis friend.",0
8052,"I was kicked again under the table and, looking, saw Frances, Robert’s lady, her chin lifting and her face hardening. “Hell,” I said, “why go to Strasbourg? We could go up to Bruges, or to the Ardennes.”",0
8054,"If I know an American girl that lives in Strasbourg what the hell is it to Frances?”  “It doesn’t make any difference. Any girl. I couldn’t go, that would be all.”  “Don’t be silly.”",0
8059,"CHAPTER 2 That winter Robert Cohn went over to America with his novel, and it was accepted by a fairly good publisher. His going made an awful row I heard, and I think that was where Frances lost him, because several women were nice to him in New York, and when he came back he was quite changed. He was more enthusiastic about America than ever, and he was not so simple, and he was not so nice. The publishers had praised his novel pretty highly and it rather went to his head. Then several women had put themselves out to be nice to him, and his horizons had all shifted. For four years his horizon had been absolutely limited to his wife. For three years, or almost three years, he had never seen beyond Frances. I am sure he had never been in love in his life.",0
8072,“That’s because you never read a book about it. Go on and read a book all full of love affairs with the beautiful shiny black princesses.” “I want to go to South America.”,0
8075,"“Do you know that in about thirty-five years more we’ll be dead?”  “What the hell, Robert,” I said. “What the hell.”  “I’m serious.” “It’s one thing I don’t worry about,” I said.",0
8080,"So there you were. I was sorry for him, but it was not a thing you could do anything about, because right away you ran up against the two stubbornnesses: South America could fix it and he did not like Paris. He got the first idea out of a book, and I suppose the second came out of a book too.",0
8081,"“Well,” I said, “I’ve got to go up-stairs and get off some cables.” “Do you really have to go?”  “Yes, I’ve got to get these cables off.” “Do you mind if I come up and sit around the office?”  “No, come on up.”",0
8091,"“Well,” I said, “are you going to buy me a dinner?”  She grinned and I saw why she made a point of not laughing. With her mouth closed she was a rather pretty girl. I paid for the saucers and we walked out to the street. I hailed a horse-cab and the driver pulled up at the curb. Settled back in the slow, smoothly rolling fiacre we moved up the Avenue de l’Opéra, passed the locked doors of the shops, their windows lighted, the Avenue broad and shiny and almost deserted. The cab passed the New York Herald bureau with the window full of clocks.",0
8102,"We had another bottle of wine and Georgette made a joke. She smiled and showed all her bad teeth, and we touched glasses. “You’re not a bad type,” she said. “It’s a shame you’re sick. We get on well. What’s the matter with you, anyway?”  “I got hurt in the war,” I said.",0
8105,"“What dance?”  “Why, the dancings. Don’t you know we’ve revived them?” Mrs. Braddocks put in.",0
8106,"“You must come, Jake. We’re all going,” Frances said from the end of the table. She was tall and had a smile.",0
8108,"She was a Canadian and had all their easy social graces. “Thanks, we’ll be in,” I said. I went back to the small room.",0
8113,"“I wish to present my fiancée, Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc,” I said. Georgette smiled that wonderful smile, and we shook hands all round. “Are you related to Georgette Leblanc, the singer?” Mrs. Braddocks asked.",0
8118,"“Oh, Mademoiselle Hobin,” Frances Clyne called, speaking French very rapidly and not seeming so proud and astonished as Mrs. Braddocks at its coming out really French. “Have you been in Paris long? Do you like it here? You love Paris, do you not?”  “Who’s she?”",0
8121,“I’ve been here long enough.” “But it does have nice people in it. One must grant that.”,0
8132,"“You’re from Kansas City, they tell me,” he said. “Yes.”  “Do you find Paris amusing?”  “Yes.”  “Really?”  I was a little drunk. Not drunk in any positive sense but just enough to be careless.",0
8142,"“And have you had a lovely evening?”  “Oh, priceless,” I said. Brett laughed. “It’s wrong of you, Jake. It’s an insult to all of us. Look at Frances there, and Jo.”",0
8148,"“Oh, well,” I said. “I suppose you like to add them up.”  “Don’t talk like a fool.” “You do.”",0
8159,"“Don’t touch me,” she said. “Please don’t touch me.” “What’s the matter?”  “I can’t stand it.”",0
8164,"“No, but it always gets to be.”  “That’s my fault. Don’t we pay for all the things we do, though?”  She had been looking into my eyes all the time. Her eyes had different depths, sometimes they seemed perfectly flat. Now you could see all the way into them.",0
8171,"“No,” she said. “I think it’s hell on earth.” “It’s good to see each other.”",0
8172,“No. I don’t think it is.”  “Don’t you want to?”  “I have to.” We were sitting now like two strangers. On the right was the Parc Montsouris. The restaurant where they have the pool of live trout and where you can sit and look out over the park was closed and dark. The driver leaned his head around.,0
8173,“Where do you want to go?” I asked. Brett turned her head away.,0
8178,"“Count Mippipopolous, meet my friend Lady Ashley.” “How do you do?” said Brett. “Well, does your Ladyship have a good time here in Paris?” asked Count Mippipopolous, who wore an elk’s tooth on his watch-chain.",0
8183,"“No,” I said. “I must shove off. Seen Cohn?”  “He went home with Frances,” Mrs. Braddock put in.",0
8186,“No. Thanks awfully. I have to go.”  “Really going?” Brett asked.,0
8187,"“Yes,” I said. “I’ve got a rotten headache.” “I’ll see you to-morrow?”  “Come in at the office.”  “Hardly.”",0
8194,"I never used to realize it, I guess. I try and play it along and just not make trouble for people. Probably I never would have had any trouble if I hadn’t run into Brett when they shipped me to England. I suppose she only wanted what she couldn’t have. Well, people were that way. To hell with people. The Catholic Church had an awfully good way of handling all that. Good advice, anyway. Not to think about it. Oh, it was swell advice. Try and take it sometime. Try and take it.",0
8195,"I lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around. Then I couldn’t keep away from it, and I started to think about Brett and all the rest of it went away. I was thinking about Brett and my mind stopped jumping around and started to go in sort of smooth waves. Then all of a sudden I started to cry. Then after a while it was better and I lay in bed and listened to the heavy trams go by and way down the street, and then I went to sleep.",0
8200,"“Will you send her up, please?”  Brett came up the stairs. I saw she was quite drunk. “Silly thing to do,” she said. “Make an awful row. I say, you weren’t asleep, were you?”  “What did you think I was doing?”  “Don’t know.",0
8206,"“Is Zizi really a duke, too?”  “I shouldn’t wonder. Greek, you know. Rotten painter. I rather liked the count.”",0
8208,I told him I couldn’t do it. He was awfully nice about it. Told him I knew too many people in Biarritz.”,0
8209,"Brett laughed. “I say, you are slow on the up-take,” she said. I had only sipped my brandy and soda. I took a long drink.",0
8214,“I’m too far behind you now to catch up and be any fun.”  “Don’t be an ass.”  “Can’t do it.” “Right. Send him a tender message?”  “Anything.,0
8215,"Absolutely.”  “Good night, darling.”  “Don’t be sentimental.” “You make me ill.” We kissed good night and Brett shivered. “I’d better go,” she said. “Good night, darling.”  “You don’t have to go.”",0
8217,"CHAPTER 5 In the morning I walked down the Boulevard to the rue Soufflot for coffee and brioche. It was a fine morning. The horse-chestnut trees in the Luxembourg gardens were in bloom. There was the pleasant early-morning feeling of a hot day. I read the papers with the coffee and then smoked a cigarette. The flower-women were coming up from the market and arranging their daily stock. Students went by going up to the law school, or down to the Sorbonne. The Boulevard was busy with trams and people going to work. I got on an S bus and rode down to the Madeleine, standing on the back platform. From the Madeleine I walked along the Boulevard des Capucines to the Opéra, and up to my office. I passed the man with the jumping frogs and the man with the boxer toys. I stepped aside to avoid walking into the thread with which his girl assistant manipulated the boxers. She was standing looking away, the thread in her folded hands. The man was urging two tourists to buy. Three more tourists had stopped and were watching. I walked on behind a man who was pushing a roller that printed the name CINZANO on the sidewalk in damp letters. All along people were going to work. It felt pleasant to be going to work. I walked across the avenue and turned in to my office.",0
8218,"Up-stairs in the office I read the French morning papers, smoked, and then sat at the typewriter and got off a good morning’s work. At eleven o’clock I went over to the Quai d’Orsay in a taxi and went in and sat with about a dozen correspondents, while the foreign-office mouthpiece, a young Nouvelle Revue Française diplomat in horn-rimmed spectacles, talked and answered questions for half an hour. The President of the Council was in Lyons making a speech, or, rather he was on his way back. Several people asked questions to hear themselves talk and there were a couple of questions asked by news service men who wanted to know the answers. There was no news. I shared a taxi back from the Quai d’Orsay with Woolsey and Krum.",0
8219,"“What do you do nights, Jake?” asked Krum. “I never see you around.” “Oh, I’m over in the Quarter.”",0
8220,"“I’m coming over some night. The Dingo. That’s the great place, isn’t it?”  “Yes.",0
8221,"That, or this new dive, The Select.”  “I’ve meant to get over,” said Krum. “You know how it is, though, with a wife and kids.” “Playing any tennis?” Woolsey asked.",0
8224,“That’s the thing to do. Live out in the country and have a little car.” “I’ve been thinking some about getting a car next year.”,0
8226,"“Thanks, old man,” Krum said. Woolsey shook his head. “I’ve got to file that line he got off this morning.”",0
8231,Let me see if there is anything new.” “Where will we eat?”  “Anywhere.” I was looking over my desk. “Where do you want to eat?”  “How about Wetzel’s?,0
8237,“Tell her to go to hell.” “I can’t. I’ve got certain obligations to her.”,0
8248,"“Sit down,” I said. “Don’t be a fool.” “You’ve got to take that back.”",0
8251,"Cohn smiled again and sat down. He seemed glad to sit down. What the hell would he have done if he hadn’t sat down? “You say such damned insulting things, Jake.”  “I’m sorry.",0
8253,"God help you, I thought. “Forget what I said,” I said out loud. “I’m sorry.”",0
8263,"“What’s the matter?”  “No money. Money hasn’t come,” he paused. “I tell you it’s strange, Jake. When I’m like this I just want to be alone. I want to stay in my own room. I’m like a cat.”",0
8264,"I felt in my pocket. “Would a hundred help you any, Harvey?”  “Yes.”  “Come on. Let’s go and eat.”",0
8267,"Why?”  “What’s he like?”  “He’s all right. He says some pretty funny things. Last time I had dinner with him we talked about Hoffenheimer. ‘The trouble is,’ he said, ‘he’s a garter snapper.’ That’s not bad.”",0
8269,"“Oh, nobody reads him now,” Harvey said, “except the people that used to read the Alexander Hamilton Institute.” “Well,” I said. “That was a good thing, too.”",0
8271,"“There comes Cohn,” I said. Robert Cohn was crossing the street. “That moron,” said Harvey. Cohn came up to our table.",0
8274,"“Don’t think. Bring it right out.” “I don’t know,” Cohn said. “What’s it all about, anyway?”  “I mean what would you rather do.",0
8280,"“Have another porto.” “No,” he said. “I’m going up the street and eat. See you later, Jake.”",0
8281,"He walked out and up the street. I watched him crossing the street through the taxis, small, heavy, slowly sure of himself in the traffic. “He always gets me sore,” Cohn said. “I can’t stand him.”",0
8282,"“I like him,” I said. “I’m fond of him. You don’t want to get sore at him.”",0
8285,"The sort of healthy conceit that he had when he returned from America early in the spring was gone. Then he had been sure of his work, only with these personal longings for adventure. Now the sureness was gone. Somehow I feel I have not shown Robert Cohn clearly. The reason is that until he fell in love with Brett, I never heard him make one remark that would, in any way, detach him from other people. He was nice to watch on the tennis-court, he had a good body, and he kept it in shape; he handled his cards well at bridge, and he had a funny sort of undergraduate quality about him. If he were in a crowd nothing he said stood out. He wore what used to be called polo shirts at school, and may be called that still, but he was not professionally youthful. I do not believe he thought about his clothes much. Externally he had been formed at Princeton. Internally he had been moulded by the two women who had trained him. He had a nice, boyish sort of cheerfulness that had never been trained out of him, and I probably have not brought it out. He loved to win at tennis. He probably loved to win as much as Lenglen, for instance. On the other hand, he was not angry at being beaten. When he fell in love with Brett his tennis game went all to pieces. People beat him who had never had a chance with him. He was very nice about it.",0
8289,"“Why, hello, Robert. Are you here?” She went on, talking rapidly. “I’ve had the darndest time. This one”—shaking her head at Cohn—“didn’t come home for lunch.”",0
8298,"“It’s rotten luck.” “I should say it is rotten luck. I’ve wasted two years and a half on him now. And I don’t know now if any man will ever want to marry me. Two years ago I could have married anybody I wanted, down at Cannes. All the old ones that wanted to marry somebody chic and settle down were crazy about me. Now I don’t think I could get anybody.”",0
8299,"“Sure, you could marry anybody.” “No, I don’t believe it. And I’m fond of him, too. And I’d like to have children. I always thought we’d have children.”",0
8301,"“He’s got children.” “Oh, yes. He’s got children, and he’s got money, and he’s got a rich mother, and he’s written a book, and nobody will publish my stuff; nobody at all. It isn’t bad, either. And I haven’t got any money at all. I could have had alimony, but I got the divorce the quickest way.”",0
8307,"We got up from the table—they had never brought us a drink—and started across the street toward the Select, where Cohn sat smiling at us from behind the marble-topped table. “Well, what are you smiling at?” Frances asked him. “Feel pretty happy?”  “I was smiling at you and Jake with your secrets.”",0
8309,"“What was it? About your going to England?”  “Yes, about my going to England. Oh, Jake! I forgot to tell you. I’m going to England.”  “Isn’t that fine!”",0
8314,"It was very satisfactory to her to have an audience for this. “And where are you going to be, Robert? It’s my own fault, all right. Perfectly my own fault. When I made you get rid of your little secretary on the magazine I ought to have known you’d get rid of me the same way. Jake doesn’t know about that. Should I tell him?”  “Shut up, Frances, for God’s sake.”",0
8320,"As I stood against the bar looking out I could see them through the window. Frances was talking on to him, smiling brightly, looking into his face each time she asked: “Isn’t it so, Robert?” Or maybe she did not ask that now. Perhaps she said something else. I told the barman I did not want anything to drink and went out through the side door. As I went out the door I looked back through the two thicknesses of glass and saw them sitting there. She was still talking to him. I went down a side street to the Boulevard Raspail. A taxi came along and I got in and gave the driver the address of my flat.",0
8322,“Did she leave a card?”  “No. She was with a gentleman. It was the one who was here last night. In the end I find she is very nice.”,0
8325,"The concierge, before she became a concierge, had owned a drink-selling concession at the Paris race-courses. Her life-work lay in the pelouse, but she kept an eye on the people of the pesage, and she took great pride in telling me which of my guests were well brought up, which were of good family, who were sportsmen, a French word pronounced with the accent on the men. The only trouble was that people who did not fall into any of those three categories were very liable to be told there was no one home, chez Barnes. One of my friends, an extremely underfed-looking painter, who was obviously to Madame Duzinell neither well brought up, of good family, nor a sportsman, wrote me a letter asking if I could get him a pass to get by the concierge so he could come up and see me occasionally in the evenings.",0
8327,"“Hello, darling,” said Brett. “Aren’t you going to let us in?”  “Come on. I was just bathing.”  “Aren’t you the fortunate man.",0
8329,"Brett took them. “Get me some water in this, Jake.” I filled the big earthenware jug with water in the kitchen, and Brett put the roses in it, and placed them in the centre of the dining-room table.",0
8331,"Did we have one? I must have been blind.” “You were quite drunk, my dear,” said the count.",0
8332,"“Wasn’t I, though? And the count’s been a brick, absolutely.” “You’ve got hell’s own drag with the concierge now.”",0
8335,"“So do you, my dear.”  “Fancy,” said Brett. “Who’d want to? I say, Jake, do we get a drink?”  “You get it while I go in and dress.",0
8336,"You know where it is.” “Rather.” While I dressed I heard Brett put down glasses and then a siphon, and then heard them talking. I dressed slowly, sitting on the bed. I felt tired and pretty rotten. Brett came in the room, a glass in her hand, and sat on the bed.",0
8341,“Poor old darling.” She stroked my head. “What did you say to him?” I was lying with my face away from her. I did not want to see her.,0
8348,"“You know I love you.” “Let’s not talk. Talking’s all bilge. I’m going away from you, and then Michael’s coming back.”",0
8351,"“Oh, sure,” I said. “I know you’re right. I’m just low, and when I’m low I talk like a fool.”",0
8362,"The count was looking at Brett across the table under the gas-light. She was smoking a cigarette and flicking the ashes on the rug. She saw me notice it. “I say, Jake, I don’t want to ruin your rugs. Can’t you give a chap an ash-tray?”  I found some ash-trays and spread them around.",0
8367,"He lit the cigar, puffed at it, looking across the table at Brett. “And when you’re divorced, Lady Ashley, then you won’t have a title.” “No. What a pity.”  “No,” said the count.",0
8369,"“I’m not joking you,” the count blew a cloud of smoke. “You got the most class of anybody I ever seen. You got it. That’s all.”",0
8372,"“You’re right,” Brett said. “You’re terribly right. I always joke people and I haven’t a friend in the world. Except Jake here.”  “You don’t joke him.”",0
8373,"“That’s it.” “Do you, now?” asked the count. “Do you joke him?”  Brett looked at me and wrinkled up the corners of her eyes.",0
8376,"I’ve talked myself all out to Jake.” “I should like to hear you really talk, my dear. When you talk to me you never finish your sentences at all.”  “Leave ’em for you to finish.",0
8382,"You don’t want to mix emotions up with a wine like that. You lose the taste.”  Brett’s glass was empty. “You ought to write a book on wines, count,” I said.",0
8391,"“See on the back where they come out.” Above the small of the back were the same two scars, raised as thick as a finger. “I say. Those are something.”  “Clean through.”",0
8392,The count was tucking in his shirt. “Where did you get those?” I asked. “In Abyssinia. When I was twenty-one years old.”,0
8395,"Absolutely.”  “I know,” said the count. “That is the secret. You must get to know the values.”  “Doesn’t anything ever happen to your values?”",0
8396,"Brett asked. “No. Not any more.”  “Never fall in love?”  “Always,” said the count. “I am always in love.”",0
8397,"“What does that do to your values?”  “That, too, has got a place in my values.” “You haven’t any values. You’re dead, that’s all.”",0
8400,“Where would you like to go?” asked the count after dinner. We were the only people left in the restaurant. The two waiters were standing over against the door. They wanted to go home.,0
8405,"“Like you like noise, my dear.”  “All right,” said Brett. “Let’s have one.” “Sommelier!” the count called.",0
8413,"“I’ll bet he writes to you.”  “Rather. Damned good letters, too.”  “When are you going to get married?”  “How do I know? As soon as we can get the divorce. Michael’s trying to get his mother to put up for it.”",0
8415,"“Very nice,” he said. “You looked very, very nice.”  “Don’t you dance, count?” I asked.",0
8418,"I support that boy, but I don’t want to have him around.” “He is rather hard.” “You know I think that boy’s got a future. But personally I don’t want him around.”",0
8423,"“Want to go?”  I had the feeling as in a nightmare of it all being something repeated, something I had been through and that now I must go through again. “. . . . . .” the drummer sang softly.",0
8424,"“Let’s go,” said Brett. “You don’t mind.”  “. . . . . .” the drummer shouted and grinned at Brett.",0
8432,"BOOK II   CHAPTER 8 I did not see Brett again until she came back from San Sebastian. One card came from her from there. It had a picture of the Concha, and said: “Darling. Very quiet and healthy. Love to all the chaps. Brett.”",0
8444,Claimed nigger owed them money on account of wrecking hall. Wonder who translated? Was it me?”  “Probably it wasn’t you.”,0
8447,"All we could get was nigger’s clothes. Somebody took his watch, too. Splendid nigger. Big mistake to have come to Vienna. Not so good, Jake. Not so good.”",0
8454,“Mean everything in the world to you after you bought it. Simple exchange of values. You give them money. They give you a stuffed dog.”,0
8455,“We’ll get one on the way back.” “All right. Have it your own way. Road to hell paved with unbought stuffed dogs. Not my fault.”,0
8456,We went on. “How’d you feel that way about dogs so sudden?”  “Always felt that way about dogs. Always been a great lover of stuffed animals.”,0
8460,“You’ll be daunted after about three more pernods.” “Not in public. If I begin to feel daunted I’ll go off by myself. I’m like a cat that way.”,0
8462,"Wish he wouldn’t keep going off like a cat, though. Makes me nervous.” “What’ll we do to-night?”  “Doesn’t make any difference.",0
8463,Only let’s not get daunted. Suppose they got any hard-boiled eggs here? If they had hard-boiled eggs here we wouldn’t have to go all the way down to the island to eat.”,0
8473,"“We might as well go to the Closerie,” Brett said. “I can’t drink these rotten brandies.” “Closerie des Lilas.”",0
8475,"Budapest was wonderful.”  “Ask him about Vienna.” “Vienna,” said Bill, “is a strange city.” “Very much like Paris,” Brett smiled at him, wrinkling the corners of her eyes.",0
8478,"“Did you have a good time?”  “Oh, all right. Interesting. Not frightfully amusing.”  “See anybody?”  “No, hardly anybody.",0
8479,"I never went out.”  “Didn’t you swim?”  “No. Didn’t do a thing.” “Sounds like Vienna,” Bill said. Brett wrinkled up the corners of her eyes at him.",0
8485,"“Well, well,” Bill said. “That’s always just the stage I meet anybody. What’ll I send them? Think they’d like a couple of stuffed race-horses?”  “We better eat.”",0
8486,"“Is she really Lady something or other?” Bill asked in the taxi on our way down to the Ile Saint Louis. “Oh, yes. In the stud-book and everything.”  “Well, well.”",0
8487,"We ate dinner at Madame Lecomte’s restaurant on the far side of the island. It was crowded with Americans and we had to stand up and wait for a place. Some one had put it in the American Women’s Club list as a quaint restaurant on the Paris quais as yet untouched by Americans, so we had to wait forty-five minutes for a table. Bill had eaten at the restaurant in 1918, and right after the armistice, and Madame Lecomte made a great fuss over seeing him.",0
8489,"“You’ve got the world here all right,” Bill said to Madame Lecomte. She raised her hand. “Oh, my God!”  “You’ll be rich.”",0
8490,"“I hope so.” After the coffee and a fine we got the bill, chalked up the same as ever on a slate, that was doubtless one of the “quaint” features, paid it, shook hands, and went out. “You never come here any more, Monsieur Barnes,” Madame Lecomte said.",0
8492,We walked along under the trees that grew out over the river on the Quai d’Orléans side of the island. Across the river were the broken walls of old houses that were being torn down. “They’re going to cut a street through.”,0
8509,"Remember there are ladies at this bar.”  “Isn’t she a lovely piece? Don’t you think so, Jake?”  “There’s a fight to-night,” Bill said. “Like to go?”  “Fight,” said Mike.",0
8510,"“Who’s fighting?”  “Ledoux and somebody.” “He’s very good, Ledoux,” Mike said. “I’d like to see it, rather”—he was making an effort to pull himself together—“but I can’t go. I had a date with this thing here. I say, Brett, do get a new hat.”",0
8511,Brett pulled the felt hat down far over one eye and smiled out from under it. “You two run along to the fight. I’ll have to be taking Mr. Campbell home directly.”,0
8515,"Outside on the pavement I said: “Do you want to go to the fight?”  “Sure,” said Bill. “If we don’t have to walk.” “Mike was pretty excited about his girl friend,” I said in the taxi.",0
8519,"“Disgraceful business.”  “Look,” said Mike, “when do you go down to Spain? Would you mind if we came down with you?”  “It would be grand.” “You wouldn’t mind, really? I’ve been at Pamplona, you know. Brett’s mad to go. You’re sure we wouldn’t just be a bloody nuisance?”  “Don’t talk like a fool.”",0
8522,"Bill and I go down on the morning of the 25th.” “By the way, where is Bill?” Brett asked.",0
8530,"“We have got the loveliest hotel,” Mike said. “I think it’s a brothel!” “We left our bags here at the Dingo when we got in, and they asked us at this hotel if we wanted a room for the afternoon only. Seemed frightfully pleased we were going to stay all night.”",0
8533,"We walked up the Rue Delambre. “I haven’t seen you since I’ve been back,” Brett said. “No.”  “How are you, Jake?”  “Fine.”  Brett looked at me.",0
8534,"“I say,” she said, “is Robert Cohn going on this trip?”  “Yes. Why?”  “Don’t you think it will be a bit rough on him?”  “Why should it?”  “Who did you think I went down to San Sebastian with?”  “Congratulations,” I said. We walked along.",0
8539,“My God!”  “I thought it was rather odd myself.” “Says he can’t wait to see me.” “Does he think you’re coming alone?”  “No.,0
8549,"“They’ve got seven cars of them from Dayton, Ohio. They’ve been on a pilgrimage to Rome, and now they’re going down to Biarritz and Lourdes.” “So, that’s what they are. Pilgrims. Goddam Puritans,” Bill said.",0
8552,"“Mighty little fishing you did on them trips,” his wife said. He winked at us. “You know how the ladies are. If there’s a jug goes along, or a case of beer, they think it’s hell and damnation.”",0
8553,"“That’s the way men are,” his wife said to us. She smoothed her comfortable lap. “I voted against prohibition to please him, and because I like a little beer in the house, and then he talks that way. It’s a wonder they ever find any one to marry them.”  “Say,” said Bill, “do you know that gang of Pilgrim Fathers have cornered the dining-car until half past three this afternoon?”  “How do you mean?",0
8555,"She stood up and straightened her dress. “Will you boys keep an eye on our things? Come on, Hubert.”",0
8556,"They all three went up to the wagon restaurant. A little while after they were gone a steward went through announcing the first service, and pilgrims, with their priests, commenced filing down the corridor. Our friend and his family did not come back. A waiter passed in the corridor with our sandwiches and the bottle of Chablis, and we called him in.",0
8559,"We ate the sandwiches and drank the Chablis and watched the country out of the window. The grain was just beginning to ripen and the fields were full of poppies. The pastureland was green, and there were fine trees, and sometimes big rivers and chateaux off in the trees.",0
8563,"“They thought we were snappers, all right,” the man said. “It certainly shows you the power of the Catholic Church. It’s a pity you boys ain’t Catholics. You could get a meal, then, all right.”",0
8568,"The train stopped for half an hour at Bordeaux and we went out through the station for a little walk. There was not time to get in to the town. Afterward we passed through the Landes and watched the sun set. There were wide fire-gaps cut through the pines, and you could look up them like avenues and see wooded hills way off. About seven-thirty we had dinner and watched the country through the open window in the diner. It was all sandy pine country full of heather. There were little clearings with houses in them, and once in a while we passed a sawmill. It got dark and we could feel the country hot and sandy and dark outside of the window, and about nine o’clock we got into Bayonne. The man and his wife and Hubert all shook hands with us. They were going on to LaNegresse to change for Biarritz.",0
8570,"We got off with our bags and rod-cases and passed through the dark station and out to the lights and the line of cabs and hotel buses. There, standing with the hotel runners, was Robert Cohn. He did not see us at first. Then he started forward.",0
8577,"We went out into the street again and took a look at the cathedral. Cohn made some remark about it being a very good example of something or other, I forget what. It seemed like a nice cathedral, nice and dim, like Spanish churches. Then we went up past the old fort and out to the local Syndicat d’Initiative office, where the bus was supposed to start from. There they told us the bus service did not start until the 1st of July. We found out at the tourist office what we ought to pay for a motor-car to Pamplona and hired one at a big garage just around the corner from the Municipal Theatre for four hundred francs. The car was to pick us up at the hotel in forty minutes, and we stopped at the café on the square where we had eaten breakfast, and had a beer. It was hot, but the town had a cool, fresh, early-morning smell and it was pleasant sitting in the café. A breeze started to blow, and you could feel that the air came from the sea. There were pigeons out in the square, and the houses were a yellow, sun-baked color, and I did not want to leave the café. But we had to go to the hotel to get our bags packed and pay the bill. We paid for the beers, we matched and I think Cohn paid, and went up to the hotel. It was only sixteen francs apiece for Bill and me, with ten per cent added for the service, and we had the bags sent down and waited for Robert Cohn. While we were waiting I saw a cockroach on the parquet floor that must have been at least three inches long. I pointed him out to Bill and then put my shoe on him. We agreed he must have just come in from the garden. It was really an awfully clean hotel.",0
8580,"I asked him if he ever fished, and he said no, that he didn’t care for it. Just then an old man with long, sunburned hair and beard, and clothes that looked as though they were made of gunny-sacking, came striding up to the bridge. He was carrying a long staff, and he had a kid slung on his back, tied by the four legs, the head hanging down.",0
8581,"The carabineer waved him back with his sword. The man turned without saying anything, and started back up the white road into Spain. “What’s the matter with the old one?” I asked.",0
8582,“He hasn’t got any passport.” I offered the guard a cigarette. He took it and thanked me.,0
8583,“What will he do?” I asked. The guard spat in the dust.,0
8584,"“Oh, he’ll just wade across the stream.” “Do you have much smuggling?”  “Oh,” he said, “they go through.” The chauffeur came out, folding up the papers and putting them in the inside pocket of his coat. We all got in the car and it started up the white dusty road into Spain. For a while the country was much as it had been; then, climbing all the time, we crossed the top of a Col, the road winding back and forth on itself, and then it was really Spain. There were long brown mountains and a few pines and far-off forests of beech-trees on some of the mountainsides. The road went along the summit of the Col and then dropped down, and the driver had to honk, and slow up, and turn out to avoid running into two donkeys that were sleeping in the road. We came down out of the mountains and through an oak forest, and there were white cattle grazing in the forest. Down below there were grassy plains and clear streams, and then we crossed a stream and went through a gloomy little village, and started to climb again. We climbed up and up and crossed another high Col and turned along it, and the road ran down to the right, and we saw a whole new range of mountains off to the south, all brown and baked-looking and furrowed in strange shapes.",0
8591,"I saw he was angry and wanted to smooth him down. “It’s a sure thing they’ll come,” I said. “But maybe not to-night.”  “Want to call it off?”",0
8594,"“I’m satisfied,” Cohn said. He smiled. “You’ll probably win it back at bridge, anyway.”",0
8599,"“The barber shop’s closed,” Cohn said. “It’s not open till four.” We had coffee at the Iruña, sitting in comfortable wicker chairs looking out from the cool of the arcade at the big square. After a while Bill went to write some letters and Cohn went over to the barber-shop. It was still closed, so he decided to go up to the hotel and get a bath, and I sat out in front of the café and then went for a walk in the town. It was very hot, but I kept on the shady side of the streets and went through the market and had a good time seeing the town again. I went to the Ayuntamiento and found the old gentleman who subscribes for the bull-fight tickets for me every year, and he had gotten the money I sent him from Paris and renewed my subscriptions, so that was all set. He was the archivist, and all the archives of the town were in his office. That has nothing to do with the story. Anyway, his office had a green baize door and a big wooden door, and when I went out I left him sitting among the archives that covered all the walls, and I shut both the doors, and as I went out of the building into the street the porter stopped me to brush off my coat.",0
8605,"“I knew they wouldn’t come,” Robert said. We were going back to the hotel. “I thought they might,” I said.",0
8626,“I wish I could go. We’ve been looking forward to this fishing all winter.” He was being sentimental about it. “But I ought to stay. I really ought. As soon as they come I’ll bring them right up.”  “Let’s find Bill.”,0
8634,"What’s all this about him and Brett, anyway? Did she ever have anything to do with him?”  He raised his chin up and pulled it from side to side. “Sure. She went down to San Sebastian with him.”",0
8635,“What a damn-fool thing to do. Why did she do that?”  “She wanted to get out of town and she can’t go anywhere alone. She said she thought it would be good for him.”,0
8636,"“What bloody-fool things people do. Why didn’t she go off with some of her own people? Or you?”—he slurred that over—“or me? Why not me?” He looked at his face carefully in the glass, put a big dab of lather on each cheek-bone. “It’s an honest face. It’s a face any woman would be safe with.”",0
8642,"Finally, after a couple more false klaxons, the bus started, and Robert Cohn waved good-by to us, and all the Basques waved good-by to him. As soon as we started out on the road outside of town it was cool. It felt nice riding high up and close under the trees. The bus went quite fast and made a good breeze, and as we went out along the road with the dust powdering the trees and down the hill, we had a fine view, back through the trees, of the town rising up from the bluff above the river. The Basque lying against my knees pointed out the view with the neck of the wine-bottle, and winked at us. He nodded his head.",0
8644,“Arriba! Arriba!” he said. “Lift it up.”,0
8645,"Bill raised the wine-skin and let the stream of wine spurt out and into his mouth, his head tipped back. When he stopped drinking and tipped the leather bottle down a few drops ran down his chin. “No! No!” several Basques said. “Not like that.” One snatched the bottle away from the owner, who was himself about to give a demonstration. He was a young fellow and he held the wine-bottle at full arms’ length and raised it high up, squeezing the leather bag with his hand so the stream of wine hissed into his mouth. He held the bag out there, the wine making a flat, hard trajectory into his mouth, and he kept on swallowing smoothly and regularly.",0
8648,"We passed through a town and stopped in front of the posada, and the driver took on several packages. Then we started on again, and outside the town the road commenced to mount. We were going through farming country with rocky hills that sloped down into the fields. The grain-fields went up the hillsides. Now as we went higher there was a wind blowing the grain. The road was white and dusty, and the dust rose under the wheels and hung in the air behind us. The road climbed up into the hills and left the rich grain-fields below. Now there were only patches of grain on the bare hillsides and on each side of the water-courses. We turned sharply out to the side of the road to give room to pass to a long string of six mules, following one after the other, hauling a high-hooded wagon loaded with freight. The wagon and the mules were covered with dust. Close behind was another string of mules and another wagon. This was loaded with lumber, and the arriero driving the mules leaned back and put on the thick wooden brakes as we passed. Up here the country was quite barren and the hills were rocky and hard-baked clay furrowed by the rain.",0
8652,"“Forty years ago.”  He was an old man, as brown as the others, with the stubble of a white beard. “How was it?”  “What you say?”  “How was America?”  “Oh, I was in California. It was fine.”",0
8656,"“What you come over here for?”  “We’re going to the fiesta at Pamplona.” “You like the bull-fights?”  “Sure. Don’t you?”  “Yes,” he said. “I guess I like them.”",0
8658,"The bus climbed steadily up the road. The country was barren and rocks stuck up through the clay. There was no grass beside the road. Looking back we could see the country spread out below. Far back the fields were squares of green and brown on the hillsides. Making the horizon were the brown mountains. They were strangely shaped. As we climbed higher the horizon kept changing. As the bus ground slowly up the road we could see other mountains coming up in the south. Then the road came over the crest, flattened out, and went into a forest. It was a forest of cork oaks, and the sun came through the trees in patches, and there were cattle grazing back in the trees. We went through the forest and the road came out and turned along a rise of land, and out ahead of us was a rolling green plain, with dark mountains beyond it. These were not like the brown, heat-baked mountains we had left behind. These were wooded and there were clouds coming down from them. The green plain stretched off. It was cut by fences and the white of the road showed through the trunks of a double line of trees that crossed the plain toward the north. As we came to the edge of the rise we saw the red roofs and white houses of Burguete ahead strung out on the plain, and away off on the shoulder of the first dark mountain was the gray metal-sheathed roof of the monastery of Roncesvalles.",0
8663,“Is that all right?” I asked. “Yes. Of course.”,0
8669,"“Is the wine included?”  “Oh, yes.”  “Well,” I said. “It’s all right.” I went back to Bill. He blew his breath at me to show how cold it was, and went on playing. I sat at one of the tables and looked at the pictures on the wall. There was one panel of rabbits, dead, one of pheasants, also dead, and one panel of dead ducks. The panels were all dark and smoky-looking. There was a cupboard full of liqueur bottles. I looked at them all. Bill was still playing. “How about a hot rum punch?” he said. “This isn’t going to keep me warm permanently.”",0
8673,After supper we went up-stairs and smoked and read in bed to keep warm. Once in the night I woke and heard the wind blowing. It felt good to be warm and in bed.,0
8674,"CHAPTER 12 When I woke in the morning I went to the window and looked out. It had cleared and there were no clouds on the mountains. Outside under the window were some carts and an old diligence, the wood of the roof cracked and split by the weather. It must have been left from the days before the motor-buses. A goat hopped up on one of the carts and then to the roof of the diligence. He jerked his head at the other goats below and when I waved at him he bounded down.",0
8677,"Splendid. I want you to do that every morning.”  “Come on,” I said. “Get up.”  “What?",0
8681,"“Oh, go to hell!” “Work for the good of all.” Bill stepped into his underclothes. “Show irony and pity.”",0
8682,"I started out of the room with the tackle-bag, the nets, and the rod-case. “Hey! come back!” I put my head in the door.",0
8699,"“It wasn’t a bicycle,” I said. “He was riding horseback.” “I heard it was a tricycle.”",0
8700,"“Well,” I said. “A plane is sort of like a tricycle. The joystick works the same way.”",0
8702,"“I think he’s a good writer, too,” Bill said. “And you’re a hell of a good guy. Anybody ever tell you you were a good guy?”  “I’m not a good guy.”  “Listen.",0
8708,"It was a beech wood and the trees were very old. Their roots bulked above the ground and the branches were twisted. We walked on the road between the thick trunks of the old beeches and the sunlight came through the leaves in light patches on the grass. The trees were big, and the foliage was thick but it was not gloomy. There was no undergrowth, only the smooth grass, very green and fresh, and the big gray trees well spaced as though it were a park.",0
8710,"Ahead the road came out of the forest and went along the shoulder of the ridge of hills. The hills ahead were not wooded, and there were great fields of yellow gorse. Way off we saw the steep bluffs, dark with trees and jutting with gray stone, that marked the course of the Irati River.",0
8711,"“We have to follow this road along the ridge, cross these hills, go through the woods on the far hills, and come down to the Irati valley,” I pointed out to Bill. “That’s a hell of a hike.” “It’s too far to go and fish and come back the same day, comfortably.”  “Comfortably.",0
8714,"Bill put the pack against one of the trees and we jointed up the rods, put on the reels, tied on leaders, and got ready to fish. “You’re sure this thing has trout in it?” Bill asked.",0
8718,"“No, I don’t want one. If they won’t take a fly I’ll just flick it around.” Bill was down below watching the stream.",0
8726,“How are yours?”  “Smaller.”  “Let’s see them.”  “They’re packed.”  “How big are they really?”  “They’re all about the size of your smallest.” “You’re not holding out on me?”  “I wish I were.” “Get them all on worms?”  “Yes.”  “You lazy bum!”,0
8732,“Then the chicken. Even Bryan could see that.” “He’s dead. I read it in the paper yesterday.”,0
8737,"“Utilize a little of this.” We uncorked the other bottle. “What’s the matter?” I said. “Didn’t you like Bryan?”  “I loved Bryan,” said Bill.",0
8747,"I shut my eyes. It felt good lying on the ground. “Say,” Bill said, “what about this Brett business?”  “What about it?”  “Were you ever in love with her?”  “Sure.”  “For how long?”  “Off and on for a hell of a long time.”",0
8749,"“It’s all right,” I said. “I don’t give a damn any more.”  “Really?”  “Really. Only I’d a hell of a lot rather not talk about it.”",0
8750,"“You aren’t sore I asked you?”  “Why the hell should I be?”  “I’m going to sleep,” Bill said. He put a newspaper over his face.",0
8753,“What did you do? Wake up?” Bill asked. “Why didn’t you spend the night?” I stretched and rubbed my eyes.,0
8758,He had the pack on his back and I put the worm-cans in one of the outside flap pockets. “You got everything now?”  I looked around on the grass at the foot of the elm-trees.,0
8759,"“Yes.” We started up the road into the woods. It was a long walk home to Burguete, and it was dark when we came down across the fields to the road, and along the road between the houses of the town, their windows lighted, to the inn.",0
8775,"“What does the word Cohn mean?” he asked. “What a lousy telegram!” I said. “He could send ten words for the same price. ‘I come Thursday.’ That gives you a lot of dope, doesn’t it?”  “It gives you all the dope that’s of interest to Cohn.”",0
8783,"“It looks to me like a pub,” I said. “I say,” said Harris, “let’s utilize it.” He had taken up utilizing from Bill.",0
8792,"“Good old Harris.”  “I say. You know my name isn’t really Harris. It’s Wilson-Harris. All one name. With a hyphen, you know.”  “Good old Wilson-Harris,” Bill said.",0
8796,"“I say, Harris—” I began. “No, no!” he said. He was climbing down from the bus. “They’re not first-rate flies at all. I only thought if you fished them some time it might remind you of what a good time we had.”",0
8801,"“Your friends are here,” he said. “Mr. Campbell?”  “Yes. Mr. Cohn and Mr. Campbell and Lady Ashley.”",0
8804,"“And how about the bulls?”  Montoya smiled. “To-night,” he said. “To-night at seven o’clock they bring in the Villar bulls, and to-morrow come the Miuras. Do you all go down?”  “Oh, yes.",0
8809,"He put his hand on my shoulder again embarrassedly. “Yes,” I said. “He’s a real aficionado.”",0
8811,"We often talked about bulls and bull-fighters. I had stopped at the Montoya for several years. We never talked for very long at a time. It was simply the pleasure of discovering what we each felt. Men would come in from distant towns and before they left Pamplona stop and talk for a few minutes with Montoya about bulls. These men were aficionados. Those who were aficionados could always get rooms even when the hotel was full. Montoya introduced me to some of them. They were always very polite at first, and it amused them very much that I should be an American. Somehow it was taken for granted that an American could not have aficion. He might simulate it or confuse it with excitement, but he could not really have it. When they saw that I had aficion, and there was no password, no set questions that could bring it out, rather it was a sort of oral spiritual examination with the questions always a little on the defensive and never apparent, there was this same embarrassed putting the hand on the shoulder, or a “Buen hombre.” But nearly always there was the actual touching. It seemed as though they wanted to touch you to make it certain.",0
8812,"Montoya could forgive anything of a bull-fighter who had aficion. He could forgive attacks of nerves, panic, bad unexplainable actions, all sorts of lapses. For one who had aficion he could forgive anything. At once he forgave me all my friends. Without his ever saying anything they were simply a little something shameful between us, like the spilling open of the horses in bull-fighting.",0
8814,"“Have you got tickets?”  “Yes. I got them for all the unloadings.” “What’s it like?” He was pulling his cheek before the glass, looking to see if there were unshaved patches under the line of the jaw.",0
8819,"“Hello, you chaps!” she called. Brett was happy. Mike had a way of getting an intensity of feeling into shaking hands. Robert Cohn shook hands because we were back.",0
8823,“Did you get good fishing?” Mike asked. “We wanted to join you.”,0
8825,“You bring us. What rot.”  “Was it really good?” Mike asked. “Did you take many?”  “Some days we took a dozen apiece.,0
8827,"“Fortunate fellow,” Mike said. “What times we had. How I wish those dear days were back.”  “Don’t be an ass.”  “Were you in the war, Mike?”",0
8830,“I’ll not tell that story. It reflects discredit on me.” “Tell them about your medals.”,0
8840,"“I had a lot of friends. False friends. Then I had creditors, too. Probably had more creditors than anybody in England.”",0
8864,"“I say,” Mike said, “they were fine bulls, weren’t they? Did you see their horns?”  “Did I not,” said Brett. “I had no idea what they were like.”",0
8865,“Did you see the one hit that steer?” Mike asked. “That was extraordinary.”,0
8866,"“It’s no life being a steer,” Robert Cohn said. “Don’t you think so?” Mike said. “I would have thought you’d loved being a steer, Robert.”  “What do you mean, Mike?”  “They lead such a quiet life.",0
8869,"“I said something, Mike. Don’t you remember? About the steers.”",0
8872,"Try and show a little breeding.” “Breeding be damned. Who has any breeding, anyway, except the bulls? Aren’t the bulls lovely? Don’t you like them, Bill? Why don’t you say something, Robert? Don’t sit there looking like a bloody funeral. What if Brett did sleep with you? She’s slept with lots of better people than you.”  “Shut up,” Cohn said.",0
8874,"You’re drunk.” “Perhaps I am drunk. Why aren’t you drunk? Why don’t you ever get drunk, Robert? You know you didn’t have a good time at San Sebastian because none of our friends would invite you on any of the parties. You can’t blame them hardly. Can you? I asked them to. They wouldn’t do it. You can’t blame them, now. Can you? Now, answer me. Can you blame them?”  “Go to hell, Mike.”",0
8878,"“I say, Michael, you might not be such a bloody ass,” she interrupted. “I’m not saying he’s not right, you know.” She turned to me.",0
8885,"“You wouldn’t read any letters, darling. You wouldn’t read mine.” “I can’t read letters,” Mike said. “Funny, isn’t it?”  “You can’t read anything.”  “No.",0
8887,"“You’ll be writing next,” Brett said. “Come on, Michael. Do buck up. You’ve got to go through with this thing now. He’s here. Don’t spoil the fiesta.”",0
8890,"“Oh, no. I can’t.” “Go on. We’re all friends. Aren’t we all friends, Jake?”  “I can’t tell him.",0
8894,"“That was nothing,” Brett said. “He can write a damned amusing letter.” “She made me write that. She was supposed to be ill.”",0
8901,“I know what you mean.” “They’re all right.” “Yes. They’re all right.”,0
8907,“We’ve got to keep Mike from getting so tight. That kind of stuff is terrible.” “We’d better get cleaned up for supper.”,0
8911,"CHAPTER 14 I do not know what time I got to bed. I remember undressing, putting on a bathrobe, and standing out on the balcony. I knew I was quite drunk, and when I came in I put on the light over the head of the bed and started to read. I was reading a book by Turgenieff. Probably I read the same two pages over several times. It was one of the stories in “A Sportsman’s Sketches.” I had read it before, but it seemed quite new. The country became very clear and the feeling of pressure in my head seemed to loosen. I was very drunk and I did not want to shut my eyes because the room would go round and round. If I kept on reading that feeling would pass.",0
8913,"I figured that all out once, and for six months I never slept with the electric light off. That was another bright idea. To hell with women, anyway. To hell with you, Brett Ashley.",0
8920,"Outside, the fence that led from the last street of the town to the entrance of the bull-ring was already in place and made a long pen; the crowd would come running down with the bulls behind them on the morning of the day of the first bull-fight. Out across the plain, where the horse and cattle fair would be, some gypsies had camped under the trees. The wine and aguardiente sellers were putting up their booths. One booth advertised ANIS DEL TORO. The cloth sign hung against the planks in the hot sun. In the big square that was the centre of the town there was no change yet. We sat in the white wicker chairs on the terrasse of the café and watched the motor-buses come in and unload peasants from the country coming in to the market, and we watched the buses fill up and start out with peasants sitting with their saddle-bags full of the things they had bought in the town. The tall gray motor-buses were the only life of the square except for the pigeons and the man with a hose who sprinkled the gravelled square and watered the streets.",0
8921,"In the evening was the paseo. For an hour after dinner every one, all the good-looking girls, the officers from the garrison, all the fashionable people of the town, walked in the street on one side of the square while the café tables filled with the regular after-dinner crowd. During the morning I usually sat in the café and read the Madrid papers and then walked in the town or out into the country. Sometimes Bill went along. Sometimes he wrote in his room. Robert Cohn spent the mornings studying Spanish or trying to get a shave at the barber-shop. Brett and Mike never got up until noon. We all had a vermouth at the café. It was a quiet life and no one was drunk. I went to church a couple of times, once with Brett. She said she wanted to hear me go to confession, but I told her that not only was it impossible but it was not as interesting as it sounded, and, besides, it would be in a language she did not know. We met Cohn as we came out of church, and although it was obvious he had followed us, yet he was very pleasant and nice, and we all three went for a walk out to the gypsy camp, and Brett had her fortune told.",0
8932,"“Where’s Brett and Mike?” Bill asked. “I’ll go and get them,” Cohn said.",0
8936,"We stood at the counter. They had Brett seated on a wine-cask. It was dark in the wine-shop and full of men singing, hard-voiced singing. Back of the counter they drew the wine from casks. I put down money for the wine, but one of the men picked it up and put it back in my pocket.",0
8941,"It doesn’t leak.” “I want another one, too. A big one.”",0
8942,"He took down a big one that would hold a gallon or more, from the roof. He blew it up, his cheeks puffing ahead of the wine-skin, and stood on the bota holding on to a chair. “What are you going to do? Sell them in Bayonne?”  “No. Drink out of them.”",0
8949,"“I don’t want to eat up your meal,” I said when some one handed me a fork. “Eat,” he said. “What do you think it’s here for?”  I unscrewed the nozzle of the big wine-bottle and handed it around.",0
8954,"“How should we know,” Bill said. “I think he’s dead.” “He’s not dead,” Mike said. “I know he’s not dead. He’s just passed out on Anis del Mono.”",0
8955,"As he said Anis del Mono one of the men at the table looked up, brought out a bottle from inside his smock, and handed it to me. “No,” I said. “No, thanks!”  “Yes.",0
8965,"Cohn stood there. His sleep had made him quite all right. “Do let’s go and eat,” Brett said. “I must get a bath.”  “Come on,” Bill said.",0
8966,“Let’s translate Brett to the hotel.” We said good-bye to many people and shook hands with many people and went out. Outside it was dark.,0
8974,“How did Brett like it?”  “It was all so sudden there wasn’t any time for it to bother anybody.” “I wish I’d been up.” “We didn’t know where you were. We went to your room but it was locked.”,0
8976,"Bill opened the door and put his head in. “Where were you, Jake?”  “I saw them go through from the balcony. How was it?”  “Grand.”  “Where you going?”  “To sleep.”",0
8977,"No one was up before noon. We ate at tables set out under the arcade. The town was full of people. We had to wait for a table. After lunch we went over to the Iruña. It had filled up, and as the time for the bull-fight came it got fuller, and the tables were crowded closer. There was a close, crowded hum that came every day before the bull-fight. The café did not make this same noise at any other time, no matter how crowded it was. This hum went on, and we were in it and a part of it.",0
8978,"I had taken six seats for all the fights. Three of them were barreras, the first row at the ring-side, and three were sobrepuertos, seats with wooden backs, half-way up the amphitheatre. Mike thought Brett had best sit high up for her first time, and Cohn wanted to sit with them. Bill and I were going to sit in the barreras, and I gave the extra ticket to a waiter to sell. Bill said something to Cohn about what to do and how to look so he would not mind the horses. Bill had seen one season of bull-fights.",0
8980,"“Watch the charge and see the picador try and keep the bull off, but then don’t look again until the horse is dead if it’s been hit.” “I’m a little nervy about it,” Brett said. “I’m worried whether I’ll be able to go through with it all right.”  “You’ll be all right.",0
8986,"“Do you want to meet Pedro Romero?”  “Fine,” said Bill. “Let’s go see him.” We followed Montoya up a flight and down the corridor.",0
8988,"“You go to the bull-fight,” he said in English. “You know English,” I said, feeling like an idiot. “No,” he answered, and smiled.",0
8989,One of three men who had been sitting on the beds came up and asked us if we spoke French. “Would you like me to interpret for you? Is there anything you would like to ask Pedro Romero?”  We thanked him.,0
8993,"“We’ll see how he is in the ring,” Montoya said. We found the big leather wine-bottle leaning against the wall in my room, took it and the field-glasses, locked the door, and went down-stairs. It was a good bull-fight. Bill and I were very excited about Pedro Romero. Montoya was sitting about ten places away. After Romero had killed his first bull Montoya caught my eye and nodded his head. This was a real one. There had not been a real one for a long time. Of the other two matadors, one was very fair and the other was passable. But there was no comparison with Romero, although neither of his bulls was much.",0
8998,"“They’re not all the same,” Bill said. “They dance differently to all the different tunes.” “It’s swell dancing.”",0
9003,"“She couldn’t take her eyes off them,” Mike said. “She’s an extraordinary wench.” “They do have some rather awful things happen to them,” Brett said. “I couldn’t look away, though.”",0
9004,"“Did you feel all right?”  “I didn’t feel badly at all.”  “Robert Cohn did,” Mike put in. “You were quite green, Robert.” “The first horse did bother me,” Cohn said.",0
9007,“I thought he was going to be sick.” “I never felt that bad. It was just for a minute.”,0
9008,"“I thought he was going to be sick. You weren’t bored, were you, Robert?”  “Let up on that, Mike. I said I was sorry I said it.”",0
9011,"“He said Brett was a sadist,” Mike said. “Brett’s not a sadist. She’s just a lovely, healthy wench.”  “Are you a sadist, Brett?”",0
9013,"Bill got Mike started on something else than Cohn. The waiter brought the absinthe glasses. “Did you really like it?” Bill asked Cohn.  “No, I can’t say I liked it.",0
9016,"“It is a bit strong just at the start,” Brett said. “There’s a dreadful moment for me just when the bull starts for the horse.” “The bulls were fine,” Cohn said.",0
9018,"“She wants to see the bull-fighters close by,” Mike said. “They are something,” Brett said. “That Romero lad is just a child.”",0
9020,"The bull-fight on the second day was much better than on the first. Brett sat between Mike and me at the barrera, and Bill and Cohn went up above. Romero was the whole show. I do not think Brett saw any other bull-fighter. No one else did either, except the hard-shelled technicians. It was all Romero. There were two other matadors, but they did not count. I sat beside Brett and explained to Brett what it was all about. I told her about watching the bull, not the horse, when the bulls charged the picadors, and got her to watching the picador place the point of his pic so that she saw what it was all about, so that it became more something that was going on with a definite end, and less of a spectacle with unexplained horrors. I had her watch how Romero took the bull away from a fallen horse with his cape, and how he held him with the cape and turned him, smoothly and suavely, never wasting the bull. She saw how Romero avoided every brusque movement and saved his bulls for the last when he wanted them, not winded and discomposed but smoothly worn down. She saw how close Romero always worked to the bull, and I pointed out to her the tricks the other bull-fighters used to make it look as though they were working closely. She saw why she liked Romero’s cape-work and why she did not like the others.",0
9022,"“I’ve never seen him do an awkward thing,” Brett said. “You won’t until he gets frightened,” I said. “He’ll never be frightened,” Mike said. “He knows too damned much.”",0
9024,"“I believe, you know, that she’s falling in love with this bull-fighter chap,” Mike said. “I wouldn’t be surprised.” “Be a good chap, Jake. Don’t tell her anything more about him. Tell her how they beat their old mothers.”",0
9026,"“Doesn’t he?” I said. They had hitched the mules to the dead bull and then the whips cracked, the men ran, and the mules, straining forward, their legs pushing, broke into a gallop, and the bull, one horn up, his head on its side, swept a swath smoothly across the sand and out the red gate.",0
9027,"“This next is the last one.” “Not really,” Brett said. She leaned forward on the barrera. Romero waved his picadors to their places, then stood, his cape against his chest, looking across the ring to where the bull would come out.",0
9028,"After it was over we went out and were pressed tight in the crowd. “These bull-fights are hell on one,” Brett said. “I’m limp as a rag.”",0
9029,"“Oh, you’ll get a drink,” Mike said. The next day Pedro Romero did not fight. It was Miura bulls, and a very bad bull-fight. The next day there was no bull-fight scheduled. But all day and all night the fiesta kept on.",0
9030,"CHAPTER 16 In the morning it was raining. A fog had come over the mountains from the sea. You could not see the tops of the mountains. The plateau was dull and gloomy, and the shapes of the trees and the houses were changed. I walked out beyond the town to look at the weather. The bad weather was coming over the mountains from the sea.",0
9036,"“Everybody knows the American ambassador.” “He’s here in town, now.” “Yes,” I said. “Everybody’s seen them.”",0
9037,"“I’ve seen them, too,” Montoya said. He didn’t say anything. I went on shaving.",0
9038,"“Sit down,” I said. “Let me send for a drink.” “No, I have to go.”",0
9039,"I finished shaving and put my face down into the bowl and washed it with cold water. Montoya was standing there looking more embarrassed. “Look,” he said. “I’ve just had a message from them at the Grand Hotel that they want Pedro Romero and Marcial Lalanda to come over for coffee to-night after dinner.”",0
9044,"“Yes, like Algabeno.”  “They’re a fine lot,” I said. “There’s one American woman down here now that collects bull-fighters.” “I know. They only want the young ones.”",0
9047,"“Won’t you have a drink?” I asked. “No,” said Montoya, “I have to go.” He went out.",0
9049,They were well ahead of me and it was no use trying to catch them. Bill was buying shoe-shines for Mike. Bootblacks opened the street door and each one Bill called over and started to work on Mike.,0
9054,"Pedro Romero said he had learned a little English in Gibraltar. He was born in Ronda. That is not far above Gibraltar. He started bull-fighting in Malaga in the bull-fighting school there. He had only been at it three years. The bull-fight critic joked him about the number of Malagueño expressions he used. He was nineteen years old, he said. His older brother was with him as a banderillero, but he did not live in this hotel. He lived in a smaller hotel with the other people who worked for Romero. He asked me how many times I had seen him in the ring. I told him only three. It was really only two, but I did not want to explain after I had made the mistake.",0
9055,"“Where did you see me the other time? In Madrid?”  “Yes,” I lied. I had read the accounts of his two appearances in Madrid in the bull-fight papers, so I was all right.",0
9056,"“The first or the second time?”  “The first.”  “I was very bad,” he said. “The second time I was better. You remember?” He turned to the critic.",0
9059,"When he said this he smiled, anxious that neither the bull-fight critic nor I would think he was boasting. “I am anxious to see it,” the critic said. “I would like to be convinced.”",0
9060,“He doesn’t like my work much.” Romero turned to me. He was serious.,0
9061,"The critic explained that he liked it very much, but that so far it had been incomplete. “Wait till to-morrow, if a good one comes out.” “Have you seen the bulls for to-morrow?” the critic asked me.",0
9066,"“They’re horns all right.” “They’re very short,” said Pedro Romero. “Very, very short. Still, they aren’t bananas.”",0
9067,"“I say, Jake,” Brett called from the next table, “you have deserted us.” “Just temporarily,” I said. “We’re talking bulls.”",0
9075,"“Rafael, doesn’t he look like Villalta?”  “I can’t see it,” the critic said. “Really,” Romero said in Spanish. “He looks a lot like Villalta. What does the drunken one do?”  “Nothing.”  “Is that why he drinks?”  “No.",0
9084,"“I started to tell him,” Mike began. “And Jake kept interrupting me. Why do you interrupt me? Do you think you talk Spanish better than I do?”  “Oh, shut up, Mike!",0
9086,"“Oh, cut it out, Mike,” Cohn said. “Do you think Brett wants you here? Do you think you add to the party? Why don’t you say something?”  “I said all I had to say the other night, Mike.”",0
9087,"“I’m not one of you literary chaps.” Mike stood shakily and leaned against the table. “I’m not clever. But I do know when I’m not wanted. Why don’t you see when you’re not wanted, Cohn? Go away. Go away, for God’s sake. Take that sad Jewish face away. Don’t you think I’m right?”  He looked at us.",0
9089,"“Oh, don’t start that again. Do shove it along, Michael,” Brett said. “Don’t you think I’m right, Jake?”  Cohn still sat at the table.",0
9095,"Outside on the square it had stopped raining and the moon was trying to get through the clouds. There was a wind blowing. The military band was playing and the crowd was massed on the far side of the square where the fireworks specialist and his son were trying to send up fire balloons. A balloon would start up jerkily, on a great bias, and be torn by the wind or blown against the houses of the square. Some fell into the crowd. The magnesium flared and the fireworks exploded and chased about in the crowd. There was no one dancing in the square. The gravel was too wet.",0
9097,"“They’re razzing Don Manuel,” Bill said. “How do you know he’s Don Manuel?” Brett said.",0
9098,"“His name’s on the programme. Don Manuel Orquito, the pirotecnico of esta ciudad.”  “Globos illuminados,” Mike said. “A collection of globos illuminados. That’s what the paper said.”",0
9099,"The wind blew the band music away. “I say, I wish one would go up,” Brett said. “That Don Manuel chap is furious.”",0
9107,"“I’ll festa them,” Bill said. “You’re an extraordinarily beautiful girl.” Mike turned to Bill’s friend. “When did you come here?”  “Come off it, Michael.”",0
9116,"“I know.” “Nobody else would behave as badly. Oh, I’m so sick of the whole thing. And Michael. Michael’s been lovely, too.”",0
9123,"We each drank a glass of the smooth amontillado brandy. “Come on,” said Brett. As we came out the door I saw Cohn walk out from under the arcade.",0
9124,"“He was there,” Brett said. “He can’t be away from you.”  “Poor devil!” “I’m not sorry for him. I hate him, myself.”",0
9125,"“I hate him, too,” she shivered. “I hate his damned suffering.” We walked arm in arm down the side street away from the crowd and the lights of the square. The street was dark and wet, and we walked along it to the fortifications at the edge of town. We passed wine-shops with light coming out from their doors onto the black, wet street, and sudden bursts of music.",0
9126,"“Want to go in?”  “No.”  We walked out across the wet grass and onto the stone wall of the fortifications. I spread a newspaper on the stone and Brett sat down. Across the plain it was dark, and we could see the mountains. The wind was high up and took the clouds across the moon. Below us were the dark pits of the fortifications. Behind were the trees and the shadow of the cathedral, and the town silhouetted against the moon.",0
9135,"“I’m like that all through.” “You oughtn’t to do it.” “I can’t help it. I’m a goner now, anyway. Don’t you see the difference?”  “No.”  “I’ve got to do something.",0
9141,“Ask him to come over and have a drink.”  “Not yet. He’ll come over.” “I can’t look at him.”,0
9143,"“I do feel such a bitch.” “Well,” I said. “My God!” said Brett, “the things a woman goes through.”  “Yes?”  “Oh, I do feel such a bitch.”",0
9146,"“You like cigars?” I asked. “Oh, yes. I always smoke cigars.”",0
9147,"It was part of his system of authority. It made him seem older. I noticed his skin. It was clear and smooth and very brown. There was a triangular scar on his cheek-bone. I saw he was watching Brett. He felt there was something between them. He must have felt it when Brett gave him her hand. He was being very careful. I think he was sure, but he did not want to make any mistake.",0
9154,"“It’s a good hand,” Brett said. “I think he’ll live a long time.” “Say it to me. Not to your friend.”",0
9158,"“You kill your friends?” she asked. “Always,” he said in English, and laughed. “So they don’t kill me.” He looked at her across the table.",0
9163,“Good. I’ll get you one.” “Right. See that you do.”,0
9174,"“Are you a bankrupt?”  “Of course I am. You don’t care, do you, Bill?” Bill put his arm around Mike’s shoulder.",0
9179,"“They can’t say things like that about Mike,” Bill said. “Do you know them?” I asked Mike.",0
9182,"“They’re simply stupid,” Edna said. “One of them’s Charley Blackman, from Chicago,” Bill said. “I was never in Chicago,” Mike said.",0
9187,“She was with you.” “She must have gone to bed.” “She’s not.”,0
9190,“Tell me where Brett is.”  “I’ll not tell you a damn thing.” “You know where she is.” “If I did I wouldn’t tell you.”,0
9191,"“Oh, go to hell, Cohn,” Mike called from the table. “Brett’s gone off with the bull-fighter chap. They’re on their honeymoon.”",0
9197,"“You didn’t want to mix in it?”  “He knocked Mike down, too,” Edna said. “He didn’t knock me out,” Mike said. “I just lay there.”",0
9211,They were sitting at the table. I looked back at them and at the empty tables. There was a waiter sitting at one of the tables with his head in his hands.,0
9215,"Go on up and see Cohn. He’s in bad shape.” “You were drunk a little while ago,” I said.",0
9216,"“I’m drunk now,” Bill said. “But you go up and see Cohn. He wants to see you.”",0
9223,"“Oh, that’s all right.” “I couldn’t stand it about Brett.” “You called me a pimp.”",0
9226,“That’s all right.” He was crying. His voice was funny. He lay there in his white shirt on the bed in the dark. His polo shirt.,0
9228,"He lay there on the bed. “Well,” I said, “I’m going to take a bath.” “You were the only friend I had, and I loved Brett so.”",0
9230,"“It’s all right.” “I felt so terribly. I’ve been through such hell, Jake. Now everything’s gone. Everything.”  “Well,” I said, “so long.",0
9232,"Why not?”  We shook hands. In the dark I could not see his face very well. “Well,” I said, “see you in the morning.”",0
9234,"“Are you all right, Jake?” he asked. “Oh, yes,” I said. “I’m all right.”",0
9235,I could not find the bathroom. After a while I found it. There was a deep stone tub. I turned on the taps and the water would not run. I sat down on the edge of the bath-tub. When I got up to go I found I had taken off my shoes. I hunted for them and found them and carried them down-stairs. I found my room and went inside and undressed and got into bed.,0
9240,Back in the town I went to the café to have a second coffee and some buttered toast. The waiters were sweeping out the café and mopping off the tables. One came over and took my order.,0
9241,“Anything happen at the encierro?”  “I didn’t see it all. One man was badly cogido.” “Where?”  “Here.”,0
9249,“You hear? Muerto. Dead. He’s dead. With a horn through him. All for morning fun. Es muy flamenco.”,0
9251,"The bull who killed Vicente Girones was named Bocanegra, was Number 118 of the bull-breeding establishment of Sanchez Tabemo, and was killed by Pedro Romero as the third bull of that same afternoon. His ear was cut by popular acclamation and given to Pedro Romero, who, in turn, gave it to Brett, who wrapped it in a handkerchief belonging to myself, and left both ear and handkerchief, along with a number of Muratti cigarette-stubs, shoved far back in the drawer of the bed-table that stood beside her bed in the Hotel Montoya, in Pamplona. Back in the hotel, the night watchman was sitting on a bench inside the door. He had been there all night and was very sleepy. He stood up as I came in. Three of the waitresses came in at the same time. They had been to the morning show at the bull-ring. They went up-stairs laughing. I followed them up-stairs and went into my room. I took off my shoes and lay down on the bed. The window was open onto the balcony and the sunlight was bright in the room. I did not feel sleepy. It must have been half past three o’clock when I had gone to bed and the bands had waked me at six. My jaw was sore on both sides. I felt it with my thumb and fingers. That damn Cohn. He should have hit somebody the first time he was insulted, and then gone away. He was so sure that Brett loved him. He was going to stay, and true love would conquer all. Some one knocked on the door.",0
9253,"“Some encierro,” Bill said. “Some encierro.”  “I say, weren’t you there?” Mike asked. “Ring for some beer, Bill.”  “What a morning!”",0
9259,"“The steers took them in, in the end,” Mike said. “It took about an hour.” “It was really about a quarter of an hour,” Mike objected.",0
9273,"“I’ll bet she was,” Bill said. “Then Cohn broke down and cried, and wanted to shake hands with the bull-fighter fellow. He wanted to shake hands with Brett, too.”",0
9288,He smiled. “We go too long without sleep in these fiestas. I’m going to start now and get plenty of sleep. Damn bad thing not to get sleep. Makes you frightfully nervy.”,0
9289,"“We’ll see you at noon at the Iruña,” Bill said. Mike went out the door. We heard him in the next room.",0
9294,"Just badly hurt.” “A man was killed outside in the runway.”  “Was there?” said Bill. CHAPTER 18 At noon we were all at the café. It was crowded. We were eating shrimps and drinking beer. The town was crowded. Every street was full. Big motor-cars from Biarritz and San Sebastian kept driving up and parking around the square. They brought people for the bull-fight. Sight-seeing cars came up, too. There was one with twenty-five Englishwomen in it. They sat in the big, white car and looked through their glasses at the fiesta. The dancers were all quite drunk. It was the last day of the fiesta.",0
9310,"“I feel altogether changed,” Brett said. “You’ve no idea, Jake.”  “Anything you want me to do?”  “No, just go to the fight with me.” “We’ll see you at lunch?”  “No.",0
9313,"We walked along past the theatre and out of the square and along through the barracks of the fair, moving with the crowd between the lines of booths. We came out on a cross-street that led to the Paseo de Sarasate. We could see the crowd walking there, all the fashionably dressed people. They were making the turn at the upper end of the park.",0
9319,"Outside in the hot brightness of the street Brett looked up at the tree-tops in the wind. The praying had not been much of a success. “Don’t know why I get so nervy in church,” Brett said. “Never does me any good.”",0
9320,"We walked along. “I’m damned bad for a religious atmosphere,” Brett said. “I’ve the wrong type of face.",0
9325,"It was the first time I had seen her in the old happy, careless way since before she went off with Cohn. We were back again in front of the hotel. All the tables were set now, and already several were filled with people eating.",0
9326,"“Do look after Mike,” Brett said. “Don’t let him get too bad.” “Your frients haff gone up-stairs,” the German maître d’hôtel said in English. He was a continual eavesdropper. Brett turned to him:  “Thank you, so much.",0
9327,"Have you anything else to say?”  “No, ma’am.”  “Good,” said Brett. “Save us a table for three,” I said to the German. He smiled his dirty little pink-and-white smile.",0
9332,“No. I’m quite warm.”  “Don’t go. I have n’t got ten to sleep yet.”,0
9335,I’m go ing to get a lit tle sleep.” He shut his eyes. I went out of the room and turned the door to quietly. Bill was in my room reading the paper.,0
9336,“See Mike?”  “Yes.”  “Let’s go and eat.” “I won’t eat down-stairs with that German head waiter. He was damned snotty when I was getting Mike up-stairs.”,0
9338,"“There goes Brett’s lunch,” Bill said. “And the kid’s,” I said. Outside on the terrace under the arcade the German head waiter came up. His red cheeks were shiny. He was being polite.",0
9339,"“I haff a tabul for two for you gentlemen,” he said. “Go sit at it,” Bill said. We went on out across the street.",0
9344,"“Funny,” Brett said. “How one doesn’t mind the blood.” Below in the narrow passage of the callejon the sword-handlers arranged everything. All the seats were full. Above, all the boxes were full. There was not an empty seat except in the President’s box. When he came in the fight would start. Across the smooth sand, in the high doorway that led into the corrals, the bull-fighters were standing, their arms furled in their capes, talking, waiting for the signal to march in across the arena. Brett was watching them with the glasses.",0
9346,"“Here, take them,” she said. Through the glasses I saw Belmonte speak to Romero. Marcial straightened up and dropped his cigarette, and, looking straight ahead, their heads back, their free arms swinging, the three matadors walked out. Behind them came all the procession, opening out, all striding in step, all the capes furled, everybody with free arms swinging, and behind rode the picadors, their pics rising like lances. Behind all came the two trains of mules and the bull-ring servants. The matadors bowed, holding their hats on, before the President’s box, and then came over to the barrera below us. Pedro Romero took off his heavy gold-brocaded cape and handed it over the fence to his sword-handler. He said something to the sword-handler. Close below us we saw Romero’s lips were puffed, both eyes were discolored. His face was discolored and swollen. The sword-handler took the cape, looked up at Brett, and came over to us and handed up the cape.",0
9347,"“Spread it out in front of you,” I said. Brett leaned forward. The cape was heavy and smoothly stiff with gold. The sword-handler looked back, shook his head, and said something. A man beside me leaned over toward Brett.",0
9356,"His first “quite” was directly below us. The three matadors take the bull in turn after each charge he makes at a picador. Belmonte was the first. Marcial was the second. Then came Romero. The three of them were standing at the left of the horse. The picador, his hat down over his eyes, the shaft of his pic angling sharply toward the bull, kicked in the spurs and held them and with the reins in his left hand walked the horse forward toward the bull. The bull was watching. Seemingly he watched the white horse, but really he watched the triangular steel point of the pic. Romero, watching, saw the bull start to turn his head. He did not want to charge. Romero flicked his cape so the color caught the bull’s eye. The bull charged with the reflex, charged, and found not the flash of color but a white horse, and a man leaned far over the horse, shot the steel point of the long hickory shaft into the hump of muscle on the bull’s shoulder, and pulled his horse sideways as he pivoted on the pic, making a wound, enforcing the iron into the bull’s shoulder, making him bleed for Belmonte.",0
9357,"The bull did not insist under the iron. He did not really want to get at the horse. He turned and the group broke apart and Romero was taking him out with his cape. He took him out softly and smoothly, and then stopped and, standing squarely in front of the bull, offered him the cape. The bull’s tail went up and he charged, and Romero moved his arms ahead of the bull, wheeling, his feet firmed. The dampened, mud-weighted cape swung open and full as a sail fills, and Romero pivoted with it just ahead of the bull. At the end of the pass they were facing each other again. Romero smiled. The bull wanted it again, and Romero’s cape filled again, this time on the other side. Each time he let the bull pass so close that the man and the bull and the cape that filled and pivoted ahead of the bull were all one sharply etched mass. It was all so slow and so controlled. It was as though he were rocking the bull to sleep. He made four veronicas like that, and finished with a half-veronica that turned his back on the bull and came away toward the applause, his hand on his hip, his cape on his arm, and the bull watching his back going away.",0
9361,“What’s he afraid of the bull for? The bull’s so dumb he only goes after the cloth.”  “He’s just a young bull-fighter. He hasn’t learned it yet.”,0
9364,"Out in the centre of the ring Romero profiled in front of the bull, drew the sword out from the folds of the muleta, rose on his toes, and sighted along the blade. The bull charged as Romero charged. Romero’s left hand dropped the muleta over the bull’s muzzle to blind him, his left shoulder went forward between the horns as the sword went in, and for just an instant he and the bull were one, Romero way out over the bull, the right arm extended high up to where the hilt of the sword had gone in between the bull’s shoulders. Then the figure was broken. There was a little jolt as Romero came clear, and then he was standing, one hand up, facing the bull, his shirt ripped out from under his sleeve, the white blowing in the wind, and the bull, the red sword hilt tight between his shoulders, his head going down and his legs settling.",0
9365,"“There he goes,” Bill said. Romero was close enough so the bull could see him. His hand still up, he spoke to the bull. The bull gathered himself, then his head went forward and he went over slowly, then all over, suddenly, four feet in the air.",0
9372,“You liked it?” Romero called. Brett did not say anything. They looked at each other and smiled. Brett had the ear in her hand.,0
9373,"“Don’t get bloody,” Romero said, and grinned. The crowd wanted him. Several boys shouted at Brett. The crowd was the boys, the dancers, and the drunks. Romero turned and tried to get through the crowd. They were all around him trying to lift him and put him on their shoulders. He fought and twisted away, and started running, in the midst of them, toward the exit. He did not want to be carried on people’s shoulders. But they held him and lifted him. It was uncomfortable and his legs were spraddled and his body was very sore. They were lifting him and all running toward the gate. He had his hand on somebody’s shoulder. He looked around at us apologetically. The crowd, running, went out the gate with him.",0
9376,"“Come on over to the café,” Bill said. “I want an absinthe.” It was the last day of the fiesta. Outside it was beginning to be cloudy again. The square was full of people and the fireworks experts were making up their set pieces for the night and covering them over with beech branches. Boys were watching. We passed stands of rockets with long bamboo stems. Outside the café there was a great crowd. The music and the dancing were going on. The giants and the dwarfs were passing.",0
9379,"“I feel sorry about Cohn,” Bill said. “He had an awful time.” “Oh, to hell with Cohn,” I said.",0
9391,I was very drunk. I was drunker than I ever remembered having been. At the hotel I went up-stairs. Brett’s door was open. I put my head in the room. Mike was sitting on the bed. He waved a bottle.,0
9395,“She shouldn’t have done it.” “No.”  “Have a drink? Wait while I ring for some beer.”,0
9397,"“Yes,” I said, “I’m blind.” “Well, bung-o,” Mike said. “Get some sleep, old Jake.”",0
9401,“Here he is!” said Bill. “Good old Jake! I knew you wouldn’t pass out.”,0
9402,"“Hello, you old drunk,” Mike said. “I got hungry and woke up.” “Eat some soup,” Bill said.",0
9421,“I shouldn’t think so. She put up most of what I gave to old Montoya.” “She hasn’t any money with her?” I asked.,0
9426,"“Anywhere you’d like to go, Mike?” Bill asked. “Let’s take a drive. It might do my credit good. Let’s drive about a little.”  “Fine.",0
9427,I’d like to see the coast. Let’s drive down toward Hendaye.” “I haven’t any credit along the coast.”,0
9428,"“You can’t ever tell,” said Bill. We drove out along the coast road. There was the green of the headlands, the white, red-roofed villas, patches of forest, and the ocean very blue with the tide out and the water curling far out along the beach. We drove through Saint Jean de Luz and passed through villages farther down the coast. Back of the rolling country we were going through we saw the mountains we had come over from Pamplona. The road went on ahead. Bill looked at his watch. It was time for us to go back. He knocked on the glass and told the driver to turn around. The driver backed the car out into the grass to turn it. In back of us were the woods, below a stretch of meadow, then the sea.",0
9429,At the hotel where Mike was going to stay in Saint Jean we stopped the car and he got out. The chauffeur carried in his bags. Mike stood by the side of the car.,0
9430,"“Good-bye, you chaps,” Mike said. “It was a damned fine fiesta.” “So long, Mike,” Bill said.",0
9431,"“I’ll see you around,” I said. “Don’t worry about money,” Mike said. “You can pay for the car, Jake, and I’ll send you my share.”",0
9437,"At the hotel I paid the driver and gave him a tip. The car was powdered with dust. I rubbed the rod-case through the dust. It seemed the last thing that connected me with Spain and the fiesta. The driver put the car in gear and went down the street. I watched it turn off to take the road to Spain. I went into the hotel and they gave me a room. It was the same room I had slept in when Bill and Cohn and I were in Bayonne. That seemed a very long time ago. I washed, changed my shirt, and went out in the town.",0
9438,"At a newspaper kiosque I bought a copy of the New York Herald and sat in a café to read it. It felt strange to be in France again. There was a safe, suburban feeling. I wished I had gone up to Paris with Bill, except that Paris would have meant more fiesta-ing. I was through with fiestas for a while. It would be quiet in San Sebastian. The season does not open there until August. I could get a good hotel room and read and swim. There was a fine beach there. There were wonderful trees along the promenade above the beach, and there were many children sent down with their nurses before the season opened. In the evening there would be band concerts under the trees across from the Café Marinas. I could sit in the Marinas and listen.",0
9440,“Well. Very well. One eats very well.”  “Good.”,0
9441,I went in and ate dinner. It was a big meal for France but it seemed very carefully apportioned after Spain. I drank a bottle of wine for company. It was a Château Margaux. It was pleasant to be drinking slowly and to be tasting the wine and to be drinking alone. A bottle of wine was good company. Afterward I had coffee. The waiter recommended a Basque liqueur called Izzarra. He brought in the bottle and poured a liqueur-glass full. He said Izzarra was made of the flowers of the Pyrenees. The veritable flowers of the Pyrenees. It looked like hair-oil and smelled like Italian strega. I told him to take the flowers of the Pyrenees away and bring me a vieux marc. The marc was good. I had a second marc after the coffee.,0
9442,"The waiter seemed a little offended about the flowers of the Pyrenees, so I overtipped him. That made him happy. It felt comfortable to be in a country where it is so simple to make people happy. You can never tell whether a Spanish waiter will thank you. Everything is on such a clear financial basis in France. It is the simplest country to live in. No one makes things complicated by becoming your friend for any obscure reason. If you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money. I spent a little money and the waiter liked me. He appreciated my valuable qualities. He would be glad to see me back. I would dine there again some time and he would be glad to see me, and would want me at his table. It would be a sincere liking because it would have a sound basis. I was back in France.",0
9443,"Next morning I tipped every one a little too much at the hotel to make more friends, and left on the morning train for San Sebastian. At the station I did not tip the porter more than I should because I did not think I would ever see him again. I only wanted a few good French friends in Bayonne to make me welcome in case I should come back there again. I knew that if they remembered me their friendship would be loyal.",0
9444,"At Irun we had to change trains and show passports. I hated to leave France. Life was so simple in France. I felt I was a fool to be going back into Spain. In Spain you could not tell about anything. I felt like a fool to be going back into it, but I stood in line with my passport, opened my bags for the customs, bought a ticket, went through a gate, climbed onto the train, and after forty minutes and eight tunnels I was at San Sebastian.",0
9445,"Even on a hot day San Sebastian has a certain early-morning quality. The trees seem as though their leaves were never quite dry. The streets feel as though they had just been sprinkled. It is always cool and shady on certain streets on the hottest day. I went to a hotel in the town where I had stopped before, and they gave me a room with a balcony that opened out above the roofs of the town. There was a green mountainside beyond the roofs.",0
9450,"Later when it began to get dark, I walked around the harbor and out along the promenade, and finally back to the hotel for supper. There was a bicycle-race on, the Tour du Pays Basque, and the riders were stopping that night in San Sebastian. In the dining-room, at one side, there was a long table of bicycle-riders, eating with their trainers and managers. They were all French and Belgians, and paid close attention to their meal, but they were having a good time. At the head of the table were two good-looking French girls, with much Rue du Faubourg Montmartre chic. I could not make out whom they belonged to. They all spoke in slang at the long table and there were many private jokes and some jokes at the far end that were not repeated when the girls asked to hear them. The next morning at five o’clock the race resumed with the last lap, San Sebastian-Bilbao. The bicycle-riders drank much wine, and were burned and browned by the sun. They did not take the race seriously except among themselves. They had raced among themselves so often that it did not make much difference who won. Especially in a foreign country. The money could be arranged.",0
9452,"“Listen,” he said, “to-morrow my nose is so tight on the handle-bars that the only thing touches those boils is a lovely breeze.”  One of the girls looked at him down the table, and he grinned and turned red. The Spaniards, they said, did not know how to pedal. I had coffee out on the terrasse with the team manager of one of the big bicycle manufacturers. He said it had been a very pleasant race, and would have been worth watching if Bottechia had not abandoned it at Pamplona. The dust had been bad, but in Spain the roads were better than in France. Bicycle road-racing was the only sport in the world, he said. Had I ever followed the Tour de France? Only in the papers. The Tour de France was the greatest sporting event in the world. Following and organizing the road races had made him know France. Few people know France. All spring and all summer and all fall he spent on the road with bicycle road-racers. Look at the number of motor-cars now that followed the riders from town to town in a road race. It was a rich country and more sportif every year. It would be the most sportif country in the world. It was bicycle road-racing did it. That and football. He knew France. La France Sportive. He knew road-racing. We had a cognac. After all, though, it wasn’t bad to get back to Paris. There is only one Paname. In all the world, that is. Paris is the town the most sportif in the world. Did I know the Chope de Negre? Did I not. I would see him there some time. I certainly would. We would drink another fine together. We certainly would. They started at six o’clock less a quarter in the morning. Would I be up for the depart? I would certainly try to. Would I like him to call me? It was very interesting. I would leave a call at the desk. He would not mind calling me. I could not let him take the trouble. I would leave a call at the desk. We said good-bye until the next morning.",0
9455,"I sat in the sun and watched the bathers on the beach. They looked very small. After a while I stood up, gripped with my toes on the edge of the raft as it tipped with my weight, and dove cleanly and deeply, to come up through the lightening water, blew the salt water out of my head, and swam slowly and steadily in to shore.",0
9456,"After I was dressed and had paid for the bath-cabin, I walked back to the hotel. The bicycle-racers had left several copies of L’Auto around, and I gathered them up in the reading-room and took them out and sat in an easy chair in the sun to read about and catch up on French sporting life. While I was sitting there the concierge came out with a blue envelope in his hand.",0
9458,I tipped the concierge and read the message again. A postman was coming along the sidewalk. He turned in the hotel. He had a big moustache and looked very military. He came out of the hotel again. The concierge was just behind him.,0
9459,"“Here’s another telegram for you, sir.”  “Thank you,” I said. I opened it. It was forwarded from Pamplona.",0
9464,"I did not sleep much that night on the Sud Express. In the morning I had breakfast in the dining-car and watched the rock and pine country between Avila and Escorial. I saw the Escorial out of the window, gray and long and cold in the sun, and did not give a damn about it. I saw Madrid come up over the plain, a compact white sky-line on the top of a little cliff away off across the sun-hardened country.",0
9469,"“Muy buenos. Yes, there is a female English. Certainly you can see her if she wishes to see you.”",0
9494,She looked away. I thought she was looking for another cigarette. Then I saw she was crying. I could feel her crying. Shaking and crying. She wouldn’t look up. I put my arms around her.,0
9495,“Don’t let’s ever talk about it. Please don’t let’s ever talk about it.” “Dear Brett.”  “I’m going back to Mike.”,0
9499,"“Oh, well. Let it go,” Brett said. “It doesn’t matter now.”",0
9508,"“Bung-o!”  “You know,” Brett said, “he’d only been with two women before. He never cared about anything but bull-fighting.” “He’s got plenty of time.”",0
9517,"“I feel fine. Do you want a dessert?”  “Lord, no.”  Brett was smoking. “You like to eat, don’t you?” she said.",0
9519,"“What do you like to do?”  “Oh,” I said, “I like to do a lot of things. Don’t you want a dessert?”  “You asked me that once,” Brett said. “Yes,” I said. “So I did. Let’s have another bottle of rioja alta.”",0
9524,"“You’ll be all right.” “I’m not getting drunk,” I said. “I’m just drinking a little wine. I like to drink wine.”  “Don’t get drunk,” she said.",0
9527,"Down-stairs we came out through the first-floor dining-room to the street. A waiter went for a taxi. It was hot and bright. Up the street was a little square with trees and grass where there were taxis parked. A taxi came up the street, the waiter hanging out at the side. I tipped him and told the driver where to drive, and got in beside Brett. The driver started up the street. I settled back. Brett moved close to me. We sat close against each other. I put my arm around her and she rested against me comfortably. It was very hot and bright, and the houses looked sharply white. We turned out onto the Gran Via.",0
9528,"“Oh, Jake,” Brett said, “we could have had such a damned good time together.” Ahead was a mounted policeman in khaki directing traffic. He raised his baton. The car slowed suddenly pressing Brett against me.",0
