0,"TO THE READER This is a first book, and in it the author has written of experience which is now far and lost, but which was once part of the fabric of his life. If any reader, therefore, should say that the book is ""autobiographical"" the writer has no answer for him: it seems to him that all serious work in fiction is autobiographical-- that, for instance, a more autobiographical work than ""Gulliver's Travels"" cannot easily be imagined.",1
1,"This note, however, is addressed principally to those persons whom the writer may have known in the period covered by these pages. To these persons, he would say what he believes they understand already: that this book was written in innocence and nakedness of spirit, and that the writer's main concern was to give fulness, life, and intensity to the actions and people in the book he was creating. Now that it is to be published, he would insist that this book is a fiction, and that he meditated no man's portrait here.",1
2,"But we are the sum of all the moments of our lives--all that is ours is in them: we cannot escape or conceal it. If the writer has used the clay of life to make his book, he has only used what all men must, what none can keep from using. Fiction is not fact, but fiction is fact selected and understood, fiction is fact arranged and charged with purpose. Dr. Johnson remarked that a man would turn over half a library to make a single book: in the same way, a novelist may turn over half the people in a town to make a single figure in his novel. This is not the whole method but the writer believes it illustrates the whole method in a book that is written from a middle distance and is without rancour or bitter intention.",1
3,"LOOK HOMEWARD, ANGEL    PART ONE   . . . a stone, a leaf, an unfound door; of a stone, a leaf, a door. And of all the forgotten faces.",1
4,Naked and alone we came into exile. In her dark womb we did not know our mother's face; from the prison of her flesh have we come into the unspeakable and incommunicable prison of this earth. Which of us has known his brother? Which of us has looked into his father's heart? Which of us has not remained forever prison-pent? Which of us is not forever a stranger and alone?,1
5,"O waste of loss, in the hot mazes, lost, among bright stars on this most weary unbright cinder, lost! Remembering speechlessly we seek the great forgotten language, the lost lane-end into heaven, a stone, a leaf, an unfound door. Where? When?  O lost, and by the wind grieved, ghost, come back again.",1
6,"1   A destiny that leads the English to the Dutch is strange enough; but one that leads from Epsom into Pennsylvania, and thence into the hills that shut in Altamont over the proud coral cry of the cock, and the soft stone smile of an angel, is touched by that dark miracle of chance which makes new magic in a dusty world. Each of us is all the sums he has not counted: subtract us into nakedness and night again, and you shall see begin in Crete four thousand years ago the love that ended yesterday in Texas.",1
7,"The seed of our destruction will blossom in the desert, the alexin of our cure grows by a mountain rock, and our lives are haunted by a Georgia slattern, because a London cut-purse went unhung. Each moment is the fruit of forty thousand years. The minute-winning days, like flies, buzz home to death, and every moment is a window on all time.",1
8,"This is a moment:  An Englishman named Gilbert Gaunt, which he later changed to Gant (a concession probably to Yankee phonetics), having come to Baltimore from Bristol in 1837 on a sailing vessel, soon let the profits of a public house which he had purchased roll down his improvident gullet. He wandered westward into Pennsylvania, eking out a dangerous living by matching fighting cocks against the champions of country barnyards, and often escaping after a night spent in a village jail, with his champion dead on the field of battle, without the clink of a coin in his pocket, and sometimes with the print of a farmer's big knuckles on his reckless face. But he always escaped, and coming at length among the Dutch at harvest time he was so touched by the plenty of their land that he cast out his anchors there. Within a year he married a rugged young widow with a tidy farm who like all the other Dutch had been charmed by his air of travel, and his grandiose speech, particularly when he did Hamlet in the manner of the great Edmund Kean. Every one said he should have been an actor.",1
9,"The Englishman begot children--a daughter and four sons--lived easily and carelessly, and bore patiently the weight of his wife's harsh but honest tongue. The years passed, his bright somewhat staring eyes grew dull and bagged, the tall Englishman walked with a gouty shuffle: one morning when she came to nag him out of sleep she found him dead of an apoplexy. He left five children, a mortgage and--in his strange dark eyes which now stared bright and open--something that had not died: a passionate and obscure hunger for voyages.",1
10,"So, with this legacy, we leave this Englishman and are concerned hereafter with the heir to whom he bequeathed it, his second son, a boy named Oliver. How this boy stood by the roadside near his mother's farm, and saw the dusty Rebels march past on their way to Gettysburg, how his cold eyes darkened when he heard the great name of Virginia, and how the year the war had ended, when he was still fifteen, he had walked along a street in Baltimore, and seen within a little shop smooth granite slabs of death, carved lambs and cherubim, and an angel poised upon cold phthisic feet, with a smile of soft stone idiocy--this is a longer tale. But I know that his cold and shallow eyes had darkened with the obscure and passionate hunger that had lived in a dead man's eyes, and that had led from Fenchurch Street past Philadelphia. As the boy looked at the big angel with the carved stipe of lilystalk, a cold and nameless excitement possessed him. The long fingers of his big hands closed. He felt that he wanted, more than anything in the world, to carve delicately with a chisel. He wanted to wreak something dark and unspeakable in him into cold stone. He wanted to carve an angel's head.",1
11,Oliver entered the shop and asked a big bearded man with a wooden mallet for a job. He became the stone cutter's apprentice. He worked in that dusty yard five years. He became a stone cutter. When his apprenticeship was over he had become a man.,1
12,"He never found it. He never learned to carve an angel's head. The dove, the lamb, the smooth joined marble hands of death, and letters fair and fine--but not the angel. And of all the years of waste and loss--the riotous years in Baltimore, of work and savage drunkenness, and the theatre of Booth and Salvini, which had a disastrous effect upon the stone cutter, who memorized each accent of the noble rant, and strode muttering through the streets, with rapid gestures of the enormous talking hands--these are blind steps and gropings of our exile, the painting of our hunger as, remembering speechlessly, we seek the great forgotten language, the lost lane-end into heaven, a stone, a leaf, a door. Where? When?  He never found it, and he reeled down across the continent into the Reconstruction South--a strange wild form of six feet four with cold uneasy eyes, a great blade of nose, and a rolling tide of rhetoric, a preposterous and comic invective, as formalized as classical epithet, which he used seriously, but with a faint uneasy grin around the corners of his thin wailing mouth.",1
13,"He set up business in Sydney, the little capital city of one of the middle Southern states, lived soberly and industriously under the attentive eye of a folk still raw with defeat and hostility, and finally, his good name founded and admission won, he married a gaunt tubercular spinstress, ten years his elder, but with a nest egg and an unshakable will to matrimony. Within eighteen months he was a howling maniac again, his little business went smash while his foot stayed on the polished rail, and Cynthia, his wife--whose life, the natives said, he had not helped to prolong--died suddenly one night after a hemorrhage. So, all was gone again--Cynthia, the shop, the hard-bought praise of soberness, the angel's head--he walked through the streets at dark, yelling his pentameter curse at Rebel ways, and all their indolence; but sick with fear and loss and penitence, he wilted under the town's reproving stare, becoming convinced, as the flesh wasted on his own gaunt frame, that Cynthia's scourge was doing vengeance now on him.",1
14,"He was only past thirty, but he looked much older. His face was yellow and sunken; the waxen blade of his nose looked like a beak. He had long brown mustaches that hung straight down mournfully.",1
15,"His tremendous bouts of drinking had wrecked his health. He was thin as a rail and had a cough. He thought of Cynthia now, in the lonely and hostile town, and he became afraid. He thought he had tuberculosis and that he was going to die.",1
16,"So, alone and lost again, having found neither order nor establishment in the world, and with the earth cut away from his feet, Oliver resumed his aimless drift along the continent. He turned westward toward the great fortress of the hills, knowing that behind them his evil fame would not be known, and hoping that he might find in them isolation, a new life, and recovered health. The eyes of the gaunt spectre darkened again, as they had in his youth.",1
17,"All day, under a wet gray sky of October, Oliver rode westward across the mighty state. As he stared mournfully out the window at the great raw land so sparsely tilled by the futile and occasional little farms, which seemed to have made only little grubbing patches in the wilderness, his heart went cold and leaden in him. He thought of the great barns of Pennsylvania, the ripe bending of golden grain, the plenty, the order, the clean thrift of the people. And he thought of how he had set out to get order and position for himself, and of the rioting confusion of his life, the blot and blur of years, and the red waste of his youth.",1
18,By God! he thought. I'm getting old! Why here?,1
19,"The grisly parade of the spectre years trooped through his brain. Suddenly, he saw that his life had been channelled by a series of accidents: a mad Rebel singing of Armageddon, the sound of a bugle on the road, the mule-hoofs of the army, the silly white face of an angel in a dusty shop, a slut's pert wiggle of her hams as she passed by. He had reeled out of warmth and plenty into this barren land: as he stared out the window and saw the fallow unworked earth, the great raw lift of the Piedmont, the muddy red clay roads, and the slattern people gaping at the stations--a lean farmer gangling above his reins, a dawdling negro, a gap-toothed yokel, a hard sallow woman with a grimy baby--the strangeness of destiny stabbed him with fear. How came he here from the clean Dutch thrift of his youth into this vast lost earth of rickets?",1
20,The train rattled on over the reeking earth. Rain fell steadily. A brakeman came draftily into the dirty plush coach and emptied a scuttle of coal into the big stove at the end. High empty laughter shook a group of yokels sprawled on two turned seats. The bell tolled mournfully above the clacking wheels. There was a droning interminable wait at a junction-town near the foot-hills. Then the train moved on again across the vast rolling earth.,1
21,"Dusk came. The huge bulk of the hills was foggily emergent. Small smoky lights went up in the hillside shacks. The train crawled dizzily across high trestles spanning ghostly hawsers of water. Far up, far down, plumed with wisps of smoke, toy cabins stuck to bank and gulch and hillside. The train toiled sinuously up among gouged red cuts with slow labor. As darkness came, Oliver descended at the little town of Old Stockade where the rails ended. The last great wall of the hills lay stark above him. As he left the dreary little station and stared into the greasy lamplight of a country store, Oliver felt that he was crawling, like a great beast, into the circle of those enormous hills to die.",1
22,"The next morning he resumed his journey by coach. His destination was the little town of Altamont, twenty-four miles away beyond the rim of the great outer wall of the hills. As the horses strained slowly up the mountain road Oliver's spirit lifted a little. It was a gray-golden day in late October, bright and windy. There was a sharp bite and sparkle in the mountain air: the range soared above him, close, immense, clean, and barren. The trees rose gaunt and stark: they were almost leafless. The sky was full of windy white rags of cloud; a thick blade of mist washed slowly around the rampart of a mountain.",1
23,"Below him a mountain stream foamed down its rocky bed, and he could see little dots of men laying the track that would coil across the hill toward Altamont. Then the sweating team lipped the gulch of the mountain, and, among soaring and lordly ranges that melted away in purple mist, they began the slow descent toward the high plateau on which the town of Altamont was built. In the haunting eternity of these mountains, rimmed in their enormous cup, he found sprawled out on its hundred hills and hollows a town of four thousand people.",1
24,"There were new lands. His heart lifted. This town of Altamont had been settled soon after the Revolutionary War. It had been a convenient stopping-off place for cattledrovers and farmers in their swing eastward from Tennessee into South Carolina. And, for several decades before the Civil War, it had enjoyed the summer patronage of fashionable people from Charleston and the plantations of the hot South. When Oliver first came to it it had begun to get some reputation not only as a summer resort, but as a sanitarium for tuberculars. Several rich men from the North had established hunting lodges in the hills, and one of them had bought huge areas of mountain land and, with an army of imported architects, carpenters and masons, was planning the greatest country estate in America--something in limestone, with pitched slate roofs, and one hundred and eighty-three rooms. It was modelled on the chateau at Blois. There was also a vast new hotel, a sumptuous wooden barn, rambling comfortably upon the summit of a commanding hill.",1
25,"But most of the population was still native, recruited from the hill and country people in the surrounding districts. They were Scotch-Irish mountaineers, rugged, provincial, intelligent, and industrious. Oliver had about twelve hundred dollars saved from the wreckage of Cynthia's estate. During the winter he rented a little shack at one edge of the town's public square, acquired a small stock of marbles, and set up business. But he had little to do at first save to think of the prospect of his death. During the bitter and lonely winter, while he thought he was dying, the gaunt scarecrow Yankee that flapped muttering through the streets became an object of familiar gossip to the townspeople. All the people at his boarding-house knew that at night he walked his room with great caged strides, and that a long low moan that seemed wrung from his bowels quivered incessantly on his thin lips. But he spoke to no one about it.",1
26,"And then the marvellous hill Spring came, green-golden, with brief spurting winds, the magic and fragrance of the blossoms, warm gusts of balsam. The great wound in Oliver began to heal. His voice was heard in the land once more, there were purple flashes of the old rhetoric, the ghost of the old eagerness.",1
27,"One day in April, as with fresh awakened senses, he stood before his shop, watching the flurry of life in the square, Oliver heard behind him the voice of a man who was passing. And that voice, flat, drawling, complacent, touched with sudden light a picture that had lain dead in him for twenty years. Hit's a comin'!  Accordin' to my figgers hit's due June 11, 1886. Oliver turned and saw retreating the burly persuasive figure of the prophet he had last seen vanishing down the dusty road that led to Gettysburg and Armageddon.",1
28,Who is that? he asked a man. The man looked and grinned.,1
29,"That's Bacchus Pentland,"" he said. He's quite a character. There are a lot of his folks around here. Oliver wet his great thumb briefly.",1
30,"Then, with a grin, he said:  ""Has Armageddon come yet?""  ""He's expecting it any day now,"" said the man. Then Oliver met Eliza. He lay one afternoon in Spring upon the smooth leather sofa of his little office, listening to the bright piping noises in the Square. A restoring peace brooded over his great extended body. He thought of the loamy black earth with its sudden young light of flowers, of the beaded chill of beer, and of the plumtree's dropping blossoms. Then he heard the brisk heel- taps of a woman coming down among the marbles, and he got hastily to his feet. He was drawing on his well brushed coat of heavy black just as she entered.",1
31,"I tell you what,"" said Eliza, pursing her lips in reproachful banter, ""I wish I was a man and had nothing to do but lie around all day on a good easy sofa. Good afternoon, madam,"" said Oliver with a flourishing bow. Yes,"" he said, as a faint sly grin bent the corners of his thin mouth, ""I reckon you've caught me taking my constitutional. As a matter of fact I very rarely lie down in the daytime, but I've been in bad health for the last year now, and I'm not able to do the work I used to. He was silent a moment; his face drooped in an expression of hangdog dejection.",1
32,"Ah, Lord! I don't know what's to become of me!""  ""Pshaw!"" said Eliza briskly and contemptuously. There's nothing wrong with you in my opinion. You're a big strapping fellow, in the prime of life. Half of it's only imagination. Most of the time we think we're sick it's all in the mind. I remember three years ago I was teaching school in Hominy Township when I was taken down with pneumonia. Nobody ever expected to see me come out of it alive but I got through it somehow; I well remember one day I was sitting down--as the fellow says, I reckon I was convalescin'; the reason I remember is Old Doctor Fletcher had just been and when he went out I saw him shake his head at my cousin Sally. 'Why Eliza, what on earth,' she said, just as soon as he had gone, 'he tells me you're spitting up blood every time you cough; you've got consumption as sure as you live.' 'Pshaw,' I said. I remember I laughed just as big as you please, determined to make a big joke of it all; I just thought to myself, I'm not going to give into it, I'll fool them all yet; 'I don't believe a word of it' (I said),"" she nodded her head smartly at him, and pursed her lips, ""'and besides, Sally' (I said) 'we've all got to go some time, and there's no use worrying about what's going to happen. It may come tomorrow, or it may come later, but it's bound to come to all in the end'. Ah Lord!"" said Oliver, shaking his head sadly.",1
33,You bit the nail on the head that time. A truer word was never spoken. Merciful God!,1
34,"he thought, with an anguished inner grin. How long is this to keep up? But she's a pippin as sure as you're born. He looked appreciatively at her trim erect figure, noting her milky white skin, her black-brown eyes, with their quaint child's stare, and her jet black hair drawn back tightly from her high white forehead. She had a curious trick of pursing her lips reflectively before she spoke; she liked to take her time, and came to the point after interminable divagations down all the lane-ends of memory and overtone, feasting upon the golden pageant of all she had ever said, done, felt, thought, seen, or replied, with egocentric delight. Then, while he looked, she ceased speaking abruptly, put her neat gloved hand to her chin, and stared off with a thoughtful pursed mouth.",1
35,"Well,"" she said after a moment, ""if you're getting your health back and spend a good part of your time lying around you ought to have something to occupy your mind. She opened a leather portmanteau she was carrying and produced a visiting card and two fat volumes. My name,"" she said portentously, with slow emphasis, ""is Eliza Pentland, and I represent the Larkin Publishing Company. She spoke the words proudly, with dignified gusto.",1
36,"Merciful God! A book agent! thought Gant. We are offering,"" said Eliza, opening a huge yellow book with a fancy design of spears and flags and laurel wreaths, ""a book of poems called Gems of Verse for Hearth and Fireside as well as Larkin's Domestic Doctor and Book of Household Remedies, giving directions for the cure and prevention of over five hundred diseases. Well,"" said Gant, with a faint grin, wetting his big thumb briefly, ""I ought to find one that I've got out of that.",1
37,"Why, yes,"" said Eliza, nodding smartly, ""as the fellow says, you can read poetry for the good of your soul and Larkin for the good of your body. I like poetry,"" said Gant, thumbing over the pages, and pausing with interest at the section marked Songs of the Spur and Sabre. In my boyhood I could recite it by the hour. He bought the books.",1
38,"Eliza packed her samples, and stood up looking sharply and curiously about the dusty little shop. Doing any business?"" she said. Very little,"" said Oliver sadly. Hardly enough to keep body and soul together. I'm a stranger in a strange land. Pshaw!"" said Eliza cheerfully.",1
39,"You ought to get out and meet more people. You need something to take your mind off yourself. If I were you, I'd pitch right in and take an interest in the town's progress. We've got everything here it takes to make a big town--scenery, climate, and natural resources, and we all ought to work together. If I had a few thousand dollars I know what I'd do,""--she winked smartly at him, and began to speak with a curiously masculine gesture of the hand--forefinger extended, fist loosely clenched. Do you see this corner here--the one you're on? It'll double in value in the next few years. Now, here! she gestured before her with the loose masculine gesture. They're going to run a street through there some day as sure as you live. And when they do--"" she pursed her lips reflectively, ""that property is going to be worth money. She continued to talk about property with a strange meditative hunger.",1
40,"The town seemed to be an enormous blueprint to her: her head was stuffed uncannily with figures and estimates--who owned a lot, who sold it, the sale-price, the real value, the future value, first and second mortgages, and so on. When she had finished, Oliver said with the emphasis of strong aversion, thinking of Sydney:  ""I hope I never own another piece of property as long as I live-- save a house to live in. It is nothing but a curse and a care, and the tax-collector gets it all in the end. Eliza looked at him with a startled expression, as if he had uttered a damnable heresy.",1
41,"Why, say! That's no way to talk! she said. You want to lay something by for a rainy day, don't you?""  ""I'm having my rainy day now,"" he said gloomily.",1
42,"All the property I need is eight feet of earth to be buried in. Then, talking more cheerfully, he walked with her to the door of the shop, and watched her as she marched primly away across the square, holding her skirts at the curbs with ladylike nicety. Then he turned back among his marbles again with a stirring in him of a joy he thought he had lost forever.",1
43,"The Pentland family, of which Eliza was a member, was one of the strangest tribes that ever came out of the hills. It had no clear title to the name of Pentland: a Scotch-Englishman of that name, who was a mining engineer, the grandfather of the present head of the family, had come into the hills after the Revolution, looking for copper, and lived there for several years, begetting several children by one of the pioneer women. When he disappeared the woman took for herself and her children the name of Pentland.",1
44,"The present chieftain of the tribe was Eliza's father, the brother of the prophet Bacchus, Major Thomas Pentland. Another brother had been killed during the Seven Days. Major Pentland's military title was honestly if inconspicuously earned. While Bacchus, who never rose above the rank of Corporal, was blistering his hard hands at Shiloh, the Major, as commander of two companies of Home Volunteers, was guarding the stronghold of the native hills. This stronghold was never threatened until the closing days of the war, when the Volunteers, ambuscaded behind convenient trees and rocks, fired three volleys into a detachment of Sherman's stragglers, and quietly dispersed to the defense of their attendant wives and children.",1
45,"The Pentland family was as old as any in the community, but it had always been poor, and had made few pretenses to gentility. By marriage, and by intermarriage among its own kinsmen, it could boast of some connection with the great, of some insanity, and a modicum of idiocy. But because of its obvious superiority, in intelligence and fibre, to most of the mountain people it held a position of solid respect among them.",1
46,"The Pentlands bore a strong clan-marking. Like most rich personalities in strange families their powerful group-stamp became more impressive because of their differences. They had broad powerful noses, with fleshy deeply scalloped wings, sensual mouths, extraordinarily mixed of delicacy and coarseness, which in the process of thinking they convolved with astonishing flexibility, broad intelligent foreheads, and deep flat cheeks, a trifle hollowed. The men were generally ruddy of face, and their typical stature was meaty, strong, and of middling height, although it varied into gangling cadaverousness.",1
47,"Major Thomas Pentland was the father of a numerous family of which Eliza was the only surviving girl. A younger sister had died a few years before of a disease which the family identified sorrowfully as ""poor Jane's scrofula. There were six boys:  Henry, the oldest, was now thirty, Will was twenty-six, Jim was twenty-two, and Thaddeus, Elmer and Greeley were, in the order named, eighteen, fifteen, and eleven. Eliza was twenty-four.",1
48,"The four oldest children, Henry, Will, Eliza, and Jim, had passed their childhood in the years following the war. The poverty and privation of these years had been so terrible that none of them ever spoke of it now, but the bitter steel had sheared into their hearts, leaving scars that would not heal. The effect of these years upon the oldest children was to develop in them an insane niggardliness, an insatiate love of property, and a desire to escape from the Major's household as quickly as possible.",1
49,"Father,"" Eliza had said with ladylike dignity, as she led Oliver for the first time into the sitting-room of the cottage, ""I want you to meet Mr. Gant.""  Major Pentland rose slowly from his rocker by the fire, folded a large knife, and put the apple he had been peeling on the mantel. Bacchus looked up benevolently from a whittled stick, and Will, glancing up from his stubby nails which he was paring as usual, greeted the visitor with a birdlike nod and wink. The men amused themselves constantly with pocket knives.",1
50,"Major Pentland advanced slowly toward Gant. He was a stocky fleshy man in the middle fifties, with a ruddy face, a patriarchal beard, and the thick complacent features of his tribe. It's W. O. Gant, isn't it? he asked in a drawling unctuous voice.",1
51,"Yes,"" said Oliver, ""that's right. From what Eliza's been telling me about you,"" said the Major, giving the signal to his audience, ""I was going to say it ought to be L. E. Gant. The room sounded with the fat pleased laughter of the Pentlands.",1
52,"Whew!"" cried Eliza, putting her hand to the wing of her broad nose. I'll vow, father! You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Gant grinned with a thin false painting of mirth.",1
53,"The miserable old scoundrel, he thought. He's had that one bottled up for a week. You've met Will before,"" said Eliza.",1
54,"Both before and aft,"" said Will with a smart wink. When their laughter had died down, Eliza said:  ""And this--as the fellow says--is Uncle Bacchus. Yes, sir,"" said Bacchus beaming, ""as large as life an' twice as sassy.",1
55,"They call him Back-us everywhere else,"" said Will, including them all in a brisk wink, ""but here in the family we call him Behind- us. I suppose,"" said Major Pentland deliberately, ""that you've served on a great many juries?""  ""No,"" said Oliver, determined to endure the worst now with a frozen grin. Why?""  ""Because,"" said the Major looking around again, ""I thought you were a fellow who'd done a lot of COURTIN'.",1
56,"Then, amid their laughter, the door opened, and several of the others came in--Eliza's mother, a plain worn Scotchwoman, and Jim, a ruddy porcine young fellow, his father's beardless twin, and Thaddeus, mild, ruddy, brown of hair and eye, bovine, and finally Greeley, the youngest, a boy with lapping idiot grins, full of strange squealing noises at which they laughed. He was eleven, degenerate, weak, scrofulous, but his white moist hands could draw from a violin music that had in it something unearthly and untaught. And as they sat there in the hot little room with its warm odor of mellowing apples, the vast winds howled down from the hills, there was a roaring in the pines, remote and demented, the bare boughs clashed. And as they peeled, or pared, or whittled, their talk slid from its rude jocularity to death and burial: they drawled monotonously, with evil hunger, their gossip of destiny, and of men but newly lain in the earth. And as their talk wore on, and Gant heard the spectre moan of the wind, he was entombed in loss and darkness, and his soul plunged downward in the pit of night, for he saw that he must die a stranger--that all, all but these triumphant Pentlands, who banqueted on death--must die.",1
57,"And like a man who is perishing in the polar night, he thought of the rich meadows of his youth: the corn, the plum tree, and ripe grain. Why here? O lost!    2   Oliver married Eliza in May.",1
58,"After their wedding trip to Philadelphia, they returned to the house he had built for her on Woodson Street. With his great hands he had laid the foundations, burrowed out deep musty cellars in the earth, and sheeted the tall sides over with smooth trowellings of warm brown plaster. He had very little money, but his strange house grew to the rich modelling of his fantasy: when he had finished he had something which leaned to the slope of his narrow uphill yard, something with a high embracing porch in front, and warm rooms where one stepped up and down to the tackings of his whim. He built his house close to the quiet hilly street; he bedded the loamy soil with flowers; he laid the short walk to the high veranda steps with great square sheets of colored marble; he put a fence of spiked iron between his house and the world.",1
59,"Then, in the cool long glade of yard that stretched four hundred feet behind the house he planted trees and grape vines. And whatever he touched in that rich fortress of his soul sprang into golden life: as the years passed, the fruit trees--the peach, the plum, the cherry, the apple--grew great and bent beneath their clusters. His grape vines thickened into brawny ropes of brown and coiled down the high wire fences of his lot, and hung in a dense fabric, upon his trellises, roping his domain twice around. They climbed the porch end of the house and framed the upper windows in thick bowers. And the flowers grew in rioting glory in his yard-- the velvet-leaved nasturtium, slashed with a hundred tawny dyes, the rose, the snowball, the redcupped tulip, and the lily. The honeysuckle drooped its heavy mass upon the fence; wherever his great hands touched the earth it grew fruitful for him.",1
60,"For him the house was the picture of his soul, the garment of his will. But for Eliza it was a piece of property, whose value she shrewdly appraised, a beginning for her hoard. Like all the older children of Major Pentland she had, since her twentieth year, begun the slow accretion of land: from the savings of her small wage as teacher and book-agent, she had already purchased one or two pieces of earth. On one of these, a small lot at the edge of the public square, she persuaded him to build a shop. This he did with his own hands, and the labor of two negro men: it was a two-story shack of brick, with wide wooden steps, leading down to the square from a marble porch. Upon this porch, flanking the wooden doors, he placed some marbles; by the door, he put the heavy simpering figure of an angel.",1
61,"But Eliza was not content with his trade: there was no money in death. People, she thought, died too slowly. And she foresaw that her brother Will, who had begun at fifteen as helper in a lumber yard, and was now the owner of a tiny business, was destined to become a rich man. So she persuaded Gant to go into partnership with Will Pentland: at the end of a year, however, his patience broke, his tortured egotism leaped from its restraint, he howled that Will, whose business hours were spent chiefly in figuring upon a dirty envelope with a stub of a pencil, paring reflectively his stubby nails, or punning endlessly with a birdlike wink and nod, would ruin them all. Will therefore quietly bought out his partner's interest, and moved on toward the accumulation of a fortune, while Oliver returned to isolation and his grimy angels.",1
62,"The strange figure of Oliver Gant cast its famous shadow through the town. Men heard at night and morning the great formula of his curse to Eliza. They saw him plunge to house and shop, they saw him bent above his marbles, they saw him mould in his great hands-- with curse, and howl, with passionate devotion--the rich texture of his home. They laughed at his wild excess of speech, of feeling, and of gesture. They were silent before the maniac fury of his sprees, which occurred almost punctually every two months, and lasted two or three days. They picked him foul and witless from the cobbles, and brought him home--the banker, the policeman, and a burly devoted Swiss named Jannadeau, a grimy jeweller who rented a small fenced space among Gant's tombstones. And always they handled him with tender care, feeling something strange and proud and glorious lost in that drunken ruin of Babel. He was a stranger to them: no one--not even Eliza--ever called him by his first name. He was--and remained thereafter--""Mister"" Gant.",1
63,"And what Eliza endured in pain and fear and glory no one knew. He breathed over them all his hot lion-breath of desire and fury: when he was drunk, her white pursed face, and all the slow octopal movements of her temper, stirred him to red madness. She was at such times in real danger from his assault: she had to lock herself away from him. For from the first, deeper than love, deeper than hate, as deep as the unfleshed bones of life, an obscure and final warfare was being waged between them. Eliza wept or was silent to his curse, nagged briefly in retort to his rhetoric, gave like a punched pillow to his lunging drive--and slowly, implacably had her way. Year by year, above his howl of protest, he did not know how, they gathered in small bits of earth, paid the hated taxes, and put the money that remained into more land. Over the wife, over the mother, the woman of property, who was like a man, walked slowly forth.",1
64,"In eleven years she bore him nine children of whom six lived. The first, a girl, died in her twentieth month, of infant cholera; two more died at birth. The others outlived the grim and casual littering. The oldest, a boy, was born in 1885. He was given the name of Steve. The second, born fifteen months later, was a girl-- Daisy. The next, likewise a girl--Helen--came three years later. Then, in 1892, came twins--boys--to whom Gant, always with a zest for politics, gave the names of Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison. And the last, Luke, was born two years later, in 1894.",1
65,"Twice, during this period, at intervals of five years, Gant's periodic spree lengthened into an unbroken drunkenness that lasted for weeks. He was caught, drowning in the tides of his thirst. Each time Eliza sent him away to take a cure for alcoholism at Richmond. Once, Eliza and four of her children were sick at the same time with typhoid fever. But during a weary convalescence she pursed her lips grimly and took them off to Florida.",1
66,"Eliza came through stolidly to victory. As she marched down these enormous years of love and loss, stained with the rich dyes of pain and pride and death, and with the great wild flare of his alien and passionate life, her limbs faltered in the grip of ruin, but she came on, through sickness and emaciation, to victorious strength. She knew there had been glory in it: insensate and cruel as he had often been, she remembered the enormous beating color of his life, and the lost and stricken thing in him which he would never find. And fear and a speechless pity rose in her when at times she saw the small uneasy eyes grow still and darken with the foiled and groping hunger of old frustration. O lost!",1
67,"3   In the great processional of the years through which the history of the Gants was evolving, few years had borne a heavier weight of pain, terror, and wretchedness, and none was destined to bring with it more conclusive events than that year which marked the beginning of the twentieth century. For Gant and his wife, the year 1900, in which one day they found themselves, after growing to maturity in another century--a transition which must have given, wherever it has happened, a brief but poignant loneliness to thousands of imaginative people--had coincidences, too striking to be unnoticed, with other boundaries in their lives. In that year Gant passed his fiftieth birthday: he knew he was half as old as the century that had died, and that men do not often live as long as centuries. And in that year, too, Eliza, big with the last child she would ever have, went over the final hedge of terror and desperation and, in the opulent darkness of the summer night, as she lay flat in her bed with her hands upon her swollen belly, she began to design her life for the years when she would cease to be a mother.",1
68,"In the already opening gulf on whose separate shores their lives were founded, she was beginning to look, with the infinite composure, the tremendous patience which waits through half a lifetime for an event, not so much with certain foresight, as with a prophetic, brooding instinct. This quality, this almost Buddhistic complacency which, rooted in the fundamental structure of her life, she could neither suppress nor conceal, was the quality he could least understand, that infuriated him most. He was fifty: he had a tragic consciousness of time--he saw the passionate fulness of his life upon the wane, and he cast about him like a senseless and infuriate beast. She had perhaps a greater reason for quietude than he, for she had come on from the cruel openings of her life, through disease, physical weakness, poverty, the constant imminence of death and misery: she had lost her first child, and brought the others safely through each succeeding plague; and now, at forty-two, her last child stirring in her womb, she had a conviction, enforced by her Scotch superstition, and the blind vanity of her family, which saw extinction for others but not for itself, that she was being shaped to a purpose.",1
69,"As she lay in her bed, a great star burned across her vision in the western quarter of the sky; she fancied it was climbing heaven slowly. And although she could not have said toward what pinnacle her life was moving, she saw in the future freedom that she had never known, possession and power and wealth, the desire for which was mixed inextinguishably with the current of her blood. Thinking of this in the dark, she pursed her lips with thoughtful satisfaction, unhumorously seeing herself at work in the carnival, taking away quite easily from the hands of folly what it had never known how to keep.",1
70,"I'll get it! she thought, ""I'll get it. Will has it! Jim has it. And I'm smarter than they are. And with regret, tinctured with pain and bitterness, she thought of Gant:  ""Pshaw!",1
71,"If I hadn't kept after him he wouldn't have a stick to call his own to-day. What little we have got I've had to fight for; we wouldn't have a roof over our heads; we'd spend the rest of our lives in a rented house""--which was to her the final ignominy of shiftless and improvident people. And she resumed: The money he squanders every year in licker would buy a good lot: we could be well-to-do people now if we'd started at the very beginning. But he's always hated the very idea of owning anything: couldn't bear it, he told me once, since he lost his money in that trade in Sydney. If I'd been there, you can bet your bottom dollar there'd been no loss. Or, it'd be on the other side,"" she added grimly.",1
72,"And lying there while the winds of early autumn swept down from the Southern hills, filling the black air with dropping leaves, and making, in intermittent rushes, a remote sad thunder in great trees, she thought of the stranger who had come to live in her, and of that other stranger, author of so much woe, who had lived with her for almost twenty years. And thinking of Gant, she felt again an inchoate aching wonder, recalling the savage strife between them, and the great submerged struggle beneath, founded upon the hatred and the love of property, in which she did not doubt of her victory, but which baffled her, foiled her. I'll vow! she whispered. I'll vow! I never saw such a man!""  Gant, faced with the loss of sensuous delight, knowing the time had come when all his Rabelaisian excess in eating, drinking, and loving must come under the halter, knew of no gain that could compensate him for the loss of libertinism; he felt, too, the sharp ache of regret, feeling that he had possessed powers, had wasted chances, such as his partnership with Will Pentland, that might have given him position and wealth.",1
73,"He knew that the century had gone in which the best part of his life had passed; he felt, more than ever, the strangeness and loneliness of our little adventure upon the earth: he thought of his childhood on the Dutch farm, the Baltimore days, the aimless drift down the continent, the appalling fixation of his whole life upon a series of accidents. The enormous tragedy of accident hung like a gray cloud over his life. He saw more clearly than ever that he was a stranger in a strange land among people who would always be alien to him. Strangest of all, he thought, was this union, by which he had begotten children, created a life dependent on him, with a woman so remote from all he understood.",1
74,"He did not know whether the year 1900 marked for him a beginning or an ending; but with the familiar weakness of the sensualist, he resolved to make it an ending, burning the spent fire in him down to a guttering flame. In the first half of the month of January, still penitently true to the New Year's reformation, he begot a child: by Spring, when it was evident that Eliza was again pregnant, he had hurled himself into an orgy to which even a notable four months' drunk in 1896 could offer no precedent. Day after day he became maniacally drunk, until he fixed himself in a state of constant insanity: in May she sent him off again to a sanitarium at Piedmont to take the ""cure,"" which consisted simply in feeding him plainly and cheaply, and keeping him away from alcohol for six weeks, a regime which contributed no more ravenously to his hunger than it did to his thirst. He returned, outwardly chastened, but inwardly a raging furnace, toward the end of June: the day before he came back, Eliza, obviously big with child, her white face compactly set, walked sturdily into each of the town's fourteen saloons, calling up the proprietor or the bar- man behind his counter, and speaking clearly and loudly in the sodden company of bar clientry:  ""See here: I just came in to tell you that Mr. Gant is coming back to-morrow, and I want you all to know that if I hear of any of you selling him a drink, I'll put you in the penitentiary.",1
75,"The threat, they knew, was preposterous, but the white judicial face, the thoughtful pursing of the lips, and the right hand, which she held loosely clenched, like a man's, with the forefinger extended, emphasizing her proclamation with a calm, but somehow powerful gesture, froze them with a terror no amount of fierce excoriation could have produced. They received her announcement in beery stupefaction, muttering at most a startled agreement as she walked out. By God,"" said a mountaineer, sending a brown inaccurate stream toward a cuspidor, ""she'll do it, too. That woman means business. Hell!"" said Tim O'Donnel, thrusting his simian face comically above his counter, ""I wouldn't give W.O. a drink now if it was fifteen cents a quart",1
76,and we was alone in a privy. Is she gone yet? There was vast whisky laughter.,1
77,"Who is she? some one asked. She's Will Pentland's sister. By God, she'll do it then,"" cried several; and the place trembled again with their laughter.",1
78,"Will Pentland was in Loughran's when she entered. She did not greet him. When she had gone he turned to a man near him, prefacing his remark with a birdlike nod and wink:  ""Bet you can't do that,"" he said.",1
79,"Gant, when he returned, and was publicly refused at a bar, was wild with rage and humiliation. He got whisky very easily, of course, by sending a drayman from his steps, or some negro, in for it; but, in spite of the notoriety of his conduct, which had, he knew, become a classic myth for the children of the town, he shrank at each new advertisement of his behaviour; he became, year by year, more, rather than less, sensitive to it, and his shame, his quivering humiliation on mornings after, product of rasped pride and jangled nerves, was pitiable. He felt bitterly that Eliza had with deliberate malice publicly degraded him: he screamed denunciation and abuse at her on his return home.",1
80,"All through the summer Eliza walked with white boding placidity through horror--she had by now the hunger for it, waiting with terrible quiet the return of fear at night. Angered by her pregnancy, Gant went almost daily to Elizabeth's house in Eagle Crescent, whence he was delivered nightly by a band of exhausted and terrified prostitutes into the care of his son Steve, his oldest child, by now pertly free with nearly all the women in the district, who fondled him with good-natured vulgarity, laughed heartily at his glib innuendoes, and suffered him, even, to slap them smartly on their rumps, making for him roughly as he skipped nimbly away. Son,"" said Elizabeth, shaking Gant's waggling head vigorously, ""don't you carry on, when you grow up, like the old rooster here. But he's a nice old boy when he wants to be,"" she continued, kissing the bald spot on his head, and deftly slipping into the boy's hand the wallet Gant had, in a torrent of generosity, given to her. She was scrupulously honest.",1
81,"The boy was usually accompanied on these errands by Jannadeau and Tom Flack, a negro hack-man, who waited in patient constraint outside the latticed door of the brothel until the advancing tumult within announced that Gant had been enticed to depart. And he would go, either struggling clumsily and screaming eloquent abuse at his suppliant captors, or jovially acquiescent, bellowing a wanton song of his youth along the latticed crescent, and through the supper-silent highways of the town. Up in that back room, boys,       Up in THAT back room,       All among the fleas and bugs,       I pit-tee your sad doom. Home, he would be cajoled up the tall veranda stairs, enticed into his bed; or, resisting all compulsion, he would seek out his wife, shut usually in her room, howling taunts at her, and accusations of unchastity, since there festered in him dark suspicion, fruit of his age, his wasting energy.",1
82,"Timid Daisy, pale from fright, would have fled to the neighboring arms of Sudie Isaacs, or to the Tarkintons; Helen, aged ten, even then his delight, would master him, feeding spoonfuls of scalding soup into his mouth, and slapping him sharply with her small hand when he became recalcitrant. You DRINK this! You better! He was enormously pleased: they were both strung on the same wires.",1
83,"Again, he was beyond all reason. Extravagantly mad, he built roaring fires in his sitting-room, drenching the leaping fire with a can of oil; spitting exultantly into the answering roar, and striking up, until he was exhausted, a profane chant, set to a few recurrent bars of music, which ran, for forty minutes, somewhat like this:        ""O-ho--Goddam,       Goddam, Goddam,       O-ho--Goddam,       Goddam--Goddam. --adopting usually the measure by which clock-chimes strike out the hour.",1
84,"And outside, strung like apes along the wide wires of the fence, Sandy and Fergus Duncan, Seth Tarkinton, sometimes Ben and Grover themselves, joining in the glee of their friends, kept up an answering chant:        ""Old man Gant       Came home drunk! Old man Gant       Came home drunk! Daisy, from a neighbor's sanctuary, wept in shame and fear.",1
85,"But Helen, small thin fury, held on relentlessly: presently he would subside into a chair, and receive hot soup and stinging slaps with a grin. Upstairs Eliza lay, white-faced and watchfully. So ran the summer by. The last grapes hung in dried and rotten clusters to the vines; the wind roared distantly; September ended.",1
86,"One night the dry doctor, Cardiac, said:  ""I think we'll be through with this before to-morrow evening. He departed, leaving in the house a middle-aged country woman. She was a hard-handed practical nurse.",1
87,"At eight o'clock Gant returned alone. The boy Steve had stayed at home for ready dispatch at Eliza's need; for the moment the attention was shifted from the master. His great voice below, chanting obscenities, carried across the neighborhood: as she heard the sudden wild roar of flame up the chimney, shaking the house in its flight, she called Steve to her side, tensely:  ""Son, he'll burn us all up! she whispered.",1
88,"They heard a chair fall heavily below, his curse; they heard his heavy reeling stride across the dining-room and up the hall; they heard the sagging creak of the stair-rail as his body swung against it. He's coming! she whispered. He's coming! Lock the door, son!",1
89,"The boy locked the door. Are you there? Gant roared, pounding the flimsy door heavily with his great fist. Miss Eliza: are you there? howling at her the ironical title by which he addressed her at moments like this.",1
90,"And he screamed a sermon of profanity and woven invective:--  ""Little did I reck,"" he began, getting at once into the swing of preposterous rhetoric which he used half furiously, half comically, ""little did I reck the day I first saw her eighteen bitter years ago, when she came wriggling around the corner at me like a snake on her belly--[a stock epithet which from repetition was now heart- balm to him]--little did I reck that--that--that it would come to this,"" he finished lamely. He waited quietly, in the heavy silence, for some answer, knowing that she lay in her white-faced calm behind the door, and filled with the old choking fury because he knew she would not answer. Are you there? I say, are you there, woman? he howled, barking his big knuckles in a furious bombardment.",1
91,"There was nothing but the white living silence. Ah me! Ah me! he sighed with strong self-pity, then burst into forced snuffling sobs, which furnished a running accompaniment to his denunciation. Merciful God! he wept, ""it's fearful, it's awful, it's croo-el. What have I ever done that God should punish me like this in my old age? There was no answer.",1
92,"Cynthia!  Cynthia! he howled suddenly, invoking the memory of his first wife, the gaunt tubercular spinstress whose life, it was said, his conduct had done nothing to prolong, but whom he was fond of supplicating now, realizing the hurt, the anger he caused to Eliza by doing so. Cynthia! O Cynthia! Look down upon me in my hour of need! Give me succour! Give me aid! Protect me against this fiend out of Hell!",1
93,"And he continued, weeping in heavy snuffling burlesque:  ""O-boo- hoo-hoo!  Come down and save me, I beg of you, I entreat you, I implore you, or I perish. Silence answered. Ingratitude, more fierce than brutish beasts,"" Gant resumed, getting off on another track, fruitful with mixed and mangled quotation. You will be punished, as sure as there's a just God in heaven. You will all be punished. Kick the old man, strike him, throw him out on the street: he's no good any more. He's no longer able to provide for the family--send him over the hill to the poorhouse. That's where he belongs. Rattle his bones over the stones. Honor thy father that thy days may be long. Ah, Lord!        ""'Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through;        See what a rent the envious Casca made;        Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabbed;",1
94,"And, as he plucked his cursèd steel away,        Mark how the blood of Cæsar followed it--'""   ""Jeemy,"" said Mrs. Duncan at this moment to her husband, ""ye'd better go over. He's loose agin, an' she's wi' chile.",1
95,"The Scotchman thrust back his chair, moved strongly out of the ordered ritual of his life, and the warm fragrance of new-baked bread. At the gate, outside Gant's, he found patient Jannadeau, fetched down by Ben. They spoke matter-of-factly, and hastened up the steps as they heard a crash upstairs, and a woman's cry. Eliza, in only her night-dress, opened the door.",1
96,"Come quick! she whispered. Come quick!""  ""By God, I'll kill her,"" Gant screamed, plunging down the stairs at greater peril to his own life than to any other.",1
97,"I'll kill her now, and put an end to my misery. He had a heavy poker in his hand. The two men seized him; the burly jeweller took the poker from his hand with quiet strength.",1
98,"He cut his head on the bed-rail, mama,"" said Steve descending. It was true: Gant bled. Go for your Uncle Will, son. Quick! He was off like a hound.",1
99,"I think he meant it that time,"" she whispered. Duncan shut the door against the gaping line of neighbors beyond the gate. Ye'll be gettin' a cheel like that, Mrs. Gant. Keep him away from me!",1
100,"Keep him away! she cried out strongly. Aye, I will that! he answered in quiet Scotch.",1
101,"She turned to go up the stairs, but on the second step she fell heavily to her knees. The country nurse, returning from the bathroom, in which she had locked herself, ran to her aid. She went up slowly then between the woman and Grover. Outside Ben dropped nimbly from the low eave on to the lily beds: Seth Tarkinton, clinging to fence wires, shouted greetings.",1
102,"Gant went off docilely, somewhat dazed, between his two guardians: as his huge limbs sprawled brokenly in his rocker, they undressed him. Helen had already been busy in the kitchen for some time: she appeared now with boiling soup. Gant's dead eyes lit with recognition as he saw her.",1
103,"Why baby,"" he roared, making a vast maudlin circle with his arms, ""how are you? She put the soup down; he swept her thin body crushingly against him, brushing her cheek and neck with his stiff- bristled mustache, breathing upon her the foul rank odor of rye whisky. Oh, he's cut himself! The little girl thought she was going to cry.",1
104,"Look what they did to me, baby,"" he pointed to his wound and whimpered. Will Pentland, true son of that clan who forgot one another never, and who saw one another only in times of death, pestilence, and terror, came in. Good evening, Mr. Pentland,"" said Duncan.",1
105,"Jus' tolable,"" he said, with his bird-like nod and wink, taking in both men good-naturedly. He stood in front of the fire, paring meditatively at his blunt nails with a dull knife. It was his familiar gesture when in company: no one, he felt, could see what you thought about anything, if you pared your nails.",1
106,"The sight of him drew Gant instantly from his lethargy: he remembered the dissolved partnership; the familiar attitude of Will Pentland, as he stood before the fire, evoked all the markings he so heartily loathed in the clan--its pert complacency, its incessant punning, its success. Mountain Grills! he roared. Mountain Grills! The lowest of the low! The vilest of the vile!""  ""Mr. Gant!",1
107,"Mr. Gant!"" pleaded Jannadeau. What's the matter with you, W. O.?"" asked Will Pentland, looking up innocently from his fingers. Had something to eat that didn't agree with you?""--he winked pertly at Duncan, and went back to his fingers.",1
108,"Your miserable old father,"" howled Gant, ""was horsewhipped on the public square for not paying his debts. This was a purely imaginative insult, which had secured itself as truth, however, in Gant's mind, as had so many other stock epithets, because it gave him heart-cockle satisfaction. Horsewhipped upon his public square, was he?""  Will winked again, unable to resist the opening. They kept it mighty quiet, didn't they? But behind the intense good-humored posture of his face, his eyes were hard. He pursed his lips meditatively as he worked upon his fingers.",1
109,"But I'll tell you something about him, W. O.,"" he continued after a moment, with calm but boding judiciousness. He let his wife die a natural death in her own bed. He didn't try to kill her. No, by God!"" Gant rejoined.",1
110,"He let her starve to death. If the old woman ever got a square meal in her life she got it under my roof. There's one thing sure: she could have gone to Hell and back, twice over, before she got it from old Tom Pentland, or any of his sons. Will Pentland closed his blunt knife and put it in his pocket.",1
111,"Old Major Pentland never did an honest day's work in his life,"" Gant yelled, as a happy afterthought. Come now, Mr. Gant!"" said Duncan reproachfully. Hush!  Hush!"" whispered the girl fiercely, coming before him closely with the soup. She thrust a smoking ladle at his mouth, but he turned his head away to hurl another insult. She slapped him sharply across the mouth.",1
112,"You DRINK this! she whispered. And grinning meekly as his eyes rested upon her, he began to swallow soup.",1
113,"Will Pentland looked at the girl attentively for a moment, then glanced at Duncan and Jannadeau with a nod and wink. Without saying another word, he left the room, and mounted the stairs. His sister lay quietly extended on her back.",1
114,"How do you feel, Eliza? The room was heavy with the rich odor of mellowing pears; an unaccustomed fire of pine sticks burned in the grate: he took up his place before it, and began to pare his nails. Nobody knows--nobody knows,"" she began, bursting quickly into a rapid flow of tears, ""what I've been through. She wiped her eyes in a moment on a corner of the coverlid: her broad powerful nose, founded redly on her white face, was like flame.",1
115,"What you got good to eat?"" he said, winking at her with a comic gluttony. There are some pears in there on the shelf, Will. I put them there last week to mellow. He went into the big closet and returned in a moment with a large yellow pear; he came back to the hearth and opened the smaller blade of his knife.",1
116,"I'll vow, Will,"" she said quietly after a moment. I've had all I can put up with. I don't know what's got into him. But you can bet your bottom dollar I won't stand much more of it. I know how to shift for myself,"" she said, nodding her head smartly. He recognized the tone.",1
117,"He almost forgot himself:  ""See here, Eliza,"" he began, ""if you were thinking of building somewhere, I""--but he recovered himself in time--""I'll make you the best price you can get on the material,"" he concluded. He thrust a slice of pear quickly into his mouth.",1
118,"She pursed her mouth rapidly for some moments. No,"" she said. I'm not ready for that yet, Will. I'll let you know. The loose wood-coals crumbled on the hearth.",1
119,"I'll let you know,"" she said again. He clasped his knife and thrust it in a trousers pocket. Good night, Eliza,"" he said. I reckon Pett will be in to see you. I'll tell her you're all right. He went down the stairs quietly, and let himself out through the front door.",1
120,"As he descended the tall veranda steps, Duncan and Jannadeau came quietly down the yard from the sitting-room. How's W. O.?"" he asked. Ah, he'll be all right now,"" said Duncan cheerfully. He's fast asleep. The sleep of the righteous?"" asked Will Pentland with a wink.",1
121,"The Swiss resented the implied jeer at his Titan. It is a gread bitty,"" began Jannadeau in a low guttural voice, ""that Mr. Gant drinks. With his mind he could go far. When he's sober a finer man doesn't live. When he's sober?"" said Will, winking at him in the dark.",1
122,"What about when he's asleep. He's all right the minute Helen gets hold of him,"" Mr. Duncan remarked in his rich voice. It's wonderful what that little girl can do to him. Ah, I tell you!",1
123,Jannadeau laughed with guttural pleasure. That little girl knows her daddy in and out. The child sat in the big chair by the waning sitting-room fire: she read until the flames had died to coals--then quietly she shovelled ashes on them.,1
124,"Gant, fathoms deep in slumber, lay on the smooth leather sofa against the wall. She had wrapped him well in a blanket; now she put a pillow on a chair and placed his feet on it. He was rank with whisky stench; the window rattled as he snored.",1
125,"Thus, drowned in oblivion, ran his night; he slept when the great pangs of birth began in Eliza at two o'clock; slept through all the patient pain and care of doctor, nurse, and wife. 4   The baby was, to reverse an epigram, an unconscionable time in getting born; but when Gant finally awoke just after ten o'clock next morning, whimpering from tangled nerves, and the quivering shame of dim remembrance, he heard, as he drank the hot coffee Helen brought to him, a loud, long lungy cry above. Oh, my God, my God,"" he groaned. And he pointed toward the sound. Is it a boy or a girl?""  ""I haven't seen it yet, papa,"" Helen answered.",1
126,"They won't let us in. But Doctor Cardiac came out and told us if we were good he might bring us a little boy. There was a terrific clatter on the tin roof, the scolding country voice of the nurse: Steve dropped like a cat from the porch roof to the lily bed outside Gant's window.",1
127,"Steve, you damned scoundrel,"" roared the manor-lord with a momentary return to health, ""what in the name of Jesus are you doing? The boy was gone over the fence. I seen it! I seen it! his voice came streaking back.",1
128,"I seen it too! screamed Grover, racing through the room and out again in simple exultancy. If I catch you younguns on this roof agin,"" yelled the country nurse aloft, ""I'll take your hide off you. Gant had been momentarily cheered when he heard that his latest heir was a male; but he walked the length of the room now, making endless plaint.",1
129,"Oh my God, my God! Did this have to be put upon me in my old age? Another mouth to feed! It's fearful, it's awful, it's croo-el,"" and he began to weep affectedly. Then, realizing presently that no one was near enough to be touched by his sorrow, he paused suddenly and precipitated himself toward the door, crossing the dining-room, and, going up the hall, making loud lament:  ""Eliza!",1
130,"My wife! Oh, baby, say that you forgive me! He went up the stairs, sobbing laboriously.",1
131,"Don't you let him in here! cried the object of this prayer sharply with quite remarkable energy. Tell him he can't come in now,"" said Cardiac, in his dry voice, to the nurse, staring intently at the scales. We've nothing but milk to drink, anyway,"" he added.",1
132,"Gant was outside. Eliza, my wife!  Be merciful, I beg of you. If I had known--""  ""Yes,"" said the country nurse opening the door rudely, ""if the dog hadn't stopped to lift his leg he'd a-caught the rabbit!",1
133,"You get away from here! And she slammed it violently in his face. He went downstairs with hang-dog head, but he grinned slyly as he thought of the nurse's answer. He wet his big thumb quickly on his tongue.",1
134,"Merciful God! he said, and grinned. Then he set up his caged lament.",1
135,"I think this will do,"" said Cardiac, holding up something red, shiny, and puckered by its heels, and smacking it briskly on its rump, to liven it a bit. The heir apparent had, as a matter of fact, made his debut completely equipped with all appurtenances, dependences, screws, cocks, faucets, hooks, eyes, nails, considered necessary for completeness of appearance, harmony of parts, and unity of effect in this most energetic, driving, and competitive world. He was the complete male in miniature, the tiny acorn from which the mighty oak must grow, the heir of all ages, the inheritor of unfulfilled renown, the child of progress, the darling of the budding Golden Age and, what's more, Fortune and her Fairies, not content with well-nigh smothering him with these blessings of time and family, saved him up carefully until Progress was rotten-ripe with glory.",1
136,"Well, what are you going to call it?"" inquired Dr. Cardiac, referring thus, with shocking and medical coarseness, to this most royal imp. Eliza was better tuned to cosmic vibrations. With a full, if inexact, sense of what portended, she gave to Luck's Lad the title of Eugene, a name which, beautifully, means ""well born,"" but which, as any one will be able to testify, does not mean, has never meant, ""well bred. This chosen incandescence, to whom a name had already been given, and from whose centre most of the events in this chronicle must be seen, was borne in, as we have said, upon the very spear-head of history.",1
137,"But perhaps, reader, you have already thought of that? You HAVEN'T? Then let us refresh your historical memory. By 1900, Oscar Wilde and James A. McNeill Whistler had almost finished saying the things they were reported as saying, and that Eugene was destined to hear, twenty years later; most of the Great Victorians had died before the bombardment began; William McKinley was up for a second term, the crew of the Spanish navy had returned home in a tugboat.",1
138,"Abroad, grim old Britain had sent her ultimatum to the South Africans in 1899; Lord Roberts (""Little Bobs,"" as he was known affectionately to his men) was appointed commander-in-chief after several British reverses; the Transvaal Republic was annexed to Great Britain in September 1900, and formally annexed in the month of Eugene's birth. There was a Peace Conference two years later. Meanwhile, what was going on in Japan? I will tell you: the first parliament met in 1891, there was a war with China in 1894-95, Formosa was ceded in 1895. Moreover, Warren Hastings had been impeached and tried; Pope Sixtus the Fifth had come and gone; Dalmatia had been subdued by Tiberius; Belisarius had been blinded by Justinian; the wedding and funeral ceremonies of Wilhelmina Charlotte Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach and King George the Second had been solemnized, while those of Berengaria of Navarre to King Richard the First were hardly more than a distant memory; Diocletian, Charles the Fifth, and Victor Amadeus of Sardinia, had all abdicated their thrones; Henry James Pye, Poet Laureate of England, was with his fathers; Cassiodorus, Quintilian, Juvenal, Lucretius, Martial, and Albert the Bear of Brandenburg had answered the last great roll-call; the battles of Antietam, Smolensko, Drumclog, Inkerman, Marengo, Cawnpore, Killiecrankie, Sluys, Actium, Lepanto, Tewkesbury, Brandywine, Hohenlinden, Salamis, and the Wilderness had been fought both by land and by sea; Hippias had been expelled from Athens by the Alcæmonidæ and the Lacedæmonians; Simonides, Menander, Strabo, Moschus, and Pindar had closed their earthly accounts; the beatified Eusebius, Athanasius, and Chrysostom had gone to their celestial niches; Menkaura had built the Third Pyramid; Aspalta had led victorious armies; the remote Bermudas, Malta, and the Windward Isles had been colonized. In addition, the Spanish Armada had been defeated; President Abraham Lincoln assassinated, and the Halifax Fisheries Award had given $5,500,000 to Britain for twelve-year fishing privileges. Finally, only thirty or forty million years before, our earliest ancestors had crawled out of the primeval slime; and then, no doubt, finding the change unpleasant, crawled back in again.",1
139,"Such was the state of history when Eugene entered the theatre of human events in 1900. We would give willingly some more extended account of the world his life touched during the first few years, showing, in all its perspectives and implications, the meaning of life as seen from the floor, or from the crib, but these impressions are suppressed when they might be told, not through any fault of intelligence, but through lack of muscular control, the powers of articulation, and because of the recurring waves of loneliness, weariness, depression, aberration, and utter blankness which war against the order in a man's mind until he is three or four years old. Lying darkly in his crib, washed, powdered, and fed, he thought quietly of many things before he dropped off to sleep--the interminable sleep that obliterated time for him, and that gave him a sense of having missed forever a day of sparkling life. At these moments, he was heartsick with weary horror as he thought of the discomfort, weakness, dumbness, the infinite misunderstanding he would have to endure before he gained even physical freedom. He grew sick as he thought of the weary distance before him, the lack of co-ordination of the centres of control, the undisciplined and rowdy bladder, the helpless exhibition he was forced to give in the company of his sniggering, pawing brothers and sisters, dried, cleaned, revolved before them.",1
140,"He was in agony because he was poverty-stricken in symbols: his mind was caught in a net because he had no words to work with. He had not even names for the objects around him: he probably defined them for himself by some jargon, reinforced by some mangling of the speech that roared about him, to which he listened intently day after day, realizing that his first escape must come through language. He indicated as quickly as he could his ravenous hunger for pictures and print: sometimes they brought him great books profusely illustrated, and he bribed them desperately by cooing, shrieking with delight, making extravagant faces, and doing all the other things they understood in him. He wondered savagely how they would feel if they knew what he really thought: at other times he had to laugh at them and at their whole preposterous comedy of errors as they pranced around for his amusement, waggled their heads at him, tickled him roughly, making him squeal violently against his will. The situation was at once profoundly annoying and comic: as he sat in the middle of the floor and watched them enter, seeing the face of each transformed by a foolish leer, and hearing their voices become absurd and sentimental whenever they addressed him, speaking to him words which he did not yet understand, but which he saw they were mangling in the preposterous hope of rendering intelligible that which has been previously mutilated, he had to laugh at the fools, in spite of his vexation.",1
141,"And left alone to sleep within a shuttered room, with the thick sunlight printed in bars upon the floor, unfathomable loneliness and sadness crept through him: he saw his life down the solemn vista of a forest aisle, and he knew he would always be the sad one: caged in that little round of skull, imprisoned in that beating and most secret heart, his life must always walk down lonely passages. Lost. He understood that men were forever strangers to one another, that no one ever comes really to know any one, that imprisoned in the dark womb of our mother, we come to life without having seen her face, that we are given to her arms a stranger, and that, caught in that insoluble prison of being, we escape it never, no matter what arms may clasp us, what mouth may kiss us, what heart may warm us. Never, never, never, never, never.",1
142,"He saw that the great figures that came and went about him, the huge leering heads that bent hideously into his crib, the great voices that rolled incoherently above him, had for one another not much greater understanding than they had for him: that even their speech, their entire fluidity and ease of movement were but meagre communicants of their thought or feeling, and served often not to promote understanding, but to deepen and widen strife, bitterness, and prejudice. His brain went black with terror. He saw himself an inarticulate stranger, an amusing little clown, to be dandled and nursed by these enormous and remote figures. He had been sent from one mystery into another: somewhere within or without his consciousness he heard a great bell ringing faintly, as if it sounded undersea, and as he listened, the ghost of memory walked through his mind, and for a moment he felt that he had almost recovered what he had lost.",1
143,"Sometimes, pulling himself abreast the high walls of his crib, he glanced down dizzily at the patterns of the carpet far below; the world swam in and out of his mind like a tide, now printing its whole sharp picture for an instant, again ebbing out dimly and sleepily, while he pieced the puzzle of sensation together bit by bit, seeing only the dancing fire-sheen on the poker, hearing then the elfin clucking of the sun-warm hens, somewhere beyond in a distant and enchanted world. Again, he heard their morning-wakeful crowing dear and loud, suddenly becoming a substantial and alert citizen of life; or, going and coming in alternate waves of fantasy and fact, he heard the loud, faery thunder of Daisy's parlor music. Years later, he heard it again, a door opened in his brain: she told him it was Paderewski's ""Minuet.",1
144,"His crib was a great woven basket, well mattressed and pillowed within; as he grew stronger, he was able to perform extraordinary acrobatics in it, tumbling, making a hoop of his body, and drawing himself easily and strongly erect: with patient effort he could worm over the side on to the floor. There, he would crawl on the vast design of the carpet, his eyes intent upon great wooden blocks piled chaotically on the floor. They had belonged to his brother Luke: all the letters of the alphabet, in bright multi-colored carving, were engraved upon them.",1
145,"Holding them clumsily in his tiny hands, he studied for hours the symbols of speech, knowing that he had here the stones of the temple of language, and striving desperately to find the key that would draw order and intelligence from this anarchy. Great voices soared far above him, vast shapes came and went, lifting him to dizzy heights, depositing him with exhaustless strength. The bell rang under the sea.",1
146,"One day when the opulent Southern Spring had richly unfolded, when the spongy black earth of the yard was covered with sudden, tender grass, and wet blossoms, the great cherry tree seethed slowly with a massive gem of amber sap, and the cherries hung ripening in prodigal clusters, Gant took him from his basket in the sun on the high front porch, and went with him around the house by the lily bed, taking him back under trees singing with hidden birds, to the far end of the lot. Here the earth was unshaded, dry, clotted by the plough. Eugene knew by the stillness that it was Sunday: against the high wire fence there was the heavy smell of hot dock-weed. On the other side, Swain's cow was wrenching the cool coarse grass, lifting her head from time to time, and singing in her strong deep voice her Sunday exuberance. In the warm washed air, Eugene heard with absolute clearness all the brisk backyard sounds of the neighborhood, he became acutely aware of the whole scene, and as Swain's cow sang out again, he felt the flooded gates in him swing open. He answered ""Moo!"" phrasing the sound timidly but perfectly, and repeating it confidently in a moment when the cow answered.",1
147,"Gant's delight was boundless. He turned and raced back toward the house at the full stride of his legs. And as he went, he nuzzled his stiff mustache into Eugene's tender neck, mooing industriously and always getting an answer.",1
148,"Lord a' mercy!"" cried Eliza, looking from the kitchen window as he raced down the yard with breakneck strides, ""He'll kill that child yet.  And as he rushed up the kitchen steps--all the house, save the upper side was off the ground--she came out on the little latticed veranda, her hands floury, her nose stove-red.",1
149,"Why, what on earth are you doing, Mr. Gant?""  ""Moo-o-o! He said 'Moo-o-o!' Yes he did! Gant spoke to Eugene rather than to Eliza.",1
150,"Eugene answered him immediately: he felt it was all rather silly, and he saw he would be kept busy imitating Swain's cow for several days, but he was tremendously excited, nevertheless, feeling now that that wall had been breached. Eliza was likewise thrilled, but her way of showing it was to turn back to the stove, hiding her pleasure, and saying:  ""I'll vow, Mr. Gant. I never saw such an idiot with a child. Later, Eugene lay wakefully in his basket on the sitting-room floor, watching the smoking dishes go by in the eager hands of the combined family, for Eliza at this time cooked magnificently, and a Sunday dinner was something to remember.",1
151,"For two hours since their return from church, the little boys had been prowling hungrily around the kitchen: Ben, frowning proudly, kept his dignity outside the screen, making excursions frequently through the house to watch the progress of cookery; Grover came in and watched with frank interest until he was driven out; Luke, his broad humorous little face split by a wide exultant smile, rushed through the house, squealing exultantly:        ""Weenie, weedie, weeky,       Weenie, weedie, weeky,       Weenie, weedie, weeky,       Wee, Wee, Wee. He had heard Daisy and Josephine Brown doing Cæsar together, and his chant was his own interpretation of Cæsar's brief boast: ""Veni, Vidi, Vici. As Eugene lay in his crib, he heard through the open door the dining-room clatter, the shrill excitement of the boys, the clangor of steel and knife as Gant prepared to carve the roast, the reception of the morning's great event told over and over without variation, but with increasing zest.",1
152,"Soon,"" he thought, as the heavy food fragrance floated in to him, ""I shall be in there with them. And he thought lusciously of mysterious and succulent food. All through the afternoon upon the veranda Gant told the story, summoning the neighbors and calling upon Eugene to perform. Eugene heard clearly all that was said that day: he was not able to answer, but he saw now that speech was imminent.",1
153,"Thus, later, he saw the first two years of his life in brilliant and isolated flashes. His second Christmas he remembered vaguely as a period of great festivity: it accustomed him to the third when it came. With the miraculous habitude children acquire, it seemed that he had known Christmas forever.",1
154,"He was conscious of sunlight, rain, the leaping fire, his crib, the grim jail of winter: the second Spring, one warm day, he saw Daisy go off to school up the hill: it was the end of the noon recess, she had been home for lunch. She went to Miss Ford's School For Girls; it was a red brick residence on the corner at the top of the steep hill: he watched her join Eleanor Duncan just below. Her hair was braided in two long hanks down her back: she was demure, shy, maidenly, a timid and blushing girl; but he feared her attentions to him, for she bathed him furiously, wreaking whatever was explosive and violent beneath her placidity upon his hide. She really scrubbed him almost raw. He howled piteously. As she climbed the hill, he remembered her. He saw she was the same person.",1
155,"He passed his second birthday with the light growing. Early in the following Spring he became conscious of a period of neglect: the house was deadly quiet; Gant's voice no longer roared around him, the boys came and went on stealthy feet. Luke, the fourth to be attacked by the pestilence, was desperately ill with typhoid: Eugene was intrusted almost completely to a young slovenly negress. He remembered vividly her tall slattern figure, her slapping lazy feet, her dirty white stockings, and her strong smell, black and funky. One day she took him out on the side porch to play: it was a young Spring morning, bursting moistly from the thaw of the earth. The negress sat upon the side-steps and yawned while he grubbed in his dirty little dress along the path, and upon the lily bed. Presently, she went to sleep against the post. Craftily, he wormed his body through the wide wires of the fence, into the cindered alley that wound back to the Swains', and up to the ornate wooden palace of the Hilliards.",1
156,"They were among the highest aristocracy of the town: they had come from South Carolina, ""near Charleston,"" which in itself gave them at that time a commanding prestige. The house, a huge gabled structure of walnut-brown, which gave the effect of many angles and no plan, was built upon the top of the hill which sloped down to Gant's; the level ground on top before the house was tenanted by lordly towering oaks. Below, along the cindered alley, flanking Gant's orchard, there were high singing pines.",1
157,"Mr. Hilliard's house was considered one of the finest residences in the town. The neighborhood was middle-class, but the situation was magnificent, and the Hilliards carried on in the grand manner, lords of the castle who descended into the village, but did not mix with its people. All of their friends arrived by carriage from afar; every day punctually at two o'clock, an old liveried negro drove briskly up the winding alley behind two sleek brown mares, waiting under the carriage entrance at the side until his master and mistress should come out. Five minutes later they drove out, and were gone for two hours.",1
158,"This ritual, followed closely from his father's sitting-room window, fascinated Eugene for years after: the people and the life next door were crudely and symbolically above him. He felt a great satisfaction that morning in being at length in Hilliard's alley: it was his first escape, and it had been made into a forbidden and enhaloed region. He grubbed about in the middle of the road, disappointed in the quality of the cinders. The booming courthouse bell struck eleven times.",1
159,"Now, exactly at three minutes after eleven every morning, so unfailing and perfect was the order of this great establishment, a huge gray horse trotted slowly up the hill, drawing behind him a heavy grocery wagon, musty, spicy, odorous with the fine smells of grocery-stores and occupied exclusively by the Hilliard victuals, and the driver, a young negro man who, at three minutes past eleven every morning, according to ritual, was comfortably asleep. Nothing could possibly go wrong: the horse could not have been tempted even by a pavement of oats to betray his sacred mission. Accordingly he trotted heavily up the hill, turned ponderously into the alley ruts, and advanced heavily until, feeling the great circle of his right forefoot obstructed by some foreign particle, he looked down and slowly removed his hoof from what had recently been the face of a little boy.",1
160,"Then, with his legs carefully straddled, he moved on, drawing the wagon beyond Eugene's body, and stopping. Both negroes awoke simultaneously; there were cries within the house, and Eliza and Gant rushed out of doors. The frightened negro lifted Eugene, who was quite unconscious of his sudden return to the stage, into the burly arms of Doctor McGuire, who cursed the driver eloquently. His thick sensitive fingers moved swiftly around the bloody little face and found no fracture.",1
161,"He nodded briefly at their desperate faces:  ""He's being saved for Congress,"" said he. You have bad luck and hard heads, W. O.""  ""You Goddamned black scoundrel,"" yelled the master, turning with violent relief upon the driver. I'll put you behind the bars for this. He thrust his great length of hands through the fence and choked the negro, who mumbled prayers, and had no idea what was happening to him, save that he was the centre of a wild commotion.",1
162,"The negro girl, blubbering, had fled inward. This looks worse than it is,"" observed Dr. McGuire, laying the hero upon the lounge. Some hot water, please. Nevertheless, it took two hours to bring him round. Every one spoke highly of the horse.",1
163,"He had more sense than the nigger,"" said Gant, wetting his thumb. But all this, as Eliza knew in her heart, was part of the plan of the Dark Sisters. The entrails had been woven and read long since: the frail shell of skull which guarded life, and which might have been crushed as easily as a man breaks an egg, was kept intact. But Eugene carried the mark of the centaur for many years, though the light had to fall properly to reveal it.",1
164,"When he was older, he wondered sometimes if the Hilliards had issued from their high place when he had so impiously disturbed the order of the manor. He never asked, but he thought not: he imagined them, at the most, as standing superbly by a drawn curtain, not quite certain what had happened, but feeling that it was something unpleasant, with blood in it. Shortly after this, Mr. Hilliard had a ""No-Trespassing"" sign staked up in the lot.",1
165,"5   Luke got well after cursing doctor, nurse, and family for several weeks: it was stubborn typhoid. Gant was now head of a numerous family, which rose ladderwise from infancy to the adolescent Steve--who was eighteen--and the maidenly Daisy. She was seventeen and in her last year at high school. She was a timid, sensitive girl, looking like her name--Daisy-ish industrious and thorough in her studies: her teachers thought her one of the best students they had ever known. She had very little fire, or denial in her; she responded dutifully to instructions; she gave back what had been given to her. She played the piano without any passionate feeling for the music; but she rendered it honestly with a beautiful rippling touch. And she practised hours at a time.",1
166,"It was apparent, however, that Steve was lacking in scholarship. When he was fourteen, he was summoned by the school principal to his little office, to take a thrashing for truancy and insubordination. But the spirit of acquiescence was not in him: he snatched the rod from the man's hand, broke it, smote him solidly in the eye, and dropped gleefully eighteen feet to the ground.",1
167,"This was one of the best things he ever did: his conduct in other directions was less fortunate. Very early, as his truancy mounted, and after he had been expelled, and as his life hardened rapidly in a defiant viciousness, the antagonism between the boy and Gant grew open and bitter. Gant recognized perhaps most of his son's vices as his own: there was little, however, of his redeeming quality. Steve had a piece of tough suet where his heart should have been.",1
168,"Of them all, he had had very much the worst of it. Since his childhood he had been the witness of his father's wildest debauches. He had not forgotten. Also, as the oldest, he was left to shift for himself while Eliza's attention focussed on her younger children. She was feeding Eugene at her breast long after Steve had taken his first two dollars to the ladies of Eagle Crescent.",1
169,"He was inwardly sore at the abuse Gant heaped on him; he was not insensitive to his faults, but to be called a ""good-for-nothing bum,"" ""a worthless degenerate,"" ""a pool-room loafer,"" hardened his outward manner of swagger defiance. Cheaply and flashily dressed, with peg-top yellow shoes, flaring striped trousers, and a broad- brimmed straw hat with a colored band, he would walk down the avenue with a preposterous lurch, and a smile of strained assurance on his face, saluting with servile cordiality all who would notice him. And if a man of property greeted him, his lacerated but overgrown vanity would seize the crumb, and he would boast pitifully at home:  ""They all know Little Stevie! He's got the respect of all the big men in this town, all right, all right! Every one has a good word for Little Stevie except his own people. Do you know what J. T. Collins said to me to-day? What say?",1
170,"Who's that? Who's that?"" asked Eliza with comic rapidity, looking up from her darning. J. T. Collins--that's who! He's only worth about two hundred thousand. 'Steve,' he said, just like that, 'if I had your brains'""--He would continue in this way with moody self- satisfaction, painting a picture of future success when all who scorned him now would flock to his standard.",1
171,"Oh, yes,"" said he, ""they'll all be mighty anxious then to shake Little Stevie's hand. Gant, in a fury, gave him a hard beating when he had been expelled from school. He had never forgotten. Finally, he was told to go to work and support himself: he found desultory employment as a soda-jerker, or as delivery boy for a morning paper. Once, with a crony, Gus Moody, son of a foundry-man, he had gone off to see the world. Grimy from vagabondage they had crawled off a freight-train at Knoxville, Tennessee, spent their little money on food, and in a brothel, and returned, two days later, coal-black but boastful of their exploit.",1
172,"I'll vow,"" Eliza fretted, ""I don't know what's to become of that boy. It was the tragic flaw of her temperament to get to the vital point too late: she pursed her lips thoughtfully, wandered off in another direction, and wept when misfortune came. She always waited. Moreover, in her deepest heart, she had an affection for her oldest son, which, if it was not greater, was at least different in kind from what she bore for the others. His glib boastfulness, his pitiable brag, pleased her: they were to her indications of his ""smartness,"" and she often infuriated her two studious girls by praising them. Thus, looking at a specimen of his handwriting, she would say:  ""There's one thing sure: he writes a better hand than any of the rest of you, for all your schooling.",1
173,"Steve had early tasted the joys of the bottle, stealing, during the days when he was a young attendant of his father's debauch, a furtive swallow from the strong rank whisky in a half-filled flask: the taste nauseated him, but the experience made good boasting for his fellows. At fifteen, he had found, while smoking cigarettes with Gus Moody, in a neighbor's barn, a bottle wrapped in an oats sack by the worthy citizen, against the too sharp examination of his wife. When the man had come for secret potation some time later, and found his bottle half-empty, he had grimly dosed the remainder with Croton oil: the two boys were nauseously sick for several days.",1
174,"One day, Steve forged a check on his father. It was some days before Gant discovered it: the amount was only three dollars, but his anger was bitter. In a pronouncement at home, delivered loudly enough to publish the boy's offense to the neighborhood, he spoke of the penitentiary, of letting him go to jail, of being disgraced in his old age--a period of his life at which he had not yet arrived, but which he used to his advantage in times of strife.",1
175,"He paid the check, of course, but another name--that of ""forger""-- was added to the vocabulary of his abuse. Steve sneaked in and out of the house, eating his meals alone for several days. When he met his father little was said by either: behind the hard angry glaze of their eyes, they both looked depthlessly into each other; they knew that they could withhold nothing from each other, that the same sores festered in each, the same hungers and desires, the same crawling appetites polluted their blood. And knowing this, something in each of them turned away in grievous shame.",1
176,"Gant added this to his tirades against Eliza; all that was bad in the boy his mother had given him. Mountain Blood! Mountain Blood! he yelled. He's Greeley Pentland all over again. Mark my words,"" he continued, after striding feverishly about the house, muttering to himself and bursting finally into the kitchen, ""mark my words, he'll wind up in the penitentiary.",1
177,"And, her nose reddened by the spitting grease, she would purse her lips, saying little, save, when goaded, to make some return calculated to infuriate and antagonize him. Well, maybe if he hadn't been sent to every dive in town to pull his daddy out, he would turn out better. You lie, Woman!",1
178,"By God, you lie! he thundered magnificently but illogically. Gant drank less: save for a terrifying spree every six or eight weeks, which bound them all in fear for two or three days, Eliza had little to complain of on this score. But her enormous patience was wearing very thin because of the daily cycle of abuse. They slept now in separate rooms upstairs: he rose at six or six-thirty, dressed and went down to build the fires. As he kindled a blaze in the range, and a roaring fire in the sitting-room, he muttered constantly to himself, with an occasional oratorical rise and fall of his voice. In this way he composed and polished the flood of his invective: when the demands of fluency and emphasis had been satisfied he would appear suddenly before her in the kitchen, and deliver himself without preliminary, as the grocer's negro entered with pork chops or a thick steak:  ""Woman, would you have had a roof to shelter you to-day if it hadn't been for me?",1
179,"Could you have depended on your worthless old father, Tom Pentland, to give you one? Would Brother Will, or Brother Jim give you one? Did you ever hear of them giving any one anything? Did you ever hear of them caring for anything but their own miserable hides? DID you? Would any of them give a starving beggar a crust of bread? By God, no! Not even if he ran a bakery shop! Ah me! 'Twas a bitter day for me when I first came into this accursed country: little did I know what it would lead to. Mountain Grills! Mountain Grills! and the tide would reach its height.",1
180,"At times, when she tried to reply to his attack, she would burst easily into tears. This pleased him: he liked to see her cry. But usually she made an occasional nagging retort: deep down, between their blind antagonistic souls, an ugly and desperate war was being waged. Yet, had he known to what lengths these daily assaults might drive her, he would have been astounded: they were part of the deep and feverish discontent of his spirit, the rooted instinct to have an object for his abuse.",1
181,"Moreover, his own feeling for order was so great that he had a passionate aversion for what was slovenly, disorderly, diffuse. He was goaded to actual fury at times when he saw how carefully she saved bits of old string, empty cans and bottles, paper, trash of every description: the mania for acquisition, as yet an undeveloped madness in Eliza, enraged him. In God's name! he would cry with genuine anger. In God's name! Why don't you get rid of some of this junk? And he would move destructively toward it.",1
182,"No you don't, Mr. Gant! she would answer sharply. You never know when those things will come in handy. It was, perhaps, a reversal of custom that the deep-hungering spirit of quest belonged to the one with the greatest love of order, the most pious regard for ritual, who wove into a pattern even his daily tirades of abuse, and that the sprawling blot of chaos, animated by one all-mastering desire for possession, belonged to the practical, the daily person.",1
183,"Gant had the passion of the true wanderer, of him who wanders from a fixed point. He needed the order and the dependence of a home-- he was intensely a family man: their clustered warmth and strength about him was life. After his punctual morning tirade at Eliza, he went about the rousing of the slumbering children. Comically, he could not endure feeling, in the morning, that he was the only one awake and about.",1
184,"His waking cry, delivered by formula, with huge comic gruffness from the foot of the stairs, took this form:  ""Steve! Ben!  Grover!  Luke! You damned scoundrels: get up! In God's name, what will become of you! You'll never amount to anything as long as you live. He would continue to roar at them from below as if they were wakefully attentive above.",1
185,"When I was your age, I had milked four cows, done all the chores, and walked eight miles through the snow by this time. Indeed, when he described his early schooling, he furnished a landscape that was constantly three feet deep in snow, and frozen hard. He seemed never to have attended school save under polar conditions.",1
186,"And fifteen minutes later, he would roar again:  ""You'll never amount to anything, you good-for-nothing bums! If one side of the wall caved in, you'd roll over to the other. Presently now there would be the rapid thud of feet upstairs, and one by one they would descend, rushing naked into the sitting-room with their clothing bundled in their arms.",1
187,"Before his roaring fire they would dress. By breakfast, save for sporadic laments, Gant was in something approaching good humor. They fed hugely: he stoked their plates for them with great slabs of fried steak, grits fried in egg, hot biscuits, jam, fried apples. He departed for his shop about the time the boys, their throats still convulsively swallowing hot food and coffee, rushed from the house at the warning signal of the mellow-tolling final nine-o'clock school bell.",1
188,"He returned for lunch--dinner, as they called it--briefly garrulous with the morning's news; in the evening, as the family gathered in again, he returned, built his great fire, and launched his supreme invective, a ceremony which required a half hour in composition, and another three-quarters, with repetition and additions, in delivery. They dined then quite happily. So passed the winter. Eugene was three; they bought him alphabet books, and animal pictures, with rhymed fables below. Gant read them to him indefatigably: in six weeks he knew them all by memory.",1
189,Through the late winter and spring he performed numberless times for the neighbors: holding the book in his hands he pretended to read what he knew by heart. Gant was delighted: he abetted the deception. Every one thought it extraordinary that a child should read so young.,1
190,"In the Spring Gant began to drink again; his thirst withered, however, in two or three weeks, and shamefacedly he took up the routine of his life. But Eliza was preparing for a change. It was 1904; there was in preparation a great world's exposition at Saint Louis: it was to be the visual history of civilization, bigger, better, and greater than anything of its kind ever known before. Many of the Altamont people intended to go: Eliza was fascinated at the prospect of combining travel with profit.",1
191,"Do you know what? she began thoughtfully one night, as she laid down the paper, ""I've a good notion to pack up and go. Go?  Go where?""  ""To Saint Louis,"" she answered.",1
192,"Why, say--if things work out all right, we might simply pull out and settle down there. She knew that the suggestion of a total disruption of the established life, a voyage to new lands, a new quest of fortune fascinated him. It had been talked of years before when he had broken his partnership with Will Pentland.",1
193,"What do you intend to do out there? How are the children going to get along? Why, sir,"" she began smugly, pursing her lips thoughtfully, and smiling cunningly, ""I'll simply get me a good big house and drum up a trade among the Altamont people who are going.",1
194,"Merciful God, Mrs. Gant! he howled tragically, ""you surely wouldn't do a thing like that. I beg you not to. Why, pshaw, Mr. Gant, don't be such a fool.",1
195,"There's nothing wrong in keeping boarders. Some of the most respectable people in this town do it. She knew what a tender thing his pride was: he could not bear to be thought incapable of the support of his family--one of his most frequent boasts was that he was ""a good provider. Further, the residence of any one under his roof not of his blood and bone sowed the air about with menace, breached his castle walls. Finally, he had a particular revulsion against lodgers: to earn one's living by accepting the contempt, the scorn, and the money of what he called ""cheap boarders"" was an almost unendurable ignominy.",1
196,"She knew this but she could not understand his feeling. Not merely to possess property, but to draw income from it was part of the religion of her family, and she surpassed them all by her willingness to rent out a part of her home. She alone, in fact, of all the Pentlands was willing to relinquish the little moated castle of home; the particular secrecy and privacy of their walls she alone did not seem to value greatly. And she was the only one of them that wore a skirt.",1
197,"Eugene had been fed from her breast until he was more than three years old: during the winter he was weaned. Something in her stopped; something began. She had her way finally. Sometimes she would talk to Gant thoughtfully and persuasively about the World's Fair venture. Sometimes, during his evening tirades, she would snap back at him using the project as a threat. Just what was to be achieved she did not know. But she felt it was a beginning for her. And she had her way finally.",1
198,"Gant succumbed to the lure of new lands. He was to remain at home: if all went well he would come out later. The prospect, too, of release for a time excited him. Something of the old thrill of youth touched him. He was left behind, but the world lurked full of unseen shadows for a lonely man. Daisy was in her last year at school: she stayed with him. But it cost him more than a pang or two to see Helen go. She was almost fourteen.",1
199,"In early April, Eliza departed, bearing her excited brood about her, and carrying Eugene in her arms. He was bewildered at this rapid commotion, but he was electric with curiosity and activity. The Tarkintons and Duncans streamed in: there were tears and kisses. Mrs. Tarkinton regarded her with some awe. The whole neighborhood was a bit bewildered at this latest turn.",1
200,"Well, well--you never can tell,"" said Eliza, smiling tearfully and enjoying the sensation she had provided. If things go well we may settle down out there. You'll come back,"" said Mrs. Tarkinton with cheerful loyalty.",1
201,"There's no place like Altamont. They went to the station in the street-car: Ben and Grover gleefully sat together, guarding a big luncheon hamper. Helen clutched nervously a bundle of packages. Eliza glanced sharply at her long straight legs and thought of the half-fare.",1
202,"Say,"" she began, laughing indefinitely behind her hand, and nudging Gant, ""she'll have to scrooch up, won't she? They'll think you're mighty big to be under twelve,"" she went on, addressing the girl directly. Helen stirred nervously.",1
203,"We shouldn't have done that,"" Gant muttered. Pshaw!"" said Eliza. No one will ever notice her. He saw them into the train, disposed comfortably by the solicitous Pullman porter.",1
204,"Keep your eye on them, George,"" he said, and gave the man a coin. Eliza eyed it jealously. He kissed them all roughly with his mustache, but he patted his little girl's bony shoulders with his great hand, and hugged her to him. Something stabbed sharply in Eliza.",1
205,"They had an awkward moment. The strangeness, the absurdity of the whole project, and the monstrous fumbling of all life, held them speechless. Well,"" he began, ""I reckon you know what you're doing. Well, I tell you,"" she said, pursing her lips, and looking out the window, ""you don't know what may come out of this.",1
206,"He was vaguely appeased. The train jerked, and moved off slowly. He kissed her clumsily.",1
207,"Let me know as soon as you get there,"" he said, and he strode swiftly down the aisle. Good-by, good-by,"" cried Eliza, waving Eugene's small hand at the long figure on the platform. Children,"" she said, ""wave good-by to your papa. They all crowded to the window. Eliza wept.",1
208,"Eugene watched the sun wane and redden on a rocky river, and on the painted rocks of Tennessee gorges: the enchanted river wound into his child's mind forever. Years later, it was to be remembered in dreams tenanted with elvish and mysterious beauty. Stilled in great wonder, he went to sleep to the rhythmical pounding of the heavy wheels.",1
209,"They lived in a white house on the corner. There was a small plot of lawn in front, and a narrow strip on the side next to the pavement. He realized vaguely that it was far from the great central web and roar of the city--he thought he heard some one say four or five miles. Where was the river?",1
210,"Two little boys, twins, with straight very blond heads, and thin, mean faces, raced up and down the sidewalk before the house incessantly on tricycles. They wore white sailor-suits, with blue collars, and he hated them very much. He felt vaguely that their father was a bad man who had fallen down an elevator shaft, breaking his legs.",1
211,"The house had a back yard, completely enclosed by a red board fence. At the end was a red barn. Years later, Steve, returning home, said:  ""That section's all built up out there now. Where?",1
212,"One day in the hot barren back yard, two cots and mattresses had been set up for airing. He lay upon one luxuriously, breathing the hot mattress, and drawing his small legs up lazily. Luke lay upon the other. They were eating peaches.",1
213,A fly grew sticky on Eugene's peach. He swallowed it. Luke howled with laughter.,1
214,"Swallowed a fly! Swallowed a fly!""  He grew violently sick, vomited, and was unable to eat for some time. He wondered why he had swallowed the fly when he had seen it all the time.",1
215,"The summer came down blazing hot. Gant arrived for a few days, bringing Daisy with him. One night they drank beer at the Delmar Gardens. In the hot air, at a little table, he gazed thirstily at the beaded foaming stein: he would thrust his face, he thought, in that chill foam and drink deep of happiness. Eliza gave him a taste; they all shrieked at his bitter surprised face.",1
216,"Years later he remembered Gant, his mustache flecked with foam, quaffing mightily at the glass: the magnificent gusto, the beautiful thirst inspired in him the desire for emulation, and he wondered if all beer were bitter, if there were not a period of initiation into the pleasures of this great beverage. Faces from the old half-forgotten world floated in from time to time. Some of the Altamont people came and stayed at Eliza's house. One day, with sudden recollective horror he looked up into the brutal shaven face of Jim Lyda. He was the Altamont sheriff; he lived at the foot of the hill below Gant. Once, when Eugene was past two, Eliza had gone to Piedmont as witness in a trial. She was away two days; he was left in care of Mrs. Lyda. He had never forgotten Lyda's playful cruelty the first night.",1
217,"Now, one day, this monster appeared again, by devilish sleight, and Eugene looked up into the heavy evil of his face. Eugene saw Eliza standing near Jim; and as the terror in the small face grew, Jim made as if to put his hand violently upon her. At his cry of rage and fear, they both laughed: for a blind moment or two Eugene for the first time hated her: he was mad, impotent with jealousy and fear.",1
218,"At night the boys, Steve, Ben, and Grover, who had been sent out at once to seek employment by Eliza, returned from the Fair Grounds, chattering with the lively excitement of the day's bustle. Sniggering furtively, they talked suggestively about the Hoochy- Koochy: Eugene understood it was a dance. Steve hummed a monotonous, suggestive tune, and writhed sensually. They sang a song; the plaintive distant music haunted him. He learned it:        ""Meet me in Saint--Lou--iss, loo--ee,       Meet me at the Fair,       If you see the boys and girlies,       Tell them I'll be there.",1
219,"We will dance the Hoochy-Koochy--""   and so on. Sometimes, lying on a sunny quilt, Eugene grew conscious of a gentle peering face, a soft caressing voice, unlike any of the others in kind and quality, a tender olive skin, black hair, sloeblack eyes, exquisite, rather sad, kindliness. He nuzzled his soft face next to Eugene's, fondled and embraced him. On his brown neck he was birth-marked with a raspberry: Eugene touched it again and again with wonder. This was Grover--the gentlest and saddest of the boys.",1
220,"Eliza sometimes allowed them to take him on excursions. Once, they made a voyage on a river steamer: he went below and from the side- openings looked closely upon the powerful yellow snake, coiling slowly and resistlessly past. The boys worked on the Fair Grounds. They were call-boys at a place called the Inside Inn. The name charmed him: it flashed constantly through his brain. Sometimes his sisters, sometimes Eliza, sometimes the boys pulled him through the milling jungle of noise and figures, past the rich opulence and variety of the life of the Fair. He was drugged in fantasy as they passed the East India tea-house, and as he saw tall turbaned men who walked about within and caught for the first time, so that he never forgot, the slow incense of the East. Once in a huge building roaring with sound, he was rooted before a mighty locomotive, the greatest monster he had ever seen, whose wheels spun terrifically in grooves, whose blazing furnaces, raining hot red coals into the pit beneath, were fed incessantly by two grimed fire-painted stokers. The scene burned in his brain like some huge splendor out of Hell: he was appalled and fascinated by it.",1
221,"Again, he stood at the edge of the slow, terrific orbit of the Ferris Wheel, reeled down the blaring confusion of the midway, felt his staggering mind converge helplessly into all the mad phantasmagoria of the carnival; he heard Luke's wild story of the snake-eater, and shrieked in agony when they threatened to take him in. Once Daisy, yielding to the furtive cat-cruelty below her mild placidity, took him with her through the insane horrors of the scenic railway; they plunged bottomlessly from light into roaring blackness, and as his first yell ceased with a slackening of the car, rolled gently into a monstrous lighted gloom peopled with huge painted grotesques, the red maws of fiendish heads, the cunning appearances of death, nightmare, and madness. His unprepared mind was unrooted by insane fear: the car rolled downward from one lighted cavern to another, and as his heart withered to a pea, he heard from the people about him loud gusty laughter, in which his sister joined. His mind, just emerging from the unreal wilderness of childish fancy, gave way completely in this Fair, and he was paralyzed by the conviction, which often returned to him in later years, that his life was a fabulous nightmare and that, by cunning and conspirate artifice, he had surrendered all his hope, belief, and confidence to the lewd torture of demons masked in human flesh. Half-sensible, and purple with gasping terror, he came out finally into the warm and practical sunlight.",1
222,"His last remembrance of the Fair came from a night in early autumn: with Daisy again he sat upon the driver's seat of a motor bus, listening for the first time to the wonder of its labored chugging, as they rolled, through ploughing sheets of rain, around the gleaming roads, and by the Cascades, pouring their water down before a white building jewelled with ten thousand lights. The summer had passed. There was the rustling of autumn winds, a whispering breath of departed revelry: carnival was almost done.",1
223,"And now the house grew very still: he saw his mother very little, he did not leave the house, he was in the care of his sisters, and he was constantly admonished to silence. One day Gant came back a second time. Grover was down with typhoid.",1
224,"He said he ate a pear at the Fair grounds,"" Eliza repeated the story for the hundredth time. He came home and complained of feeling sick. I put my hand on his head and he was burning up. 'Why, child,' I said, 'what on earth--?'""  Her black eyes brightened in her white face: she was afraid.",1
225,"She pursed her lips and spoke hopefully. Hello, son,"" said Gant, casually entering the room; his heart shrivelled as he saw the boy. Eliza pursed her lips more and more thoughtfully after each visit the doctor made; she seized every spare crumb of encouragement and magnified it, but her heart was sick. Then one night, tearing away the mask suddenly, she came swiftly from the boy's room.",1
226,"Mr. Gant,"" she said in a whisper, pursing her lips. She shook her white face at him silently as if unable to speak. Then, rapidly, she concluded:  ""He's gone, he's gone, he's gone!""  Eugene was deep in midnight slumber.",1
227,"Some one shook him, loosening him slowly from his drowsiness. Presently he found himself in the arms of Helen, who sat on the bed holding him, her morbid stricken little face fastened on him. She spoke to him distinctly and slowly in a subdued voice, charged somehow with a terrible eagerness:  ""Do you want to see Grover?"" she whispered.",1
228,"He's on the cooling board. He wondered what a cooling board was; the house was full of menace. She bore him out into the dimly lighted hall, and carried him to the rooms at the front of the house. Behind the door he heard low voices. Quietly she opened it; the light blazed brightly on the bed. Eugene looked, horror swarmed like poison through his blood. Behind the little wasted shell that lay there he remembered suddenly the warm brown face, the soft eyes, that once had peered down at him: like one who has been mad, and suddenly recovers reason, he remembered that forgotten face he had not seen in weeks, that strange bright loneliness that would not return. O lost, and by the wind grieved, ghost, come back again.",1
229,"Eliza sat heavily on a chair, her face bent sideways on her rested hand. She was weeping, her face contorted by the comical and ugly grimace that is far more terrible than any quiet beatitude of sorrow. Gant comforted her awkwardly but, looking at the boy from time to time, he went out into the hall and cast his arms forth in agony, in bewilderment.",1
230,"The undertakers put the body in a basket and took it away. He was just twelve years and twenty days old,"" said Eliza over and over, and this fact seemed to trouble her more than any other. You children go and get some sleep now,"" she commanded suddenly and, as she spoke, her eye fell on Ben who stood puzzled and scowling, gazing in with his curious old-man's look. She thought of the severance of the twins; they had entered life within twenty minutes of each other; her heart was gripped with pity at the thought of the boy's loneliness. She wept anew. The children went to bed. For some time Eliza and Gant continued to sit alone in the room. Gant leaned his face in his powerful hands. The best boy I had,"" he muttered. By God, he was the best of the lot.",1
231,"And in the ticking silence they recalled him, and in the heart of each was fear and remorse, because he had been a quiet boy, and there were many, and he had gone unnoticed. I'll never be able to forget his birthmark,"" Eliza whispered, ""Never, never. Then presently each thought of the other; they felt suddenly the horror and strangeness of their surroundings.",1
232,"They thought of the vine-wound house in the distant mountains, of the roaring fires, the tumult, the cursing, the pain, of their blind and tangled lives, and of blundering destiny which brought them here now in this distant place, with death, after the carnival's close. Eliza wondered why she had come: she sought back through the hot and desperate mazes for the answer:  ""If I had known,"" she began presently, ""if I had known how it would turn out--""  ""Never mind,"" he said, and he stroked her awkwardly. By God! he added dumbly after a moment. It's pretty strange when you come to think about it.",1
233,"And as they sat there more quietly now, swarming pity rose in them-- not for themselves, but for each other, and for the waste, the confusion, the groping accident of life. Gant thought briefly of his four and fifty years, his vanished youth, his diminishing strength, the ugliness and badness of so much of it; and he had the very quiet despair of a man who knows the forged chain may not be unlinked, the threaded design unwound, the done undone. If I had known. If I had known,"" said Eliza. And then:  ""I'm sorry. But he knew that her sorrow at that moment was not for him or for herself, or even for the boy whom idiot chance had thrust in the way of pestilence, but that, with a sudden inner flaming of her clairvoyant Scotch soul, she had looked cleanly, without pretense for the first time, upon the inexorable tides of Necessity, and that she was sorry for all who had lived, were living, or would live, fanning with their prayers the useless altar flames, suppliant with their hopes to an unwitting spirit, casting the tiny rockets of their belief against remote eternity, and hoping for grace, guidance, and delivery upon the spinning and forgotten cinder of this earth. O lost.",1
234,"They went home immediately. At every station Gant and Eliza made restless expeditions to the baggage-car. It was gray autumnal November: the mountain forests were quilted with dry brown leaves. They blew about the streets of Altamont, they were deep in lane and gutter, they scampered dryly along before the wind.",1
235,"The car ground noisily around the curve at the hill-top. The Gants descended: the body had already been sent on from the station. As Eliza came slowly down the hill, Mrs. Tarkinton ran from her house sobbing. Her eldest daughter had died a month before. The two women gave loud cries as they saw each other, and rushed together.",1
236,"In Gant's parlor, the coffin had already been placed on trestles, the neighbors, funeral-faced and whispering, were assembled to greet them. That was all.    6   The death of Grover gave Eliza the most terrible wound of her life: her courage was snapped, her slow but powerful adventure toward freedom was abruptly stopped. Her flesh seemed to turn rotten when she thought of the distant city and the Fair: she was appalled before the hidden adversary who had struck her down.",1
237,"With her desperate sadness she encysted herself within her house and her family, reclaimed that life she had been ready to renounce, lived laborious days and tried to drink, in toil, oblivion. But the dark lost face gleamed like a sudden and impalpable faun within the thickets of memory: she thought of the mark on his brown neck and wept. During the grim winter the shadows lifted slowly. Gant brought back the roaring fires, the groaning succulent table, the lavish and explosive ritual of the daily life. The old gusto surged back in their lives.",1
238,"And, as the winter waned, the interspersed darkness in Eugene's brain was lifted slowly, days, weeks, months began to emerge in consecutive brightness; his mind came from the confusion of the Fair: life opened practically. Secure and conscious now in the guarded and sufficient strength of home, he lay with well-lined belly before the roasting vitality of the fire, poring insatiably over great volumes in the bookcase, exulting in the musty odor of the leaves, and in the pungent smell of their hot hides. The books he delighted in most were three huge calf-skin volumes called Ridpath's History of the World. Their numberless pages were illustrated with hundreds of drawings, engravings, wood-cuts: he followed the progression of the centuries pictorially before he could read. The pictures of battle delighted him most of all. Exulting in the howl of the beaten wind about the house, the thunder of great trees, he committed himself to the dark storm, releasing the mad devil's hunger all men have in them, which lusts for darkness, the wind, and incalculable speed. The past unrolled to him in separate and enormous visions; he built unending legends upon the pictures of the kings of Egypt, charioted swiftly by soaring horses, and something infinitely old and recollective seemed to awaken in him as he looked on fabulous monsters, the twined beards and huge beast-bodies of Assyrian kings, the walls of Babylon. His brain swarmed with pictures--Cyrus directing the charge, the spear-forest of the Macedonian phalanx, the splintered oars, the numberless huddle of the ships at Salamis, the feasts of Alexander, the terrific melee of the knights, the shattered lances, the axe and the sword, the massed pikemen, the beleaguered walls, the scaling ladders heavy with climbing men hurled backward, the Swiss who flung his body on the lances, the press of horse and foot, the gloomy forests of Gaul and Cæsarian conquests. Gant sat farther away, behind him, swinging violently back and forth in a stout rocker, spitting clean and powerful spurts of tobacco-juice over his son's head into the hissing fire.",1
239,"Or again, Gant would read to him with sonorous and florid rhetoric passages from Shakespeare, among which he heard most often Marc Antony's funeral oration, Hamlet's soliloquy, the banquet scene in Macbeth, and the scene between Desdemona and Othello before he strangles her. Or, he would recite or read poetry, for which he had a capacious and retentive memory. His favorites were:  ""O why should the spirit of mortal be proud"" (""Lincoln's favorite poem,"" he was fond of saying); ""'We are lost,' the captain shouted, As he staggered down the stairs""; ""I remember, I remember, the house where I was born""; ""Ninety and nine with their captain, Rode on the enemy's track, Rode in the gray light of morning, Nine of the ninety came back""; ""The boy stood on the burning deck""; and ""Half a league, half a league, half a league onward. Sometimes he would get Helen to recite ""Still sits the schoolhouse by the road, a ragged beggar sunning; Around it still the sumachs grow, and blackberry vines are running.",1
240,"And when she had told how grasses had been growing over the girl's head for forty years, and how the gray-haired man had found in life's harsh school how few hated to go above him, because, you see, they love him, Gant would sigh heavily, and say with a shake of his head:  ""Ah me! There was never a truer word spoken than that. The family was at the very core and ripeness of its life together.",1
241,"Gant lavished upon it his abuse, his affection, and his prodigal provisioning. They came to look forward eagerly to his entrance, for he brought with him the great gusto of living, of ritual. They would watch him in the evening as he turned the corner below with eager strides, follow carefully the processional of his movements from the time he flung his provisions upon the kitchen table to the re-kindling of his fire, with which he was always at odds when he entered, and on to which he poured wood, coal and kerosene lavishly. This done, he would remove his coat and wash himself at the basin vigorously, rubbing his great hands across his shaven, tough-bearded face with the cleansing and male sound of sandpaper. Then he would thrust his body against the door jamb and scratch his back energetically by moving it violently to and fro. This done, he would empty another half can of kerosene on the howling flame, lunging savagely at it, and muttering to himself.",1
242,"Then, biting off a good hunk of powerful apple tobacco, which lay ready for his use on the mantel, he would pace back and forth across his room fiercely, oblivious of his grinning family who followed these ceremonies with exultant excitement, as he composed his tirade. Finally, he would burst in on Eliza in the kitchen, plunging to the heart of denunciation with a mad howl. His turbulent and undisciplined rhetoric had acquired, by the regular convention of its usage, something of the movement and directness of classical epithet: his similes were preposterous, created really in a spirit of vulgar mirth, and the great comic intelligence that was in the family--down to the youngest--was shaken daily by it. The children grew to await his return in the evening with a kind of exhilaration. Indeed, Eliza herself, healing slowly and painfully her great hurt, got a certain stimulation from it; but there was still in her a fear of the periods of drunkenness, and latently, a stubborn and unforgiving recollection of the past.",1
243,"But, during that winter, as death, assaulted by the quick and healing gaiety of children, those absolute little gods of the moment, lifted itself slowly out of their hearts, something like hopefulness returned to her. They were a life unto themselves--how lonely they were they did not know, but they were known to every one and friended by almost no one. Their status was singular--if they could have been distinguished by caste, they would probably have been called middle-class, but the Duncans, the Tarkintons, all their neighbors, and all their acquaintances throughout the town, never drew in to them, never came into the strange rich color of their lives, because they had twisted the design of all orderly life, because there was in them a mad, original, disturbing quality which they did not suspect. And companionship with the elect-- those like the Hilliards--was equally impossible, even if they had had the gift or the desire for it. But they hadn't.",1
244,"Gant was a great man, and not a singular one, because singularity does not hold life in unyielding devotion to it. As he stormed through the house, unleashing his gathered bolts, the children followed him joyously, shrieking exultantly as he told Eliza he had first seen her ""wriggling around the corner like a snake on her belly,"" or, as coming in from freezing weather he had charged her and all the Pentlands with malevolent domination of the elements. We will freeze,"" he yelled, ""we will freeze in this hellish, damnable, cruel and God-forsaken climate. Does Brother Will care? Does Brother Jim care? Did the Old Hog, your miserable old father, care? Merciful God! I have fallen into the hands of fiends incarnate, more savage, more cruel, more abominable than the beasts of the field. Hellhounds that they are, they will sit by and gloat at my agony until I am done to death. He paced rapidly about the adjacent wash-room for a moment, muttering to himself, while grinning Luke stood watchfully near.",1
245,"But they can eat! he shouted, plunging suddenly at the kitchen door. They can eat--when some one else will feed them. I shall never forget the Old Hog as long as I live. Cr-unch, Cr-unch, Cr-unch,""--they were all exploded with laughter as his face assumed an expression of insane gluttony, and as he continued, in a slow, whining voice intended to represent the speech of the late Major: ""'Eliza, if you don't mind I'll have some more of that chicken,' when the old scoundrel had shovelled it down his throat so fast we had to carry him away from the table. As his denunciation reached some high extravagance the boys would squeal with laughter, and Gant, inwardly tickled, would glance around slyly with a faint grin bending the corners of his thin mouth.",1
246,"Eliza herself would laugh shortly, and then exclaim roughly:  ""Get out of here! I've had enough of your goings-on for one night. Sometimes, on these occasions, his good humor grew so victorious that he would attempt clumsily to fondle her, putting one arm stiffly around her waist, while she bridled, became confused, and half-attempted to escape, saying:  ""Get away!",1
247,"Get away from me! It's too late for that now. Her white embarrassed smile was at once painful and comic: tears pressed closely behind it. At these rare, unnatural exhibitions of affection, the children laughed with constraint, fidgeted restlessly, and said:  ""Aw, papa, don't. Eugene, when he first noticed an occurrence of this sort, was getting on to his fifth year: shame gathered in him in tangled clots, aching in his throat; he twisted his neck about convulsively, smiling desperately as he did later when he saw poor buffoons or mawkish scenes in the theatre.",1
248,"And he was never after able to see them touch each other with affection, without the same inchoate and choking humiliation: they were so used to the curse, the clamor, and the roughness, that any variation into tenderness came as a cruel affectation. But as the slow months, gummed with sorrow, dropped more clearly, the powerful germinal instinct for property and freedom began to reawaken in Eliza, and the ancient submerged struggle between their natures began again. The children were growing up--Eugene had found playmates--Harry Tarkinton and Max Isaacs. Her sex was a fading coal.",1
249,"Season by season, there began again the old strife of ownership and taxes. Returning home, with the tax-collector's report in his hand, Gant would be genuinely frantic with rage. In the name of God, Woman, what are we coming to? Before another year we'll all go to the poorhouse. Ah, Lord! I see very well where it will all end. I'll go to the wall, every penny we've got will go into the pockets of those accursed swindlers, and the rest will come under the sheriff's hammer. I curse the day I was ever fool enough to buy the first stick. Mark my words, we'll be living in soup-kitchens before this fearful, this awful, this hellish and damnable winter is finished. She would purse her lips thoughtfully as she went over the list, while he looked at her with a face of strained agony.",1
250,"Yes, it does look pretty bad,"" she would remark. And then:  ""It's a pity you didn't listen to me last summer, Mr. Gant, when we had a chance of trading in that worthless old Owenby place for those two houses on Carter Street. We could have been getting forty dollars a month rent on them ever since. I never want to own another foot of land as long as I live,"" he yelled.",1
251,"It's kept me a poor man all my life, and when I die they'll have to give me six feet of earth in Pauper's Field. And he would grow broodingly philosophic, speaking of the vanity of human effort, the last resting-place in earth of rich and poor, the significant fact that we could ""take none of it with us,"" ending perhaps with ""Ah me! It all comes to the same in the end, anyway.",1
252,"Or, he would quote a few stanzas of Gray's Elegy, using that encyclopædia of stock melancholy with rather indefinite application:        ""--Await alike th' inevitable hour,       The paths of glory lead but to the grave.  But Eliza sat grimly on what they had.",1
253,"Gant, for all his hatred of land ownership, was proud of living under his own shelter, and indeed proud in the possession of anything that was sanctified by his usage, and that gave him comfort. He would have liked ready and unencumbered affluence--the possession of huge sums of money in the bank and in his pocket, the freedom to travel grandly, to go before the world spaciously. He liked to carry large sums of money in his pocket, a practice of which Eliza disapproved, and for which she reprimanded him frequently. Once or twice, when he was drunk, he had been robbed: he would brandish a roll of bills about under the stimulation of whisky, and dispense large sums to his children--ten, twenty, fifty dollars to each, with maudlin injunctions to ""take it all! Take it all, God damn it! But next day he was equally assiduous in his demands for its return: Helen usually collected it from the sometimes unwilling fingers of the boys. She would give it to him next day. She was fifteen or sixteen years old, and almost six feet high: a tall thin girl, with large hands and feet, big-boned, generous features, behind which the hysteria of constant excitement lurked.",1
254,"The bond between the girl and her father grew stronger every day: she was nervous, intense, irritable, and abusive as he was. She adored him. He had begun to suspect that this devotion, and his own response to it, was a cause more and more of annoyance to Eliza, and he was inclined to exaggerate and emphasize it, particularly when he was drunk, when his furious distaste for his wife, his obscene complaint against her, was crudely balanced by his maudlin docility to the girl.",1
255,"And Eliza's hurt was deeper because she knew that just at this time, when her slightest movement goaded him, did what was most rawly essential in him reveal itself. She was forced to keep out of his way, lock herself in her room, while her young daughter victoriously subdued him. The friction between Helen and Eliza was often acute: they spoke sharply and curtly to each other, and were painfully aware of the other's presence in cramped quarters. And, in addition to the unspoken rivalry over Gant, the girl was in the same way, equally, rasped by the temperamental difference of Eliza--driven to fury at times by her slow, mouth-pursing speech, her placidity, the intonations of her voice, the deep abiding patience of her nature.",1
256,"They fed stupendously. Eugene began to observe the food and the seasons. In the autumn, they barrelled huge frosty apples in the cellar. Gant bought whole hogs from the butcher, returning home early to salt them, wearing a long work-apron, and rolling his sleeves half up his lean hairy arms. Smoked bacons hung in the pantry, the great bins were full of flour, the dark recessed shelves groaned with preserved cherries, peaches, plums, quinces, apples, pears. All that he touched waxed in rich pungent life: his Spring gardens, wrought in the black wet earth below the fruit trees, flourished in huge crinkled lettuces that wrenched cleanly from the loamy soil with small black clots stuck to their crisp stocks; fat red radishes; heavy tomatoes. The rich plums lay bursted on the grass; his huge cherry trees oozed with heavy gum jewels; his apple trees bent with thick green clusters. The earth was spermy for him like a big woman.",1
257,"Spring was full of cool dewy mornings, spurting winds, and storms of intoxicating blossoms, and in this enchantment Eugene first felt the mixed lonely ache and promise of the seasons. In the morning they rose in a house pungent with breakfast cookery, and they sat at a smoking table loaded with brains and eggs, ham, hot biscuit, fried apples seething in their gummed syrups, honey, golden butter, fried steak, scalding coffee. Or there were stacked batter-cakes, rum-colored molasses, fragrant brown sausages, a bowl of wet cherries, plums, fat juicy bacon, jam. At the mid-day meal, they ate heavily: a huge hot roast of beef, fat buttered lima- beans, tender corn smoking on the cob, thick red slabs of sliced tomatoes, rough savory spinach, hot yellow corn-bread, flaky biscuits, a deep-dish peach and apple cobbler spiced with cinnamon, tender cabbage, deep glass dishes piled with preserved fruits-- cherries, pears, peaches. At night they might eat fried steak, hot squares of grits fried in egg and butter, pork-chops, fish, young fried chicken.",1
258,"For the Thanksgiving and Christmas feasts four heavy turkeys were bought and fattened for weeks: Eugene fed them with cans of shelled corn several times a day, but he could not bear to be present at their executions, because by that time their cheerful excited gobbles made echoes in his heart. Eliza baked for weeks in advance: the whole energy of the family focussed upon the great ritual of the feast. A day or two before, the auxiliary dainties arrived in piled grocer's boxes--the magic of strange foods and fruits was added to familiar fare: there were glossed sticky dates, cold rich figs, cramped belly to belly in small boxes, dusty raisins, mixed nuts--the almond, pecan, the meaty nigger-toe, the walnut, sacks of assorted candies, piles of yellow Florida oranges, tangerines, sharp, acrid, nostalgic odors.",1
259,"Seated before a roast or a fowl, Gant began a heavy clangor on his steel and carving knife, distributing thereafter Gargantuan portions to each plate. Eugene feasted from a high chair by his father's side, filled his distending belly until it was drum-tight, and was permitted to stop eating by his watchful sire only when his stomach was impregnable to the heavy prod of Gant's big finger. There's a soft place there,"" he would roar, and he would cover the scoured plate of his infant son with another heavy slab of beef. That their machinery withstood this hammer-handed treatment was a tribute to their vitality and Eliza's cookery.",1
260,"Gant ate ravenously and without caution. He was immoderately fond of fish, and he invariably choked upon a bone while eating it. This happened hundreds of times, but each time he would look up suddenly with a howl of agony and terror, groaning and crying out strongly while a half-dozen hands pounded violently on his back.",1
261,"Merciful God! he would gasp finally, ""I thought I was done for that time. I'll vow, Mr. Gant,"" Eliza was vexed.",1
262,"Why on earth don't you watch what you're doing? If you didn't eat so fast you wouldn't always get choked. The children, staring, but relieved, settled slowly back in their places.",1
263,"He had a Dutch love of abundance: again and again he described the great stored barns, the groaning plenty of the Pennsylvanians. On his journey to California, he had been charmed in New Orleans by the cheapness and profusion of tropical fruits: a peddler offered him a great bunch of bananas for twenty-five cents, and Gant had taken them at once, wondering desperately later, as they moved across the continent, why, and what he was going to do with them. 7   This journey to California was Gant's last great voyage.",1
264,"He made it two years after Eliza's return from St. Louis, when he was fifty-six years old. In the great frame was already stirring the chemistry of pain and death. Unspoken and undefined there was in him the knowledge that he was at length caught in the trap of life and fixity, that he was being borne under in this struggle against the terrible will that wanted to own the earth more than to explore it. This was the final flare of the old hunger that had once darkened in the small gray eyes, leading a boy into new lands and toward the soft stone smile of an angel.",1
265,"And he returned from nine thousand miles of wandering, to the bleak bare prison of the hills on a gray day late in winter. In the more than eight thousand days and nights of this life with Eliza, how often had he been wakefully, soberly and peripatetically conscious of the world outside him between the hours of one and five A.M.? Wholly, for not more than nineteen nights--one for the birth of Leslie, Eliza's first daughter; one for her death twenty- six months later, cholera infantis; one for the death of Major Tom Pentland, Eliza's father, in May, 1902; one for the birth of Luke; one, on the train westbound to Saint Louis, en route to Grover's death; one for the death in the Playhouse (1893) of Uncle Thaddeus Evans, an aged and devoted negro; one, with Eliza, in the month of March, 1897, as deathwatch to the corpse of old Major Isaacs; three at the end of the month of July, 1897, when it was thought that Eliza, withered to a white sheeting of skin upon a bone frame, must die of typhoid; again in early April, 1903, for Luke, typhoid death near; one for the death of Greeley Pentland, aged twenty-six, congenial scrofulous tubercular, violinist, Pentlandian punster, petty check-forger, and six weeks' jailbird; three nights, from the eleventh to the fourteenth of January, 1905, by the rheumatic crucifixion of his right side, participant in his own grief, accuser of himself and his God; once in February, 1896, as death- watch to the remains of Sandy Duncan, aged eleven; once in September, 1895, penitentially alert and shamefast in the City ""calaboose""; in a room of the Keeley Institute at Piedmont, North Carolina, June 7, 1896; on March 17, 1906, between Knoxville, Tennessee, and Altamont, at the conclusion of a seven weeks' journey to California.",1
266,"How looked the home-earth then to Gant the Far-Wanderer? Light crept grayly, melting on the rocky river, the engine smoke streaked out on dawn like a cold breath, the hills were big, but nearer, nearer than he thought. And Altamont lay gray and withered in the hills, a bleak mean wintry dot. He stepped carefully down in squalid Toytown, noting that everything was low, near, and shrunken as he made his Gulliverian entry. He had a roof-and-gulley high conviction; with careful tucked-in elbows he weighted down the heated Toytown street-car, staring painfully at the dirty pasteboard pebbledash of the Pisgah Hotel, the brick and board cheap warehouses of Depot Street, the rusty clapboard flimsiness of the Florence (Railway Men's) Hotel, quaking with beef-fed harlotry.",1
267,"So small, so small, so small, he thought. I never believed it. Even the hills here. I'll soon be sixty.",1
268,"His sallow face, thin-flanked, was hang-dog and afraid. He stared wistful-sullenly down at the rattan seat as the car screeched round into the switch at the cut and stopped; the motorman, smoke- throated, slid the door back and entered with his handle. He closed the door and sat down yawning.",1
269,"Where you been, Mr. Gant?""  ""California,"" said Gant. Thought I hadn't seen you,"" said the motorman. There was a warm electric smell and one of hot burnt steel.",1
270,"But two months dead! But two months dead! Ah, Lord! So it's come to this. Merciful God, this fearful, awful, and damnable climate. Death, death! Is it too late? A land of life, a flower land. How clear the green clear sea was. And all the fishes swimming there. Santa Catalina. Those in the East should always go West. How came I here? Down, down--always down, did I know where? Baltimore, Sydney--In God's name, why? The little boat glass-bottomed, so you could look down. She lifted up her skirts as she stepped down. Where now? A pair of pippins.",1
271,"Jim Bowles died while you were gone, I reckon,"" said the motorman. What!"" howled Gant. Merciful God! he clucked mournfully downward. What did he die of?"" he asked.",1
272,"Pneumonia,"" said the motorman. He was dead four days after he was took down. Why, he was a big healthy man in the prime of life,"" said Gant.",1
273,"I was talking to him the day before I went away,"" he lied, convincing himself permanently that this was true. He looked as if he had never known a day's sickness in his life. He went home one Friday night with a chill,"" said the motorman, ""and the next Tuesday he was gone.",1
274,There was a crescent humming on the rails. With his thick glove finger he pushed away a clearing in the window-coated ice scurf and looked smokily out on the raw red cut-bank. The other car appeared abruptly at the end of the cut and curved with a skreeking jerk into the switch.,1
275,"No, sir,"" said the motorman, sliding back the door, ""you never know who'll go next. Here to-day and gone to-morrow. Hit gits the big 'uns first sometimes. He closed the door behind him and jerkily opened three notches of juice.",1
276,"The car ground briskly off like a wound toy. In the prime of life, thought Gant. Myself like that some day. No, for others. Mother almost eighty-six.  Eats like a horse, Augusta wrote. Must send her twenty dollars. Now in the cold clay, frozen. Keep till Spring. Rain, rot, rain. Who got the job? Brock or Saul Gudger? Bread out of my mouth. Do me to death--the stranger. Georgia marble, sandstone base, forty dollars.",1
277,"A gracious friend from us is gone,       A voice we loved is fled,       But faith and memory lead us on:       He lives; he is not dead. Four cents a letter. Little enough, God knows, for the work you do. My letters the best. Could have been a writer. Like to draw too. And all of mine! I would have heard if anything--he would have told me. I'll never go that way. All right above the waist. If anything happens it will be down below. Eaten away. Whisky holes through all your guts. Pictures in Cardiac's office of man with cancer. But several doctors have to agree on it. Criminal offense if they don't. But, if worst comes to worst--all that's outside. Get it before it gets up in you. Still live. Old man Haight had a flap in his belly. Ladled it out in a cup. McGuire-- damned butcher. But he can do anything. Cut off a piece here, sew it on there. Made the Hominy man a nose with a piece of shinbone. Couldn't tell it. Ought to be possible. Cut all the strings, tie them up again. While you wait. Sort of job for McGuire--rough and ready. They'll do it some day. After I'm gone. Things standing thus, unknown--but kill you maybe. Bull's too big. Soon now the Spring. You'd die. Not big enough. All bloody in her brain. Full filling fountains of bull-milk. Jupiter and what's-her-name.",1
278,"But westward now he caught a glimpse of Pisgah and the western range. It was more spacious there. The hills climbed sunward to the sun. There was width to the eye, a smoking sun-hazed amplitude, the world convoluting and opening into the world, hill and plain, into the west. The West for desire, the East for home. To the east the short near mile-away hills reeked protectively above the town. Birdseye, Sunset. A straight plume of smoke coiled thickly from Judge Buck Sevier's smut-white clapboard residence on the decent side of Pisgah Avenue, thin smoke-wisps rose from the nigger shacks in the ravine below. Breakfast. Fried brains and eggs with streaky rashers of limp bacon. Wake, wake, wake, you mountain grills! Sleeps she yet, wrapped dirtily in three old wrappers in stale, airless yellow-shaded cold. The chapped hands sick-sweet glycerined. Gum-headed bottles, hairpins, and the bits of string. No one may enter now. Ashamed.",1
279,"A paper-carrier, number 7, finished his route on the corner of Vine Street, as the car stopped, turned eastwards now from Pisgah Avenue toward the town core. The boy folded, bent, and flattened the fresh sheets deftly, throwing the block angularly thirty yards upon the porch of Shields the jeweller; it struck the boarding and bounded back with a fresh plop. Then he walked off with fatigued relief into time toward the twentieth century, feeling gratefully the ghost-kiss of absent weight upon his now free but still leaning right shoulder.",1
280,"About fourteen, thought Gant. That would be Spring of 1864. The mule camp at Harrisburg. Thirty a month and keep. Men stank worse than mules. I was in third bunk on top. Gil in second. Keep your damned dirty hoof out of my mouth. It's bigger than a mule's. That was the man. If it ever lands on you, you bastard, you'll think it is a mule's, said Gil. Then they had it. Mother made us go. Big enough to work, she said. Born at the heart of the world, why here? Twelve miles from Gettysburg. Out of the South they came. Stove-pipe hats they had stolen. No shoes. Give me a drink, son. That was Fitzhugh Lee. After the third day we went over. Devil's Den.  Cemetery Ridge. Stinking piles of arms and legs. Some of it done with meat-saws. Is the land richer now? The great barns bigger than the houses. Big eaters, all of us. I hid the cattle in the thicket. Belle Boyd, the Beautiful Rebel Spy.  Sentenced to be shot four times. Took the despatches from his pocket while they danced. Probably a little chippie.  Hog-chitlins and hot cracklin' bread.",1
281,Must get some. The whole hog or none. Always been a good provider. Little I ever had done for me.,1
282,"The car still climbing, mounted the flimsy cheap-boarded brown-gray smuttiness of Skyland Avenue. America's Switzerland. The Beautiful Land of the Sky. Jesus God! Old Bowman said he'll be a rich man some day. Built up all the way to Pasadena. Come on out. Too late now. Think he was in love with her. No matter. Too old. Wants her out there. No fool like--White bellies of the fish. A spring somewhere to wash me through. Clean as a baby once more. New Orleans, the night Jim Corbett knocked out John L. Sullivan. The man who tried to rob me. My clothes and my watch. Five blocks down Canal Street in my nightgown. Two A.M.  Threw them all in a heap--watch landed on top. Fight in my room. Town full of crooks and pickpockets for prizefight. Make good story. Policeman half hour later. They come out and beg you to come in. Frenchwomen. Creoles. Beautiful Creole heiress. Steamboat race. Captain, they are gaining. I will not be beaten. Out of wood. Use the bacon she said proudly. There was a terrific explosion. He got her as she sank the third time and swam to shore. They powder in front of the window, smacking their lips at you. For old men better maybe. Who gets the business there? Bury them all above ground. Water two feet down. Rots them. Why not? All big jobs. Italy. Carrara and Rome. Yet Brutus is an hon-or-able man. What's a Creole? French and Spanish. Has she any nigger blood? Ask Cardiac?",1
283,"The car paused briefly at the car-shed, in sight of its stabled brothers. Then it moved reluctantly past the dynamic atmosphere of the Power and Light Company, wheeling bluntly into the gray frozen ribbon of Hatton Avenue, running gently up hill near its end into the frore silence of the Square. Ah, Lord! Well do I remember. The old man offered me the whole piece for $1,000 three days after I arrived. Millionaire to-day if--  The car passed the Tuskegee on its eighty-yard climb into the Square.",1
284,"The fat slick worn leather-chairs marshalled between a fresh-rubbed gleaming line of brass spittoons squatted massively on each side of the entry door, before thick sheets of plate-glass that extended almost to the sidewalks with indecent nearness. Many a fat man's rump upon the leather. Like fish in a glass case. Travelling man's wet chewed cigar, spit-limp on his greasy lips. Staring at all the women. Can't look back long. Gives advantage.",1
285,"A negro bellboy sleepily wafted a gray dust-cloth across the leather. Within, before the replenished crackle-dance of the wood- fire, the nightclerk sprawled out in the deep receiving belly of a leather divan. The car reached the Square, jolted across the netting of north- south lines, and came to a halt on the north side, facing east. Scurfing a patch away from the glazed window, Gant looked out. The Square in the wan-gray frozen morning walled round him with frozen unnatural smallness. He felt suddenly the cramped mean fixity of the Square: this was the one fixed spot in a world that writhed, evolved, and changed constantly in his vision, and he felt a sick green fear, a frozen constriction about his heart because the centre of his life now looked so shrunken. He got very definitely the impression that if he flung out his arms they would strike against the walls of the mean three-and-four-story brickbuilt buildings that flanked the Square raggedly.",1
286,"Anchored to earth at last, he was hit suddenly by the whole cumulation of sight and movement, of eating, drinking, and acting that had gathered in him for two months. The limitless land, wood, field, hill, prairie, desert, mountain, the coast rushing away below his eyes, the ground that swam before his eyes at stations, the remembered ghosts of gumbo, oysters, huge Frisco seasteaks, tropical fruits swarmed with the infinite life, the ceaseless pullulation of the sea. Here only, in his unreal-reality, this unnatural vision of what he had known for twenty years, did life lose its movement, change, color.",1
287,"The Square had the horrible concreteness of a dream. At the far southeastern edge he saw his shop: his name painted hugely in dirty scaly white across the brick near the roof:  W. O. Gant--Marbles, Tombstones, Cemetery Fixtures. It was like a dream of hell, when a man finds his own name staring at him from the Devil's ledger; like a dream of death, when he who comes as mourner finds himself in the coffin, or as witness to a hanging, the condemned upon the scaffold.",1
288,"A sleepy negro employed at the Manor Hotel clambered heavily up and slumped into one of the seats reserved for his race at the back. In a moment he began to snore gently through his blubbered lips. At the east end of the Square, Big Bill Messler, with his vest half-unbuttoned over his girdled paunch-belly, descended slowly the steps of the City Hall, and moved soundingly off with country leisure along the cold-metallic sidewalk. The fountain, ringed with a thick bracelet of ice, played at quarter-strength a sheening glut of ice-blue water.",1
289,"Cars droned separately into their focal positions; the carmen stamped their feet and talked smokily together; there was a breath of beginning life. Beside the City Hall, the firemen slept above their wagons: behind the bolted door great hoofs drummed woodenly. A dray rattled across the east end of the Square before the City Hall, the old horse leaning back cautiously as he sloped down into the dray market by the oblique cobbled passage at the southeast that cut Gant's shop away from the market and ""calaboose. As the car moved eastward again, Gant caught an angular view of Niggertown across this passage. The settlement was plumed delicately with a hundred tiny fumes of smoke.",1
290,"The car sloped swiftly now down Academy Street, turned, as the upper edge of the negro settlement impinged steeply from the valley upon the white, into Ivy Street, and proceeded north along a street bordered on one side by smutty pebble-dash cottages, and on the other by a grove of lordly oaks, in which the large quaking plaster pile of old Professor Bowman's deserted School for Young Ladies loomed desolately, turning and stopping at the corner, at the top of the Woodson Street hill, by the great wintry, wooden, and deserted barn of the Ivy Hotel. It had never paid. Gant kneed his heavy bag before him down the passage, depositing it for a moment at the curbing before he descended the hill. The unpaved frozen clay fell steeply and lumpily away. It was steeper, shorter, nearer than he thought. Only the trees looked large. He saw Duncan come out on his porch, shirtsleeved, and pick up the morning paper. Speak to him later. Too long now. As he expected, there was a fat coil of morning smoke above the Scotchman's chimney, but none from his own.",1
291,"He went down the hill, opening his iron gate softly, and going around to the side entrance by the yard, rather than ascend the steep veranda steps. The grape vines, tough and barren, writhed about the house like sinewy ropes. He entered the sitting-room quietly. There was a strong odor of cold leather. Cold ashes were strewn thinly in the grate. He put his bag down and went back through the wash-room into the kitchen. Eliza, wearing one of his old coats, and a pair of fingerless woollen gloves, poked among the embers of a crawling little fire.",1
292,"Well, I'm back,"" Gant said. Why, what on earth! she cried as he knew she would, becoming flustered and moving her arms indeterminately. He laid his hand clumsily on her shoulder for a moment. They stood awkwardly without movement. Then he seized the oil-can, and drenched the wood with kerosene. The flame roared up out of the stove.",1
293,"Mercy, Mr. Gant,"" cried Eliza, ""you'll burn us up! But, seizing a handful of cut sticks and the oil-can, he lunged furiously toward the sitting-room. As the flame shot roaring up from the oiled pine sticks, and he felt the fire-full chimney-throat tremble, he recovered joy. He brought back the width of the desert; the vast yellow serpent of the river, alluvial with the mined accretions of the continent; the rich vision of laden ships, masted above the sea-walls, the world- nostalgic ships, bearing about them the filtered and concentrated odors of the earth, sensual negroid rum and molasses, tar, ripening guavas, bananas, tangerines, pineapples in the warm holds of tropical boats, as cheap, as profuse, as abundant as the lazy equatorial earth and all its women; the great names of Louisiana, Texas, Arizona, Colorado, California; the blasted fiend-world of the desert, and the terrific boles of trees, tunnelled for the passage of a coach; water that fell from a mountain-top in a smoking noiseless coil, internal boiling lakes flung skywards by the punctual respiration of the earth, the multitudinous torture in form of granite oceans, gouged depthlessly by canyons, and iridescent with the daily chameleon-shift beyond man, beyond nature, of terrific colors, below the un-human iridescence of the sky.",1
294,"Eliza, still excited, recovering speech, followed him into the sitting-room, holding her chapped gloved hands clasped before her stomach while she talked. I was saying to Steve last night, 'It wouldn't surprise me if your papa would come rolling in at any minute now'--I just had a feeling, I don't know what you'd call it,"" she said, her face plucked inward by the sudden fabrication of legend, ""but it's pretty strange when you come to think of it. I was in Garret's the other day ordering some things, some vanilla extract, soda and a pound of coffee when Aleck Carter came up to me. 'Eliza,' he said, 'when's Mr. Gant coming back--I think I may have a job for him?' 'Why, Aleck,' I said, 'I don't much expect him before the first of April.' Well, sir, what do you know--I had no sooner got out on the street--I suppose I must have been thinking of something else, because I remember Emma Aldrich came by and hollered to me and I didn't think to answer her until she had gone on by, so I called out just as big as you please to her, 'Emma!'--the thing flashed over me all of a sudden--I was just as sure of it as I'm standing here--'what do you think? Mr. Gant's on his way back home'. Jesus God! thought Gant.",1
295,"It's begun again. Her memory moved over the ocean-bed of event like a great octopus, blindly but completely feeling its way into every seacave, rill, and estuary, focussed on all she had done, felt and thought, with sucking Pentlandian intentness, for whom the sun shone, or grew dark, rain fell, and mankind came, spoke, and died, shifted for a moment in time out of its void into the Pentlandian core, pattern and heart of purpose. Meanwhile, as he laid big gleaming lumps of coal upon the wood, he muttered to himself, his mind ordering in a mounting sequence, with balanced and climactic periods, his carefully punctuated rhetoric.",1
296,"Yes, musty cotton, bated and piled under long sheds of railway sidings; and odorous pine woodlands of the level South, saturated with brown faery light, and broken by the tall straight leafless poles of trees; a woman's leg below an elegantly lifted skirt mounting to a carriage in Canal Street (French or Creole probably); a white arm curved reaching for a window shade, French-olive faces window-glimmering, the Georgia doctor's wife who slept above him going out, the unquenchable fish-filled abundance of the unfenced, blue, slow cat-slapping lazy Pacific; and the river, the all- drinking, yellow, slow-surging snake that drained the continent. His life was like that river, rich with its own deposited and onward-borne agglutinations, fecund with its sedimental accretions, filled exhaustlessly by life in order to be more richly itself, and this life, with the great purpose of a river, he emptied now into the harbor of his house, the sufficient haven of himself, for whom the gnarled vines wove round him thrice, the earth burgeoned with abundant fruit and blossom, the fire burnt madly. What have you got for breakfast? he said to Eliza.",1
297,"Why,"" she said, pursing her lips meditatively, ""would you like some eggs? Yes,"" said he, ""with a few rashers of bacon and a couple of pork sausages. He strode across the dining-room and went up the hall.",1
298,Steve! Ben!  Luke! You damned scoundrels! he yelled. Get up!,1
299,Their feet thudded almost simultaneously upon the floor. Papa's home! they shrieked.,1
300,"Mr. Duncan watched butter soak through a new-baked roll. He looked through his curtain angularly down, and saw thick acrid smoke biting heavily into the air above Gant's house. He's back,"" said he, with satisfaction.",1
301,"So, at the moment looking, Tarkinton of the paints said:  ""W. O.'s back. Thus came he home, who had put out to land westward, Gant the Far- Wanderer. 8   Eugene was loose now in the limitless meadows of sensation: his sensory equipment was so complete that at the moment of perception of a single thing, the whole background of color, warmth, odor, sound, taste established itself, so that later, the breath of hot dandelion brought back the grass-warm banks of Spring, a day, a place, the rustling of young leaves, or the page of a book, the thin exotic smell of tangerine, the wintry bite of great apples; or, as with Gulliver's Travels, a bright windy day in March, the spurting moments of warmth, the drip and reek of the earth-thaw, the feel of the fire.",1
302,"He had won his first release from the fences of home--he was not quite six, when, of his own insistence, he went to school. Eliza did not want him to go, but his only close companion, Max Isaacs, a year his senior, was going, and there was in his heart a constricting terror that he would be left alone again. She told him he could not go: she felt, somehow, that school began the slow, the final loosening of the cords that held them together, but as she saw him slide craftily out the gate one morning in September and run at top speed to the corner where the other little boy was waiting, she did nothing to bring him back. Something taut snapped in her; she remembered his furtive backward glance, and she wept. And she did not weep for herself, but for him: the hour after his birth she had looked in his dark eyes and had seen something that would brood there eternally, she knew, unfathomable wells of remote and intangible loneliness: she knew that in her dark and sorrowful womb a stranger had come to life, fed by the lost communications of eternity, his own ghost, haunter of his own house, lonely to himself and to the world. O lost.",1
303,"Busy with the ache of their own growing pains, his brothers and sisters had little time for him: he was almost six years younger than Luke, the youngest of them, but they exerted over him the occasional small cruelties, petty tormentings by elder children of a younger, interested and excited by the brief screaming insanity of his temper when, goaded and taunted from some deep dream, he would seize a carving knife and pursue them, or batter his head against the walls. They felt that he was ""queer""--the other boys preached the smug cowardice of the child-herd, defending themselves, when their persecutions were discovered, by saying they would make a ""real boy"" of him. But there grew up in him a deep affection for Ben who stalked occasionally and softly through the house, guarding even then with scowling eyes, and surly speech, the secret life. Ben was a stranger: some deep instinct drew him to his child-brother, a portion of his small earnings as a paper-carrier he spent in gifts and amusement for Eugene, admonishing him sullenly, cuffing him occasionally, but defending him before the others.",1
304,"Gant, as he watched his brooding face set for hours before a firelit book of pictures, concluded that the boy liked books, more vaguely, that he would make a lawyer of him, send him into politics, see him elected to the governorship, the Senate, the presidency. And he unfolded to him time after time all the rude American legendry of the country boys who became great men because they were country boys, poor boys, and hard-working farm boys. But Eliza thought of him as a scholar, a learned man, a professor, and with that convenient afterthought that annoyed Gant so deeply, but by which she firmly convinced herself, she saw in this book-brooder the fruit of her own deliberate design.",1
305,"I read every moment I could get the chance the summer before he was born,"" she said. And then, with a complacent and confidential smile which, Gant knew, always preceded some reference to her family, she said:  ""I tell you what: it may all come out in the Third Generation. The Third Generation be Goddamned!",1
306,"answered Gant furiously. Now, I want to tell you,"" she went on thoughtfully, speaking with her forefinger, ""folks have always said that his grandfather would have made a fine scholar if--""  ""Merciful God!"" said Gant, getting up suddenly and striding about the room with an ironical laugh. I might have known that it would come to this! You may be sure,"" he exclaimed in high excitement, wetting his thumb briefly on his tongue, ""that if there's any credit to be given I won't get it. Not from you! You'd rather die than admit it! No, but I'll tell you what you will do! You'll brag about that miserable old freak who never did a hard day's work in his life. Now, I wouldn't be so sure of that if I were you,"" Eliza began, her lips working rapidly.",1
307,"Jesus God! he cried, flinging about the room with his customary indifference to reasoned debate. Jesus God! What a travesty! A travesty on Nature! Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned! he exclaimed, indefinitely but violently, and then as he strode about, he gave way to loud, bitter, forced laughter.",1
308,"Thus, pent in his dark soul, Eugene sat brooding on a fire-lit book, a stranger in a noisy inn. The gates of his life were closing him in from their knowledge, a vast aerial world of fantasy was erecting its fuming and insubstantial fabric. He steeped his soul in streaming imagery, rifling the book-shelves for pictures and finding there such treasures as With Stanley in Africa, rich in the mystery of the jungle, alive with combat, black battle, the hurled spear, vast snake-rooted forests, thatched villages, gold and ivory; or Stoddard's Lectures, on whose slick heavy pages were stamped the most-visited scenes of Europe and Asia; a Book of Wonder, with enchanting drawings of all the marvels of the age-- Santos Dumont and his balloon, liquid air poured from a kettle, all the navies of the earth lifted two feet from the water by an ounce of radium (Sir William Crookes), the building of the Eiffel Tower, the Flatiron Building, the stick-steered automobile, the submarine. After the earthquake in San Francisco there was a book describing it, its cheap green cover lurid with crumbling towers, shaken spires, toppling many-storied houses plunging into the splitting flame-jawed earth. And there was another called Palaces of Sin, or The Devil in Society, purporting to be the work of a pious millionaire, who had drained his vast fortune in exposing the painted sores that blemish the spotless-seeming hide of great position, and there were enticing pictures showing the author walking in a silk hat down a street full of magnificent palaces of sin.",1
309,"Out of this strange jumbled gallery of pictures the pieced-out world was expanding under the brooding power of his imagination: the lost dark angels of the Doré ""Milton"" swooped into cavernous Hell beyond this upper earth of soaring or toppling spires, machine wonder, maced and mailed romance. And, as he thought of his future liberation into this epic world, where all the color of life blazed brightest far away from home, his heart flooded his face with lakes of blood. He had heard already the ringing of remote church bells over a countryside on Sunday night; had listened to the earth steeped in the brooding of dark, and the million-noted little night things; and he had heard thus the far retreating wail of a whistle in a distant valley, and faint thunder on the rails; and he felt the infinite depth and width of the golden world in the brief seductions of a thousand multiplex and mixed mysterious odors and sensations, weaving, with a blinding interplay and aural explosions, one into the other.",1
310,"He remembered yet the East India Tea House at the Fair, the sandalwood, the turbans, and the robes, the cool interior and the smell of India tea; and he had felt now the nostalgic thrill of dew-wet mornings in Spring, the cherry scent, the cool clarion earth, the wet loaminess of the garden, the pungent breakfast smells and the floating snow of blossoms. He knew the inchoate sharp excitement of hot dandelions in young Spring grass at noon; the smell of cellars, cobwebs, and built-on secret earth; in July, of watermelons bedded in sweet hay, inside a farmer's covered wagon; of cantaloupe and crated peaches; and the scent of orange rind, bittersweet, before a fire of coals. He knew the good male smell of his father's sitting-room; of the smooth worn leather sofa, with the gaping horse-hair rent; of the blistered varnished wood upon the hearth; of the heated calf-skin bindings; of the flat moist plug of apple tobacco, stuck with a red flag; of wood-smoke and burnt leaves in October; of the brown tired autumn earth; of honey-suckle at night; of warm nasturtiums; of a clean ruddy farmer who comes weekly with printed butter, eggs and milk; of fat limp underdone bacon and of coffee; of a bakery-oven in the wind; of large deep-hued stringbeans smoking-hot and seasoned well with salt and butter; of a room of old pine boards in which books and carpets have been stored, long closed; of Concord grapes in their long white baskets.",1
311,"Yes, and the exciting smell of chalk and varnished desks; the smell of heavy bread-sandwiches of cold fried meat and butter; the smell of new leather in a saddler's shop, or of a warm leather chair; of honey and of unground coffee; of barrelled sweet-pickles and cheese and all the fragrant compost of the grocer's; the smell of stored apples in the cellar, and of orchard-apple smells, of pressed-cider pulp; of pears ripening on a sunny shelf, and of ripe cherries stewing with sugar on hot stoves before preserving; the smell of whittled wood, of all young lumber, of sawdust and shavings; of peaches stuck with cloves and pickled in brandy; of pine-sap, and green pine-needles; of a horse's pared hoof; of chestnuts roasting, of bowls of nuts and raisins; of hot cracklin, and of young roast pork; of butter and cinnamon melting on hot candied yams. Yes, and of the rank slow river, and of tomatoes rotten on the vine; the smell of rain-wet plums and boiling quinces; of rotten lily-pads; and of foul weeds rotting in green marsh scum; and the exquisite smell of the South, clean but funky, like a big woman; of soaking trees and the earth after heavy rain. Yes, and the smell of hot daisy-fields in the morning; of melted puddling-iron in a foundry; the winter smell of horse-warm stables and smoking dung; of old oak and walnut; and the butcher's smell of meat, of strong slaughtered lamb, plump gouty liver, ground pasty sausages, and red beef; and of brown sugar melted with slivered bitter chocolate; and of crushed mint leaves, and of a wet lilac bush; of magnolia beneath the heavy moon, of dogwood and laurel; of an old caked pipe and Bourbon rye, aged in kegs of charred oak; the sharp smell of tobacco; of carbolic and nitric acids; the coarse true smell of a dog; of old imprisoned books; and the cool fern- smell near springs; of vanilla in cake-dough; and of cloven ponderous cheeses.",1
312,"Yes, and of a hardware store, but mostly the good smell of nails; of the developing chemicals in a photographer's dark-room; and the young-life smell of paint and turpentine; of buckwheat batter and black sorghum; and of a negro and his horse, together; of boiling fudge; the brine smell of pickling vats; and the lush undergrowth smell of southern hills; of a slimy oyster-can, of chilled gutted fish; of a hot kitchen negress; of kerosene and linoleum; of sarsaparilla and guavas; and of ripe autumn persimmons; and the smell of the wind and the rain; and of the acrid thunder; of cold starlight, and the brittle-bladed frozen grass; of fog and the misted winter sun; of seed-time, bloom, and mellow dropping harvest. And now, whetted intemperately by what he had felt, he began, at school, in that fecund romance, the geography, to breathe the mixed odors of the earth, sensing in every squat keg piled on a pier-head a treasure of golden rum, rich port, fat Burgundy; smelling the jungle growth of the tropics, the heavy odor of plantations, the salt-fish smell of harbors, voyaging in the vast, enchanting, but unperplexing world. Now the innumerable archipelago had been threaded, and he stood, firm-planted, upon the unknown but waiting continent.",1
313,"He learned to read almost at once, printing the shapes of words immediately with his strong visual memory; but it was weeks later before he learned to write, or even to copy, words. The ragged spume and wrack of fantasy and the lost world still floated from time to time through his clear school-day morning brain, and although he followed accurately all the other instruction of his teacher, he was walled in his ancient unknowing world when they made letters. The children made their sprawling alphabets below a line of models, but all he accomplished was a line of jagged wavering spear-points on his sheet, which he repeated endlessly and rapturously, unable to see or understand the difference.",1
314,"I have learned to write,"" he thought. Then, one day, Max Isaacs looked suddenly, from his exercise, on Eugene's sheet, and saw the jagged line. That ain't writin',"" said he.",1
315,"And clubbing his pencil in his waited grimy hand, he scrawled a copy of the exercise across the page. The line of life, that beautiful developing structure of language that he saw flowing from his comrade's pencil, cut the knot in him that all instruction failed to do, and instantly he seized the pencil, and wrote the words in letters fairer and finer than his friend's. And he turned, with a cry in his throat, to the next page, and copied it without hesitation, and the next, the next. They looked at each other a moment with that clear wonder by which children accept miracles, and they never spoke of it again.",1
316,"That's writin' now,"" said Max. But they kept the mystery caged between them. Eugene thought of this event later; always he could feel the opening gates in him, the plunge of the tide, the escape; out it happened like this one day at once. Still midget-near the live pelt of the earth, he saw many things that he kept in fearful secret, knowing that revelation would be punished with ridicule. One Saturday in Spring, he stopped with Max Isaacs above a deep pit in Central Avenue where city workmen were patching a broken watermain. The clay walls of their pit were much higher than their heads; behind their huddled backs there was a wide fissure, a window in the earth which opened on some dark subterranean passage. And as the boys looked, they gripped each other suddenly, for past the fissure slid the flat head of an enormous serpent; passed, and was followed by a scaled body as thick as a man's; the monster slid endlessly on into the deep earth and vanished behind the working and unwitting men. Shaken with fear they went away, they talked about it then and later in hushed voices, but they never revealed it.",1
317,"He fell now easily into the School-Ritual; he choked his breakfast with his brothers every morning, gulped scalding coffee, and rushed off at the ominous warning of the final bell, clutching a hot paper-bag of food, already spattered hungrily with grease blots. He pounded along after his brothers, his heart hammering in his throat with excitement and, as he raced into the hollow at the foot of the Central Avenue hill, grew weak with nervousness, as he heard the bell ringing itself to sleep, jerking the slatting rope about in its dying echoes. Ben, grinning evilly and scowling, would thrust his hand against the small of his back and rush him screaming, but unable to resist the plunging force behind, up the hill.",1
318,"In a gasping voice he would sing the morning song, coming in pantingly on the last round of a song the quartered class took up at intervals:        ""--Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,       Life is but a dream.  Or, in the frosty Autumn mornings:        ""Waken, lords and ladies gay,       On the mountain dawns the day.",1
319,"Or the Contest of the West Wind and the South Wind. Or the Miller's Song:        ""I envy no man, no, not I,       And no one envies me. He read quickly and easily; he spelled accurately.",1
320,"He did well with figures. But he hated the drawing lesson, although the boxes of crayons and paints delighted him. Sometimes the class would go into the woods, returning with specimens of flowers and leaves--the bitten flaming red of the maple, the brown pine comb, the brown oak leaf. These they would paint; or in Spring a spray of cherry- blossom, a tulip. He sat reverently before the authority of the plump woman who first taught him: he was terrified lest he do anything common or mean in her eyes.",1
321,"The class squirmed: the little boys invented tortures or scrawled obscenities to the little girls. And the wilder and more indolent seized every chance of leaving the room, thus:  ""Teacher, may I be excused? And they would go out into the lavatory, sniggering and dawdling about restlessly.",1
322,"He could never say it, because it would reveal to her the shame of nature. Once, deathly sick, but locked in silence and dumb nausea, he had vomited finally upon his cupped hands. He feared and hated the recess periods, trembled before the brawling confusion of the mob and the playground, but his pride forbade that he skulk within, or secrete himself away from them. Eliza had allowed his hair to grow long; she wound it around her finger every morning into fat Fauntleroy curls; the agony and humiliation it caused him was horrible, but she was unable or unwilling to understand it, and mouth-pursingly thoughtful and stubborn to all solicitation to cut it. She had the garnered curls of Ben, Grover, and Luke stored in tiny boxes: she wept sometimes when she saw Eugene's, they were the symbol of his babyhood to her, and her sad heart, so keen in marking departures, refused to surrender them. Even when his thick locks had become the luxuriant colony of Harry Tarkinton's lice, she would not cut them: she held his squirming body between her knees twice a day and ploughed his scalp with a fine-toothed comb.",1
323,"As he made to her his trembling passionate entreaties, she would smile with an affectation of patronizing humor, make a bantering humming noise in her throat, and say:  ""Why, say--you can't grow up yet. You're my baby. Suddenly baffled before the yielding inflexibility of her nature, which could be driven to action only after incessant and maddening prods, Eugene, screaming-mad with helpless fury, would understand the cause of Gant's frenzy.",1
324,"At school, he was a desperate and hunted little animal. The herd, infallible in its banded instinct, knew at once that a stranger had been thrust into it, and it was merciless at the hunt. As the lunch-time recess came, Eugene, clutching his big grease-stained bag, would rush for the playground pursued by the yelping pack. The leaders, two or three big louts of advanced age and deficient mentality, pressed closely about him, calling out suppliantly, ""You know me, 'Gene. You know me""; and still racing for the far end, he would open his bag and hurl to them one of his big sandwiches, which stayed them for a moment, as they fell upon its possessor and clawed it to fragments, but they were upon him in a moment more with the same yelping insistence, hunting him down into a corner of the fence, and pressing in with outstretched paws and wild entreaty. He would give them what he had, sometimes with a momentary gust of fury, tearing away from a greedy hand half of a sandwich and devouring it. When they saw he had no more to give, they went away.",1
325,"The great fantasy of Christmas still kept him devout. Gant was his unwearied comrade; night after night in the late autumn and early winter, he would scrawl petitions to Santa Claus, listing interminably the gifts he wanted most, and transmitting each, with perfect trust, to the roaring chimney. As the flame took the paper from his hand and blew its charred ghost away with a howl, Gant would rush with him to the window, point to the stormy northern sky, and say:  ""There it goes! Do you see it?""  He saw it.",1
326,"He saw his prayer, winged with the stanch convoying winds, borne northward to the rimed quaint gabels of Toyland, into frozen merry Elfland; heard the tiny silver anvil-tones, the deep- lunged laughter of the little men, the stabled cries of aerial reindeer. Gant saw and heard them, too. He was liberally dowered with bright-painted gimcracks upon Christmas Day; and in his heart he hated those who advocated ""useful"" gifts. Gant bought him wagons, sleds, drums, horns--best of all, a small fireman's ladder wagon: it was the wonder, and finally the curse, of the neighborhood. During his unoccupied hours, he lived for months in the cellar with Harry Tarkinton and Max Isaacs: they strung the ladders on wires above the wagon, so that, at a touch, they would fall in accurate stacks. They would pretend to doze in their quarters, as firemen do, would leap to action suddenly, as one of them imitated the warning bell: Clang- a-lang-a-lang. Then, quite beyond reason, Harry and Max yoked in a plunging team, Eugene in the driver's seat, they would leap out through the narrow door, gallop perilously to a neighbor's house, throw up ladders, open windows, effect entries, extinguish imaginary flames, and return oblivious to the shrieking indictment of the housewife.",1
327,"For months they lived completely in this fantasy, modelling their actions on those of the town's firemen, and on Jannadeau, who was the assistant chief, child-proud over it: they had seen him, at the sound of the alarm, rush like a madman from his window in Gant's shop, leaving the spattered fragments of a watch upon his desk, and arriving at his duty just as the great wagon hurtled at full speed into the Square. The firemen loved to stage the most daring exhibitions before the gaping citizenry; helmeted magnificently, they hung from the wagons in gymnastic postures, one man holding another over rushing space, while number two caught in mid-air the diving heavy body of the Swiss, who deliberately risked his neck as he leaped for the rail. Thus, for one rapturous moment they stood poised triangularly over rocking speed: the spine of the town was chilled ecstatically.",1
328,"And when the bells broke through the drowning winds at night, his demon rushed into his heart, bursting all cords that held him to the earth, promising him isolation and dominance over sea and land, inhabitation of the dark: he looked down on the whirling disk of dark forest and field, sloped over singing pines upon a huddled town, and carried its grated guarded fires against its own roofs, swerving and pouncing with his haltered storm upon their doomed and flaming walls, howling with thin laughter above their stricken heads and, fiend-voiced, calling down the bullet wind. Or, holding in fief the storm and the dark and all the black powers of wizardry, to gaze, ghoul-visaged, through a storm-lashed windowpane, briefly planting unutterable horror in grouped and sheltered life; or, no more than a man, but holding, in your more than mortal heart, demoniac ecstasy, to crouch against a lonely storm-swept house, to gaze obliquely through the streaming glass upon a woman, or your enemy, and while still exulting in your victorious dark all-seeing isolation, to feel a touch upon your shoulder, and to look, haunter-haunted, pursuer-pursued, into the green corrupted hell-face of malignant death. Yes, and a world of bedded women, fair glimmers in the panting darkness, while winds shook the house, and he arrived across the world between the fragrant columns of delight. The great mystery of their bodies groped darkly in him, but he had found there, at the school, instructors to desire--the hair-faced louts of Doubleday. They struck fear and wonder into the hearts of the smaller, gentler boys, for Doubleday was that infested region of the town-grown mountaineers, who lurked viciously through the night, and came at Hallowe'en to break the skulls of other gangs in rock warfare.",1
329,"There was a boy named Otto Krause, a cheese-nosed, hair-faced, inch-browed German boy, lean and swift in the legs, hoarse-voiced and full of idiot laughter, who showed him the gardens of delight. There was a girl named Bessie Barnes, a black-haired, tall, bold- figured girl of thirteen years who acted as model. Otto Krause was fourteen, Eugene was eight: they were in the third grade. The German boy sat next to him, drew obscenities on his books, and passed his furtive scrawled indecencies across the aisle to Bessie.",1
330,"And the nymph would answer with a lewd face, and a contemptuous blow against her shapely lifted buttock, a gesture which Otto considered as good as a promise, and which tickled him into hoarse sniggers. Bessie walked in his brain. In their furtive moments at school, he and Otto amused each other by drawing obscenities in their geographies, bestowing on the representations of tropical natives sagging breasts and huge organs. And they composed on tiny scraps of paper dirty little rhymes about teachers and principal. Their teacher was a gaunt red-faced spinster, with fierce glaring eyes: Eugene thought always of the soldier and the tinder and the dogs he had to pass, with eyes like saucers, windmills, the moon. Her name was Miss Groody, and Otto, with the idiot vulgarity of little boys, wrote of her:        ""Old Miss Groody       Has Good Toody.",1
331,"And Eugene, directing his fire against the principal, a plump, soft, foppish young man whose name was Armstrong, and who wore always a carnation in his coat, which, after whipping an offending boy, he was accustomed to hold delicately between his fingers, sniffing it with sensitive nostrils and lidded eyes, produced in the first rich joy of creation scores of rhymes, all to the discredit of Armstrong, his parentage, and his relations with Miss Groody. He was obsessed; he spent the entire day now in the composition of poetry--all bawdy variations of a theme. And he could not bring himself to destroy them. His desk was stuffed with tiny crumpled balls of writing: one day, during the geography lesson, the woman caught him. His bones turned to rubber as she bore down on him glaring, and took from the concealing pages of his book the paper on which he had been writing. At recess she cleared his desk, read the sequence, and, with boding quietness, bade him to see the principal after school.",1
332,What does it mean? What do you reckon it means? he whispered dryly to Otto Krause.,1
333,"Oh, you'll ketch it now!"" said Otto Krause, laughing hoarsely. And the class tormented him slily, rubbing their bottoms when they caught his eye, and making grimaces of agony. He was sick through to his guts. He had a loathing of physical humiliation which was not based on fear, from which he never recovered. The brazen insensitive spirit of the boys he envied but could not imitate: they would howl loudly under punishment, in order to mitigate it, and they were vaingloriously unconcerned ten minutes later. He did not think he could endure being whipped by the fat young man with the flower: at three o'clock, white-faced, he went to the man's office.",1
334,"Armstrong, slit-eyed and thin lipped, began to swish the cane he held in his hand through the air as Eugene entered. Behind him, smoothed and flatted on his desk, was stacked the damning pile of rhymed insult. Did you write these?"" he demanded, narrowing his eyes to little points in order to frighten his victim.",1
335,"Yes,"" said Eugene. The principal cut the air again with his cane. He had visited Daisy several times, had eaten at Gant's plenteous board. He remembered very well.",1
336,"What have I ever done to you, son, that you should feel this way? he said, with a sudden change of whining magnanimity. N-n-nothing,"" said Eugene.",1
337,"Do you think you'll ever do it again?"" said he, becoming ominous again. N-no, sir,"" Eugene answered, in the ghost of a voice. All right,"" said God, grandly, throwing away his cane. You can go. His legs found themselves only when he had reached the playground.",1
338,"But oh, the brave autumn and the songs they sang; harvest, and the painting of a leaf; and ""half-holiday to-day""; and ""up in the air so high""; and the other one about the train--""the stations go whistling past""; the mellow days, the opening gates of desire, the smoky sun, the dropping patter of dead leaves. Every little snowflake is different in shape from every other. Good grashus!",1
339,"ALL of them, Miss Pratt?""  ""All of the little snowflakes that ever were. Nature never repeats herself. Aw!""    Ben's beard was growing: he had shaved.",1
340,"He tumbled Eugene on the leather sofa, played with him for hours, scraped his stubble chin against the soft face of his brother. Eugene shrieked. When you can do that you'll be a man,"" said Ben.",1
341,"And he sang softly, in his thin humming ghost's voice:        ""The woodpecker pecked at the schoolhouse door,       He pecked and he pecked till his pecker got sore. The woodpecker pecked at the schoolhouse bell,       He pecked and he pecked till his pecker got well. They laughed--Eugene with rocking throatiness, Ben with a quiet snicker.",1
342,"He had aqueous gray eyes, and a sallow bumpy skin. His head was shapely, the forehead high and bony. His hair was crisp, maple-brown. Below his perpetual scowl, his face was small, converging to a point: his extraordinarily sensitive mouth smiled briefly, flickeringly, inwardly--like a flash of light along a blade. And he always gave a cuff instead of a caress: he was full of pride and tenderness.",1
343,"9   Yes, and in that month when Prosperpine comes back, and Ceres' dead heart rekindles, when all the woods are a tender smoky blur, and birds no bigger than a budding leaf dart through the singing trees, and when odorous tar comes spongy in the streets, and boys roll balls of it upon their tongues, and they are lumpy with tops and agated marbles; and there is blasting thunder in the night, and the soaking millionfooted rain, and one looks out at morning on a stormy sky, a broken wrack of cloud; and when the mountain boy brings water to his kinsmen laying fence, and as the wind snakes through the grasses hears far in the valley below the long wail of the whistle, and the faint clangor of a bell; and the blue great cup of the hills seems closer, nearer, for he had heard an inarticulate promise: he has been pierced by Spring, that sharp knife. And life unscales its rusty weathered pelt, and earth wells out in tender exhaustless strength, and the cup of a man's heart runs over with dateless expectancy, tongueless promise, indefinable desire. Something gathers in the throat, something blinds him in the eyes, and faint and valorous horns sound through the earth.",1
344,"The little girls trot pigtailed primly on their dutiful way to school; but the young gods loiter: they hear the reed, the oatenstop, the running goathoofs in the spongy wood, here, there, everywhere: they dawdle, listen, fleetest when they wait, go vaguely on to their one fixed home, because the earth is full of ancient rumor and they cannot find the way. All of the gods have lost the way. But they guarded what they had against the barbarians. Eugene, Max, and Harry ruled their little neighborhood: they made war upon the negroes and the Jews, who amused them, and upon the Pigtail Alley people, whom they hated and despised. Catlike they prowled about in the dark promise of night, sitting at times upon a wall in the exciting glare of the corner lamp, which flared gaseously, winking noisily from time to time.",1
345,"Or, crouched in the concealing shrubbery of Gant's yard, they waited for romantic negro couples climbing homewards, jerking by a cord, as their victims came upon the spot, a stuffed black snake- appearing stocking. And the dark was shrill with laughter as the loud rich comic voices stammered, stopped, and screamed. Or they stoned the cycling black boy of the markets, as he swerved down gracefully into an alley. Nor did they hate them: clowns are black. They had learned, as well, that it was proper to cuff these people kindly, curse them cheerfully, feed them magnanimously. Men are kind to a faithful wagging dog, but he must not walk habitually upon two legs. They knew that they must ""take nothin' off a nigger,"" and that the beginnings of argument could best be scotched with a club and a broken head. Only, you couldn't break a nigger's head.",1
346,"They spat joyously upon the Jews. Drown a Jew and hit a nigger. The boys would wait on the Jews, follow them home shouting ""Goose Grease! Goose Grease!"" which, they were convinced, was the chief staple of Semitic diet; or with the blind acceptance of little boys of some traditional, or mangled, or imaginary catchword of abuse, they would yell after their muttering and tormented victim: ""Veeshamadye Veeshamadye!"" confident that they had pronounced the most unspeakable, to Jewish ears, of affronts.",1
347,"Eugene had no interest in pogroms, but it was a fetich with Max. The chief object of their torture was a little furtive-faced boy, whose name was Isaac Lipinski. They pounced cattishly at him when he appeared, harried him down alleys, over fences, across yards, into barns, stables, and his own house; he moved with amazing speed and stealth, escaping fantastically, teasing them to the pursuit, thumbing his fingers at them, and grinning with wide Kike constant derision.",1
348,"Or, steeped catlike in the wickedness of darkness, adrift in the brooding promise of the neighborhood, they would cluster silently under a Jew's home, grouped in a sniggering huddle as they listened to the rich excited voices, the throaty accentuation of the women; or convulsed at the hysterical quarrels which shook the Jew-walls almost nightly. Once, shrieking with laughter, they followed a running fight through the streets between a young Jew and his father-in-law, in which each was pursued and pummelled, or pursuing and pummelling; and on the day when Louis Greenberg, a pale Jew returned from college, had killed himself by drinking carbolic acid, they stood curiously outside the dingy wailing house, shaken by sudden glee as they saw his father, a bearded orthodox old Jew, clothed in rusty, greasy black, and wearing a scarred derby, approach running up the hill to his home, shaking his hands in the air, and wailing rhythmically:        ""Oi, yoi yoi yoi yoi,       Oi yoi yoi yoi yoi, Oi yoi yoi yoi yoi.",1
349,"But the whiteheaded children of Pigtail Alley they hated without humor, without any mitigation of a most bitter and alienate hate. Pigtail Alley was a muddy rut which sprawled down hill off the lower end of Woodson Street, ending vaguely in the rank stench of a green-scummed marsh bottom. On one side of this vile road there was a ragged line of whitewashed shacks, inhabited by poor whites, whose children were almost always whitehaired, and who, snuff- mouthed bony women, and tobacco-jawed men, sprawled stupidly in the sun-stench of their rude wide-boarded porches. At night a smoky lamp burned dismally in the dark interiors, there was a smell of frying cookery and of unclean flesh, strident rasping shrews' cries, the drunken maniacal mountain drawl of men: a scream and a curse.",1
350,"Once, in the cherry time, when Gant's great White Wax was loaded with its clusters, and the pliant and enduring boughs were dotted thickly by the neighbor children, Jews and Gentiles alike, who had been herded under the captaincy of Luke, and picked one quart of every four for their own, one of these whitehaired children had come doubtfully, mournfully, up the yard. All right, son,"" Luke, who was fifteen, called out in his hearty voice. Get a basket and come on up. The child came up the gummed trunk like a cat: Eugene rocked from the slender spiral topmost bough, exulting in his lightness, the tree's resilient strength, and the great morning-clarion fragrant backyard world.",1
351,"The Alley picked his bucket with miraculous speed, skinned spryly to the ground and emptied it into the heaping pan, and was halfway up the trunk again when his gaunt mother streaked up the yard toward him. You, Reese,"" she shrilled, ""what're you doin' hyar? She jerked him roughly to the ground and cut across his brown legs with a switch. He howled.",1
352,"You git along home,"" she ordered, giving him another cut. She drove him along, upbraiding him in her harsh voice, cutting him sharply with the switch from moment to moment when, desperate with pride and humiliation, he slackened his retreat to a slow walk, or balked mulishly, howling again, and speeding a few paces on his short legs, when cut by the switch. The treed boys sniggered, but Eugene, who had seen the pain upon the gaunt hard face of the woman, the furious pity of her blazing eyes, felt something open and burst stabbingly in him like an abscess.",1
353,"He left his cherries,"" he said to his brother. Or, they jeered Loney Shytle, who left a stale sharp odor as she passed, her dirty dun hair covered in a wide plumed hat, her heels out of her dirty white stockings. She had caused incestuous rivalry between her father and her brother, she bore the scar of her mother's razor in her neck, and she walked, in her rundown shoes, with the wide stiff-legged hobble of disease.",1
354,"One day as they pressed round a trapped alley boy, who backed slowly, fearfully, resentfully into a reeking wall, Willie Isaacs, the younger brother of Max, pointing with sniggering laughter, said:  ""His mother takes in washin'.  And then, almost bent double by a soaring touch of humor, he added:  ""His mother takes in washin' from an ole nigger.",1
355,"Harry Tarkinton laughed hoarsely. Eugene turned away indefinitely, craned his neck convulsively, lifted one foot sharply from the ground. She don't! he screamed suddenly into their astounded faces. She don't!""    Harry Tarkinton's parents were English.",1
356,"He was three or four years older than Eugene, an awkward, heavy, muscular boy, smelling always of his father's paints and oils, coarse-featured, meaty sloping jaw and a thick catarrhal look about his nose and mouth. He was the breaker of visions; the proposer of iniquities. In the cool thick evening grass of Gant's yard one sunset, he smashed forever, as they lay there talking, the enchantment of Christmas; but he brought in its stead the smell of paint, the gaseous ripstink, the unadorned, sweating, and imageless passion of the vulgar. But Eugene couldn't follow his barn-yard passion: the strong hen- stench, the Tarkintonian paint-smell, and the rank-mired branch- smell which mined under the filthy shambles of the backyard, stopped him.",1
357,"Once, in the deserted afternoon, as he and Harry plundered through the vacant upper floor of Gant's house, they found a half-filled bottle of hair-restorer. Have you any hairs on your belly?"" said Harry.  Eugene hemmed; hinted timidly at shagginess; confessed. They undid their buttons, smeared oily hands upon their bellies, and waited through rapturous days for the golden fleece.",1
358,"Hair makes a man of you,"" said Harry.  More often, as Spring deepened, he went now to Gant's shop on the Square. He loved the scene: the bright hill-cooled sun, the blown sheets of spray from the fountain, the garrulous firemen emerging from the winter, the lazy sprawling draymen on his father's wooden steps, snaking their whips deftly across the pavement, wrestling in heavy horseplay, Jannadeau in his dirty fly-specked window prying with delicate monocled intentness into the entrails of a watch, the reeking mossiness of Gant's fantastical brick shack, the great interior dustiness of the main room in front, sagging with gravestones--small polished slabs from Georgia, blunt ugly masses of Vermont granite, modest monuments with an urn, a cherub figure, or a couchant lamb, ponderous fly-specked angels from Carrara in Italy which he bought at great cost, and never sold--they were the joy of his heart. Behind a wooden partition was his ware-room, layered with stonedust--coarse wooden trestles on which he carved inscriptions, stacked tool-shelves filled with chisels, drills, mallets, a pedalled emery wheel which Eugene worked furiously for hours, exulting in its mounting roar, piled sandstone bases, a small heat- blasted cast-iron stove, loose piled coal and wood.",1
359,"Between the workroom and the ware-room, on the left as one entered, was Gant's office, a small room, deep in the dust of twenty years, with an old-fashioned desk, sheaves of banded dirty papers, a leather sofa, a smaller desk layered with round and square samples of marble and granite. The sloping market Square, pocketed obliquely off the public Square, and filled with the wagons of draymen and county peddlers, and on the lower side on a few Poor White houses and on the warehouse and office of Will Pentland. Eugene would find his father, leaning perilously on Jannadeau's dirty glass showcase, or on the creaking little fence that marked him off, talking politics, war, death, and famine, denouncing the Democrats, with references to the bad weather, taxation, and soup- kitchens that attended their administration, and eulogizing all the acts, utterances, and policies of Theodore Roosevelt. Jannadeau, guttural, judiciously reasonable, statistically argumentative, would consult, in all disputed areas, his library--a greasy edition of the World Almanac, three years old, saying, triumphantly, after a moment of dirty thumbing:  ""Ah--just as I thought: the muni-CIP-al taxation of Milwaukee under De-MO-cratic administration in 1905 was $2.25 the hundred, the lowest it had been in years. I cannot ima-GINE why the total revenue is not given. And he would argue with animation, picking his nose with his blunt black fingers, his broad yellow face breaking into flaccid creases, as he laughed gutturally at Gant's unreason.",1
360,"And you may mark my words,"" proceeded Gant, as if he had never been interrupted, and had heard no dissenting judgment, ""if they get in again we'll have soup-kitchens, the banks will go to the wall, and your guts will grease your backbone before another winter's over.  Or, he would find his father in the workroom, bending over a trestle, using the heavy wooden mallet with delicate care, as he guided the chisel through the mazes of an inscription. He never wore work-clothes; he worked dressed in well brushed garments of heavy black, his coat removed, and a long striped apron covering all his front. As Eugene saw him, he felt that this was no common craftsman, but a master, picking up his tools briefly for a chef- d'oeuvre.",1
361,"He is better at this than any one in all the world,"" Eugene thought, and his dark vision burned in him for a moment, as he thought that his father's work would never, as men reckon years, be extinguished, but that when that great skeleton lay powdered in earth, in many a tangled undergrowth, in the rank wilderness of forgotten churchyards, these letters would endure. And he thought with pity of all the grocers and brewers and clothiers who had come and gone, with their perishable work a forgotten excrement, or a rotted fabric; or of plumbers, like Max's father, whose work rusted under ground, or of painters, like Harry's, whose work scaled with the seasons, or was obliterated with newer brighter paint; and the high horror of death and oblivion, the decomposition of life, memory, desire, in the huge burial-ground of the earth stormed through his heart. He mourned for all the men who had gone because they had not scored their name upon a rock, blasted their mark upon a cliff, sought out the most imperishable objects of the world and graven there some token, some emblem that utterly they might not be forgotten.",1
362,"Again, Eugene would find Gant moving with bent strides across the depth of the building, tearing madly along between the sentinel marbles that aisled the ware-room, muttering, with hands gripped behind him, with ominous ebb and flow. Eugene waited. Presently, when he had shuttled thus across his shop some eighty times, he would leap, with a furious howl, to his front door, storming out upon the porch, and delivering his Jeremiad to the offending draymen:  ""You are the lowest of the low, the vilest of the vile.",1
363,"You lousy good-for-nothing bums: you have brought me to the verge of starvation, you have frightened away the little business that might have put bread in my mouth, and kept the wolf from my door. By God, I hate you, for you stink a mile off. You low degenerates, you accursed reprobates; you would steal the pennies from a dead man's eyes, as you have from mine, fearful, awful, and bloodthirsty mountain grills that you are!",1
364,"He would tear back into the shop muttering, to return almost at once, with a strained pretense at calmness, which ended in a howl:  ""Now I want to tell you: I give you fair warning once and for all. If I find you on my steps again, I'll put you all in jail. They would disperse sheepishly to their wagons, flicking their whips aimlessly along the pavements.",1
365,"By God, somethin's sure upset the ole man. An hour later, like heavy buzzing flies, they would drift back settling from nowhere on the broad steps. As he emerged from the shop into the Square, they would greet him cheerfully, with a certain affection.",1
366,"'Day, Mr. Gant.""  ""Good day, boys,"" he would answer kindly, absently. And he would be away with his gaunt devouring strides. As Eugene entered, if Gant were busy on a stone, he would say gruffly, ""Hello, son,"" and continue with his work, until he had polished the surface of the marble with pumice and water. Then he would take off his apron, put on his coat, and say, to the dawdling, expectant boy:  ""Come on. I guess you're thirsty.",1
367,"And they would go across the Square to the cool depth of the drugstore, stand before the onyx splendor of the fountain, under the revolving wooden fans, and drink chill gaseous beverages, limeade so cold it made the head ache, or foaming ice-cream soda, which returned in sharp delicious belches down his tender nostrils. Eugene, richer by twenty-five cents, would leave Gant then, and spend the remainder of the day in the library on the Square. He read now rapidly and easily; he read romantic and adventurous novels, with a tearing hunger. At home he devoured Luke's piled shelves of five-cent novels: he was deep in the weekly adventures of Young Wild West, fantasied in bed at night of virtuous and heroic relations with the beautiful Arietta, followed Nick Carter, through all the mazes of metropolitan crime, Frank Merriwell's athletic triumphs, Fred Fearnot, and the interminable victories of The Liberty Boys of '76 over the hated Redcoats.",1
368,"He cared not so much for love at first as he did for material success: the straw figures of women in boys' books, something with hair, dancing eyes, and virtuous opinions, impeccably good and vacant, satisfied him completely: they were the guerdon of heroism, something to be freed from villainy on the nick by a blow or a shot, and to be enjoyed along with a fat income. At the library he ravaged the shelves of boys' books, going unweariedly through all the infinite monotony of the Algers--Pluck and Luck, Sink or Swim, Grit, Jack's Ward, Jed the Poor-house Boy-- and dozens more. He gloated over the fat money-getting of these books (a motif in boys' books that has never been sufficiently recognized); all of the devices of fortune, the loose rail, the signalled train, the rich reward for heroism; or the full wallet found and restored to its owner; or the value of the supposedly worthless bonds; or the discovery of a rich patron in the city, sunk so deeply into his desires that he was never after able to quench them.",1
369,"And all the details of money--the value of the estate usurped by the scoundrelly guardian and his caddish son, he feasted upon, reckoning up the amount of income, if it were not given, or if it were, dividing the annual sum into monthly and weekly portions, and dreaming on its purchasing power. His desires were not modest--no fortune under $250,000 satisfied him: the income of $100,000 at six per cent would pinch one, he felt, from lavishness; and if the reward of virtue was only twenty thousand dollars, he felt bitter chagrin, reckoning life insecure, and comfort a present warmth. He built up a constant exchange of books among his companions, borrowing and lending in an intricate web, from Max Isaacs, from ""Nosey"" Schmidt, the butcher's son, who had all the rich adventures of the Rover Boys; he ransacked Gant's shelves at home, reading translations of the Iliad and the Odyssey at the same time as Diamond Dick, Buffalo Bill, and the Algers, and for the same reason; then, as the first years waned and the erotic gropings became more intelligible, he turned passionately to all romantic legendry, looking for women in whom blood ran hotly, whose breath was honey, and whose soft touch a spurting train of fire.",1
370,"And in this pillage of the loaded shelves, he found himself wedged firmly into the grotesque pattern of Protestant fiction which yields the rewards of Dionysus to the loyal disciples of John Calvin, panting and praying in a breath, guarding the plumtree with the altar fires, outdoing the pagan harlot with the sanctified hussy. Aye, thought he, he would have his cake and eat it too--but it would be a wedding-cake. He was devout in his desire to be a good man; he would bestow the accolade of his love upon nothing but a Virgin; he would marry himself to none but a Pure Woman. This, he saw from the books, would cause no renunciation of delight, for the good women were physically the most attractive.",1
371,"He had learned unknowingly what the exquisite voluptuary finds, after weary toil, much later--that no condition of life is so favorable to his enjoyment as that one which is rigidly conventionalized. He had all the passionate fidelity of a child to the laws of the community: all the filtered deposit of Sunday Morning Presbyterianism had its effect. He entombed himself in the flesh of a thousand fictional heroes, giving his favorites extension in life beyond their books, carrying their banners into the gray places of actuality, seeing himself now as the militant young clergyman, arrayed, in his war on slum conditions, against all the moneyed hostility of his fashionable church, aided in his hour of greatest travail by the lovely daughter of the millionaire tenement owner, and winning finally a victory for God, the poor, and himself.    . . .",1
372,"They stood silently a moment in the vast deserted nave of Saint Thomas'. Far in the depth of the vast church Old Michael's slender hands pressed softly on the organ-keys. The last rays of the setting sun poured in a golden shaft down through the western windows, falling for a moment, in a cloud of glory, as if in benediction, on Mainwaring's tired face.",1
373,"I am going,"" he said presently.  ""Going? she whispered. Where?""  The organ music deepened.",1
374,"Out there,"" he gestured briefly to the West. Out there--among His people. Going?",1
375,She could not conceal the tremor of her voice. Going? Alone? He smiled sadly.,1
376,"The sun had set. The gathering darkness hid the suspicious moisture in his gray eyes. Yes, alone,"" he said. Did not One greater than I go out alone some nineteen centuries ago? Alone?",1
377,"Alone? A sob rose in her throat and choked her. But before I go,"" he said, after a moment, in a voice which he strove in vain to render steady, ""I want to tell you-- He paused for a moment, struggling for mastery of his feelings.",1
378,"Yes?"" she whispered. --That I shall never forget you, little girl, as long as I live. Never. He turned abruptly to depart.",1
379,"No, not alone! You shall not go alone! she stopped him with a sudden cry.",1
380,"He whirled as if he had been shot. What do you mean? What do you mean?"" he cried hoarsely.",1
381,"Oh, can't you see! Can't you see! She threw out her little hands imploringly, and her voice broke.",1
382,"Grace!  Grace! Dear heaven, do you mean it!""  ""You silly man! Oh, you dear blind foolish boy! Haven't you known for ages--since the day I first heard you preach at the Murphy Street settlement?""  He crushed her to him in a fierce embrace; her slender body yielded to his touch as he bent over her; and her round arms stole softly across his broad shoulders, around his neck, drawing his dark head to her as he planted hungry kisses on her closed eyes, the column of her throat, the parted petal of her fresh young lips.",1
383,"Forever,"" he answered solemnly. So help me God. The organ music swelled now into a triumphant pæan, filling with its exultant melody that vast darkness of the church.",1
384,"And as Old Michael cast his heart into the music, the tears flowed unrestrained across his withered cheeks, but smilingly happily through his tears, as dimly through his old eyes he saw the two young figures enacting again the age-old tale of youth and love, he murmured,  ""I am the resurrection and the life, Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end"" . . . Eugene turned his wet eyes to the light that streamed through the library windows, winked rapidly, gulped, and blew his nose heavily. Ah, yes! Ah, yes!    . . .",1
385,"The band of natives, seeing now that they had no more to fear, and wild with rage at the losses they had suffered, began to advance slowly toward the foot of the cliff, led by Taomi, who, dancing with fury, and hideous with warpaint, urged them on, exhorting them in a shrill voice. Glendenning cursed softly under his breath as he looked once more at the empty cartridge belts, then grimly, as he gazed at the yelling horde below, slipped his two remaining cartridges into his Colt. For us?"" she said, quietly. He nodded.",1
386,"It is the end? she whispered, but without a trace of fear. Again he nodded, and turned his head away for a moment. Presently he lifted his gray face to her.",1
387,"It is death, Veronica,"" he said, ""and now I may speak. Yes, Bruce,"" she answered softly. It was the first time he had ever heard her use his name, and his heart thrilled to it.",1
388,"I love you, Veronica,"" he said. I have loved you ever since I found your almost lifeless body on the beach, during all the nights I lay outside your tent, listening to your quiet breathing within, love you most of all now in this hour of death when the obligation to keep silence no longer rests upon me. Dearest, dearest,"" she whispered, and he saw her face was wet with tears.",1
389,"Why didn't you speak? I have loved you from the first. She leaned toward him, her lips half-parted and tremulous, her breathing short and uncertain, and as his bare arms circled her fiercely their lips met in one long moment of rapture, one final moment of life and ecstasy, in which all the pent longing of their lives found release and consummation now at this triumphant moment of their death.",1
390,"A distant reverberation shook the air. Glendenning looked up quickly, and rubbed his eyes with astonishment. There, in the island's little harbor were turning slowly the lean sides of a destroyer, and even as he looked, there was another burst of flame and smoke, and a whistling five-inch shell burst forty yards from where the natives had stopped. With a yell of mingled fear and baffled rage, they turned and fled off toward their canoes. Already, a boat, manned by the lusty arms of a blue-jacketed crew, had put off from the destroyer's side, and was coming in toward shore.",1
391,"Saved! We are saved! cried Glendenning, and leaping to his feet he signalled the approaching boat. Suddenly he paused.",1
392,"Damn! he muttered bitterly. Oh, damn!""  ""What is it, Bruce?",1
393,"she asked. He answered her in a cold harsh voice. A destroyer has just entered the harbor. We are saved, Miss Mullins. Saved! And he laughed bitterly.",1
394,"Bruce!  Dearest! What is it? Aren't you glad? Why do you act so strangely? We shall have all our life together. Together?"" he said, with a harsh laugh.",1
395,"Oh no, Miss Mullins. I know my place. Do you think old J. T. Mullins would let his daughter marry Bruce Glendenning, international vagabond, jack of all trades, and good at none of them? Oh no. That's over now, and it's good-by. I suppose,"" he said, with a wry smile, ""I'll hear of your marriage to some Duke or Lord, or some of those foreigners some day. Well, good-by, Miss Mullins. Good luck. We'll both have to go our own way, I suppose. He turned away.",1
396,"You foolish boy! You dear bad silly boy! She threw her arms around his neck, clasped him to her tightly, and scolded him tenderly. Do you think I'll ever let you leave me now?""  ""Veronica,"" he gasped.",1
397,"Do you MEAN it? She tried to meet his adoring eyes, but couldn't: a rich wave of rosy red mantled her cheek, he drew her rapturously to him and, for the second time, but this time with the prophecy of eternal and abundant life before them, their lips met in sweet oblivion. . . . Ah, me! Ah, me! Eugene's heart was filled with joy and sadness-- with sorrow because the book was done. He pulled his clotted handkerchief from his pocket and blew the contents of his loaded heart into it in one mighty, triumphant and ecstatic blast of glory and sentiment. Ah, me! Good old Bruce-Eugene.",1
398,"Lifted, by his fantasy, into a high interior world, he scored off briefly and entirely all the grimy smudges of life: he existed nobly in a heroic world with lovely and virtuous creatures. He saw himself in exalted circumstances with Bessie Barnes, her pure eyes dim with tears, her sweet lips tremulous with desire: he felt the strong handgrip of Honest Jack, her brother, his truehearted fidelity, the deep eternal locking of their brave souls, as they looked dumbly at each other with misty eyes, and thought of the pact of danger, the shoulder-to-shoulder drive through death and terror which had soldered them silently but implacably. Eugene wanted the two things all men want: he wanted to be loved, and he wanted to be famous. His fame was chameleon, but its fruit and triumph lay at home, among the people of Altamont. The mountain town had for him enormous authority: with a child's egotism it was for him the centre of the earth, the small but dynamic core of all life. He saw himself winning Napoleonic triumphs in battle, falling, with his fierce picked men, like a thunderbolt upon an enemy's flank, trapping, hemming, and annihilating. He saw himself as the young captain of industry, dominant, victorious, rich; as the great criminal-lawyer bending to his eloquence a charmed court--but always he saw his return from the voyage wearing the great coronal of the world upon his modest brows.",1
399,"The world was a phantasmal land of faery beyond the misted hem of the hills, a land of great reverberations, of genii-guarded orchards, wine-dark seas, chasmed and fantastical cities from which he would return into this substantial heart of life, his native town, with golden loot. He quivered deliciously to temptation--he kept his titillated honor secure after subjecting it to the most trying inducements: the groomed beauty of the rich man's wife, publicly humiliated by her brutal husband, defended by Bruce-Eugene, and melting toward him with all the pure ardor of her lonely and womanly heart, pouring the sad measure of her life into his sympathetic ears over the wineglasses of her candled, rich, but intimate table. And as, in the shaded light, she moved yearningly toward him, sheathed plastically in her gown of rich velvet, he would detach gently the round arms that clung about his neck, the firm curved body that stuck gluily to his. Or the blonde princess in the fabulous Balkans, the empress of gabled Toyland, and the Doll Hussars--he would renounce, in a great scene upon the frontiers, her proffered renunciation, drinking eternal farewell on her red mouth, but wedding her to himself and to the citizenship of freedom when revolution had levelled her fortune to his own.",1
400,"But, steeping himself in ancient myths, where the will and the deed were not thought darkly on, he spent himself, quilted in golden meadows, or in the green light of woods, in pagan love. Oh to be king, and see a fruity wide-hipped Jewess bathing on her roof, and to possess her; or a cragged and castled baron, to execute le droit de seigneur upon the choicest of the enfeoffed wives and wenches, in a vast chamber loud with the howling winds and lighted by the mad dancing flames of great logs! But even more often, the shell of his morality broken to fragments by his desire, he would enact the bawdy fable of school-boys, and picture himself in hot romance with a handsome teacher. In the fourth grade his teacher was a young, inexperienced, but well-built woman, with carrot-colored hair, and full of reckless laughter.",1
401,"He saw himself, grown to the age of potency, a strong, heroic, brilliant boy, the one spot of incandescence in a backwoods school attended by snag-toothed children and hair-faced louts. And, as the mellow autumn ripened, her interest in him would intensify, she would ""keep him in"" for imaginary offenses, setting him, in a somewhat confused way, to do some task, and gazing at him with steady yearning eyes when she thought he was not looking. He would pretend to be stumped by the exercise: she would come eagerly and sit beside him, leaning over so that a few fine strands of carrot-colored hair brushed his nostrils, and so that he might feel the firm warmth of her white-waisted arms, and the swell of her tight-skirted thighs. She would explain things to him at great length, guiding his fingers with her own warm, slightly moist hand, when he pretended not to find the place; then she would chide him gently, saying tenderly:  ""Why are you such a bad boy?"" or softly:  ""Do you think you're going to be better after this?",1
402,"And he, simulating boyish, inarticulate coyness, would say:  ""Gosh, Miss Edith, I didn't mean to do nothin'. Later, as the golden sun was waning redly, and there was nothing in the room but the smell of chalk and the heavy buzz of the old October flies, they would prepare to depart. As he twisted carelessly into his overcoat, she would chide him, call him to her, arrange the lapels and his necktie, and smooth out his tousled hair, saying:  ""You're a good-looking boy.",1
403,"I bet all the girls are wild about you. He would blush in a maidenly way and she, bitten with curiosity, would press him:  ""Come on, now. Who's your girl?""  ""I haven't got one, honest, Miss Edith.",1
404,"You don't want one of these silly little girls, Eugene,"" she would say, coaxingly. You're too good for them--you're a great deal older than your years. You need the understanding a mature woman can give you.",1
405,"And they would walk away in the setting sun, skirting the pine- fresh woods, passing along the path red with maple leaves, past great ripening pumpkins in the fields, and under the golden autumnal odor of persimmons. She would live alone with her mother, an old deaf woman, in a little cottage set back from the road against a shelter of lonely singing pines, with a few grand oaks and maples in the leaf-bedded yard. Before they came to the house, crossing a field, it would be necessary to go over a stile; he would go over first, helping her down, looking ardently at the graceful curve of her long, deliberately exposed, silk-clad leg.",1
406,"As the days shortened, they would come by dark, or under the heavy low-hanging autumnal moon. She would pretend to be frightened as they passed the woods, press in to him and take his arm at imaginary sounds, until one night, crossing the stile, boldly resolved upon an issue, she would pretend difficulty in descending, and he would lift her down in his arms. She would whisper:  ""How strong you are, Eugene.",1
407,"Still holding her, his hand would shift under her knees. And as he lowered her upon the frozen clotted earth, she would kiss him passionately, again and again, pressing him to her, caressing him, and under the frosted persimmon tree fulfilling and yielding herself up to his maiden and unfledged desire. That boy's read books by the hundreds,"" Gant boasted about the town. He's read everything in the library by now. By God, W. O., you'll have to make a lawyer out of him.",1
408,"That's what he's cut out for. Major Liddell spat accurately, out of his high cracked voice, across the pavement, and settled back in his chair below the library windows, smoothing his stained white pointed beard with a palsied hand. He was a veteran.",1
409,"10 But this freedom, this isolation in print, this dreaming and unlimited time of fantasy, was not to last unbroken. Both Gant and Eliza were fluent apologists for economic independence: all the boys had been sent out to earn money at a very early age.",1
410,"It teaches a boy to be independent and self-reliant,"" said Gant, feeling he had heard this somewhere before. Pshaw!"" said Eliza. It won't do them a bit of harm. If they don't learn now, they won't do a stroke of work later on. Besides, they can earn their own pocket money. This, undoubtedly, was a consideration of the greatest importance.",1
411,"Thus, the boys had gone out to work, after school hours, and in the vacations, since they were very young. Unhappily, neither Eliza nor Gant were at any pains to examine the kind of work their children did, contenting themselves vaguely with the comfortable assurance that all work which earned money was honest, commendable, and formative of character. By this time Ben, sullen, silent, alone, had withdrawn more closely than ever into his heart: in the brawling house he came and went, and was remembered, like a phantom. Each morning at three o'clock, when his fragile unfurnished body should have been soaked in sleep, he got up under the morning stars, departed silently from the sleeping house, and went down to the roaring morning presses and the inksmell that he loved, to begin the delivery of his route. Almost without consideration by Gant and Eliza he slipped quietly away from school after the eighth grade, took on extra duties at the paper's office and lived, in sufficient bitter pride, upon his earnings. He slept at home, ate perhaps one meal a day there, loping home gauntly at night, with his father's stride, thin long shoulders, bent prematurely by the weight of the heavy paper bag, pathetically, hungrily Gantian.",1
412,"He bore encysted in him the evidence of their tragic fault: he walked alone in the darkness, death and the dark angels hovered, and no one saw him. At three-thirty in the morning, with his loaded bag beside him, he sat with other route boys in a lunch room, with a cup of coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the other, laughing softly, almost noiselessly, with his flickering exquisitely sensitive mouth, his scowling gray eyes. At home he spent hours quietly absorbed in his life with Eugene, playing with him, cuffing him with his white hard hands from time to time, establishing with him a secret communication to which the life of the family had neither access nor understanding. From his small wages he gave the boy sums of spending-money, bought him expensive presents on his birthdays, at Christmas, or some special occasion, inwardly moved and pleased when he saw how like Mæcenas he seemed to Eugene, how deep and inexhaustible to the younger boy were his meagre resources. What he earned, all the history of his life away from home, he kept in jealous secrecy.",1
413,"It's nobody's business but my own. By God, I'm not asking any of you for anything,"" he said, sullenly and irritably, when Eliza pressed him curiously. He had a deep scowling affection for them all: he never forgot their birthdays, he always placed where they might find it, some gift, small, inexpensive, selected with the most discriminating taste. When, with their fervent over-emphasis, they went through long ecstasies of admiration, embroidering their thanks with florid decorations, he would jerk his head sideways to some imaginary listener, laughing softly and irritably, as he said:",1
414,"Oh for God's sake!  Listen to this, won't you! Perhaps, as pigeon-toed, well creased, brushed, white-collared, Ben loped through the streets, or prowled softly and restlessly about the house, his dark angel wept, but no one else saw, and no one knew. He was a stranger, and as he sought through the house, he was always aprowl to find some entrance into life, some secret undiscovered door--a stone, a leaf,--that might admit him into light and fellowship. His passion for home was fundamental, in that jangled and clamorous household his sullen and contained quiet was like some soothing opiate on their nerves: with quiet authority, white-handed skill, he sought about repairing old scars, joining with delicate carpentry old broken things, prying quietly about a short-circuited wire, a defective socket.",1
415,"That boy's a born electrical engineer,"" said Gant. I've a good notion to send him off to school. And he would paint a romantic picture of the prosperity of Mr. Charles Liddell, the Major's worthy son, who earned thousands by his electrical wizardry, and supported his father. And he would reproach them bitterly, as he dwelt on his own merit and the worthlessness of his sons:  ""Other men's sons support their fathers in their old age--not mine! Not mine!",1
416,"Ah Lord--it will be a bitter day for me when I have to depend on one of mine. Tarkinton told me the other day that Rafe has given him five dollars a week for his food ever since he was sixteen. Do you think I could look for such treatment from one of mine? Do you? Not until Hell freezes over--and not then! And he would refer to the hardships of his own youth, cast out, so he said, to earn his living, at an age which varied, according to his temper, at from six to eleven years, contrasting his poverty to the luxury in which his own children wallowed.",1
417,"No one ever did anything for me,"" he howled. But everything's been done for you. And what gratitude do I get from you? Do you ever think of the old man who slaves up there in his cold shop in order to give you food and shelter? Do you? Ingratitude, more fierce than brutish beasts! Remorseful food stuck vengefully in Eugene's throat.",1
418,"Eugene was initiated to the ethics of success. It was not enough that a man work, though work was fundamental; it was even more important that he make money--a great deal if he was to be a great success--but at least enough to ""support himself. This was for both Gant and Eliza the base of worth. Of so and so, they might say:  ""He's not worth powder enough to kill him.",1
419,"He's never been able to support himself,"" to which Eliza, but not Gant, might add:  ""He hasn't a stick of property to his name. This crowned him with infamy. In the fresh sweet mornings of Spring now, Eugene was howled out of bed at six-thirty by his father, descended to the cool garden, and there, assisted by Gant, filled small strawberry baskets with great crinkled lettuces, radishes, plums, and green apples--somewhat later, with cherries. With these packed in a great hamper, he would peddle his wares through the neighborhood, selling them easily and delightfully, in a world of fragrant morning cookery, at five or ten cents a basket. He would return home gleefully with empty hamper in time for breakfast: he liked the work, the smell of gardens, of fresh wet vegetables; he loved the romantic structure of the earth which filled his pocket with chinking coins.",1
420,"He was permitted to keep the money of his sales, although Eliza was annoyingly insistent that he should not squander it, but open a bank account with it with which, one day, he might establish himself in business, or buy a good piece of property. And she bought him a little bank, into which his reluctant fingers dropped a portion of his earnings, and from which he got a certain dreary satisfaction from time to time by shaking it close to his ear and dwelling hungrily on all the purchasable delight that was locked away from him in the small heavy bullion-clinking vault. There was a key, but Eliza kept it.",1
421,"But, as the months passed, and the sturdy child's body of his infancy lengthened rapidly to some interior chemical expansion, and he became fragile, thin, pallid, but remarkably tall for his age, Eliza began to say:  ""That boy's big enough to do a little work. Every Thursday afternoon now during the school months, and thence until Saturday, he was sent out upon the streets to sell The Saturday Evening Post, of which Luke held the local agency. Eugene hated the work with a deadly sweltering hatred; he watched the approach of Thursday with sick horror.",1
422,"Luke had been the agent since his twelfth year: his reputation for salesmanship was sown through the town; he came with wide grin, exuberant vitality, wagging and witty tongue, hurling all his bursting energy into an insane extraversion. He lived absolutely in event: there was in him no secret place, nothing withheld and guarded--he had an instinctive horror of all loneliness. He wanted above all else to be esteemed and liked by the world, and the need for the affection and esteem of his family was desperately essential. The fulsome praise, the heartiness of hand and tongue, the liberal display of sentiment were as the breath of life to him: he was overwhelmingly insistent in the payment of drinks at the fountain, the bringer-home of packed ice-cream for Eliza, and of cigars to Gant and, as Gant gave publication to his generosity, the boy's need for it increased--he built up an image of himself as the Good Fellow, witty, unselfish, laughed at but liked by all--as Big- Hearted Unselfish Luke. And this was the opinion people had of him.",1
423,"Many times in the years that followed, when Eugene's pockets were empty, Luke thrust a coin roughly and impatiently in them, but, hard as the younger boy's need might be, there was always an awkward scene--painful, embarrassed protestations, a distressful confusion because Eugene, having accurately and intuitively gauged his brother's hunger for gratitude and esteem, felt sharply that he was yielding up his independence to a bludgeoning desire. He had never felt the slightest shame at Ben's bounty: his enormously sensitized perception had told him long since that he might get the curse of annoyance, the cuff of anger, from his brother, but that past indulgences would not be brandished over him, and that even the thought of having bestowed gifts would give Ben inward shame. In this, he was like Ben: the thought of a gift he made, with its self-congratulatory implications, made him writhe.",1
424,"Thus, before he was ten, Eugene's brooding spirit was nettled in the complexity of truth and seeming. He could find no words, no answers to the puzzles that baffled and maddened him: he found himself loathing that which bore the stamp of virtue, sick with weariness and horror at what was considered noble. He was hurled, at eight years, against the torturing paradox of the ungenerous- generous, the selfish-unselfish, the noble-base, and unable to fathom or define those deep springs of desire in the human spirit that seek public gratification by virtuous pretension, he was made wretched by the conviction of his own sinfulness.",1
425,"There was in him a savage honesty, which exercised an uncontrollable domination over him when his heart or head were deeply involved. Thus, at the funeral of some remote kinsman, or of some acquaintance of the family, for whom he had never acquired any considerable affection, he would grow bitterly shamefast if, while listening to the solemn drone of the minister, or the sorrowful chanting of the singers, he felt his face had assumed an expression of unfelt and counterfeited grief: as a consequence he would shift about matter- of-factly, cross his legs, gaze indifferently at the ceiling, or look out of the window with a smile, until he was conscious his conduct had attracted the attention of people, and that they were looking on him with disfavor. Then, he felt a certain grim satisfaction as if, although having lost esteem, he had recorded his life.",1
426,"But Luke flourished hardily in all the absurd mummery of the village: he gave heaping weight to every simulation of affection, grief, pity, good-will, and modesty--there was no excess that he did not underscore heavily, and the world's dull eye read him kindly. He spun himself outward with ceaseless exuberance: he was genuinely and whole-heartedly involved. There was in him no toilsome web that might have checked him, no balancing or restraining weight--he had enormous energy, hungry gregariousness, the passion to pool his life.",1
427,"In the family, where a simple brutal tag was enough for the appraisal of all fine consciences, Ben went simply as ""the quiet one,"" Luke as the generous and unselfish one, Eugene as the ""scholar. It served. The generous one, who had never in all his life had the power to fasten his mind upon the pages of a book, or the logic of number, for an hour together, resented, as he see- sawed comically from one leg to another, stammering quaintly, whistling for the word that stuck in his throat, the brooding abstraction of the youngest.",1
428,"Come on, this is no time for day-dreaming,"" he would stammer ironically. The early bird catches the worm--it's time we went out on the street.",1
429,"And although his reference to day-dreams was only part of the axiomatic mosaic of his speech, Eugene was startled and confused, feeling that his secret world, so fearfully guarded, had been revealed to ridicule. And the older boy, too, smarting from his own dismal performances at school, convinced himself that the deep inward turning of the spirit, the brooding retreat into the secret place, which he recognized in the mysterious hypnotic power of language over Eugene, was not only a species of indolence, for the only work he recognized was that which strained at weight or sweated in the facile waggery of the tongue, but that it was moreover the indulgence of a ""selfish"" family-forgetting spirit. He was determined to occupy alone the throne of goodness.",1
430,"Thus, Eugene gathered vaguely but poignantly, that other boys of his age were not only self-supporting, but had for years kept their decrepit parents in luxury by their earnings as electrical engineers, presidents of banks, or members of Congress. There was, in fact, no excess of suggestion that Gant did not use upon his youngest son--he had felt, long since, the vibration to every tremor of feeling of the million-noted little instrument, and it pleased him to see the child wince, gulp, tortured with remorse. Thus, while he piled high with succulent meat the boy's platter, he would say sentimentally:  ""I tell you what: there are not many boys who have what you have.",1
431,"What's going to become of you when your old father's dead and gone? And he would paint a ghastly picture of himself lying cold in death, lowered forever into the damp rot of the earth, buried, forgotten--an event which, he hinted sorrowfully, was not remote. You'll remember the old man, then,"" he would say. Ah, Lord! You never miss the water till the well goes dry,"" noting with keen pleasure the inward convulsion of the childish throat, the winking eyes, the tense constricted face.",1
432,"I'll vow, Mr. Gant,"" Eliza bridled, also pleased, ""you oughtn't to do that to the child.  Or, he would speak sadly of ""Little Jimmy,"" a legless little boy whom he had often pointed out to Eugene, who lived across the river from Riverside, the amusement park, and around whom he had woven a pathetic fable of poverty and orphanage which was desperately real now to his son. When Eugene was six, Gant had promised him carelessly a pony for Christmas, without any intention of fulfilling his promise. As Christmas neared he had begun to speak touchingly of ""Little Jimmy,"" of the countless advantages of Eugene's lot and, after a mighty struggle, the boy had renounced the pony, in a scrawled message to Elfland, in favor of the cripple. Eugene never forgot: even when he had reached manhood the deception of ""Little Jimmy"" returned to him, without rancor, without ugliness, only with pain for all the blind waste, the stupid perjury, the thoughtless dishonor, the crippling dull deceit.",1
433,"Luke parroted all of his father's sermons, but earnestly and witlessly, without Gant's humor, without his chicanery, only with his sentimentality. He lived in a world of symbols, large, crude, and gaudily painted, labelled ""Father,"" ""Mother,"" ""Home,"" ""Family,"" ""Generosity,"" ""Honor,"" ""Unselfishness,"" made of sugar and molasses, and gummed glutinously with tear-shaped syrup. He's one good boy,"" the neighbors said.",1
434,"He's the cutest thing,"" said the ladies, who were charmed by his stutter, his wit, his good nature, his devout attendance on them. That boy's a hustler. He'll make his mark,"" said all the men in town.",1
435,"And it was as the smiling hustler that he wanted to be known. He read piously all the circulars the Curtis Publishing Company sent to its agents: he posed himself in the various descriptive attitudes that were supposed to promote business--the proper manner of ""approach,"" the most persuasive manner of drawing the journal from the bag, the animated description of its contents, in which he was supposed to be steeped as a result of his faithful reading-- ""the good salesman,"" the circulars said, ""should know in and out the article he is selling""--a knowledge that Luke avoided, but which he replaced with eloquent invention of his own. The literal digestion of these instructions resulted in one of the most fantastical exhibitions of print-vending ever seen: fortified by his own unlimited cheek, and by the pious axioms of the exhortations that ""the good salesman will never take no for his answer,"" that he should ""stick to his prospect"" even if rebuffed, that he should ""try to get the customer's psychology,"" the boy would fall into step with an unsuspecting pedestrian, open the broad sheets of The Post under the man's nose, and in a torrential harangue, sown thickly with stuttering speech, buffoonery, and ingratiation, delivered so rapidly that the man could neither accept nor reject the magazine, hound him before a grinning public down the length of a street, backing him defensively into a wall, and taking from the victim's eager fingers the five-cent coin that purchased his freedom.",1
436,"Yes, sir. Yes, sir,"" he would begin in a sonorous voice, dropping wide-leggedly into the ""prospect's"" stride. This week's edition of The Saturday Evening Post, five cents, only a nickel, p-p-p- purchased weekly by t-t-two million readers. In this week's issue you have eighty-six pages of f-f-fact and fiction, to say n-n- nothing of the advertisements. If you c-c-c-can't read you'll get m-m-more than your money's worth out of the p-p-pictures. On page 13 this week, we have a very fine article, by I-I-I-Isaac F. Marcosson, the f-f-f-famous traveller and writer on politics; on page 29, you have a story by Irvin S. Cobb, the g-g-g-greatest living humorist, and a new story of the prize-ring by J-J-Jack London. If you b-b-bought it in a book, it'd c-c-cost you a d-d- dollar-and-a-half. He had, besides these chance victims, an extensive clientry among the townsfolk.",1
437,"Swinging briskly and cheerily down the street, full of greetings and glib repartee, he would accost each of the grinning men by a new title, in a rich stammering tenor voice:  ""Colonel, how are you! Major--here you are, a week's reading hot off the press. Captain, how's the boy?""  ""How are you, son?""  ""Couldn't be better, General--slick as a puppy's belly!",1
438,"And they would roar with wheezing, red-faced, Southern laughter:  ""By God, he's a good 'un. Here, son, give me one of the damn things. I don't want it, but I'll buy it just to hear you talk. He was full of pungent and racy vulgarity: he had, more than any of the family, a Rabelaisian earthiness that surged in him with limitless energy, charging his tongue with unpremeditated comparisons, Gargantuan metaphors.",1
439,"Finally, he wet the bed every night in spite of Eliza's fretting complaints: it was the final touch of his stuttering, whistling, cheerful, vital, and comic personality--he was Luke, the unique, Luke, the incomparable: he was, in spite of his garrulous and fidgeting nervousness, an intensely likable person--and he really had in him a bottomless well of affection. He wanted bounteous praise for his acts, but he had a deep, genuine kindliness and tenderness. Every week, on Thursday, in Gant's dusty little office, he would gather the grinning cluster of small boys who bought The Post from him, and harangue them before he sent them out on their duties:  ""Well, have you thought of what you're going to tell them yet?",1
440,"You know you can't sit around on your little tails and expect them to look you up. Have you got a spiel worked out yet? How do you approach 'em, eh?"" he said, turning fiercely to a stricken small boy. Speak up, speak up, G-G-G-God-damn it--don't s-s-stand there looking at me.  Haw! he said, laughing with sudden wild idiocy, ""look at that face, won't you?""  Gant surveyed the proceedings from afar with Jannadeau, grinning.",1
441,"All right, Christopher Columbus,"" continued Luke, good-humoredly. What do you tell 'em, son?""  The boy cleared his throat timidly:  ""Mister, do you want to buy a copy of The Saturday Evening Post?""  ""Oh, twah-twah,"" said Luke, with mincing delicacy, as the boys sniggered, ""sweet twah-twah! Do you expect them to buy with a spiel like that? My God, where are your brains? Sail into them. Tackle them, and don't take no for an answer. Don't ask them if they WANT to buy. Dive into them:  'Here you are, sir--hot off the press.' Jesus Christ,"" he yelled, looking at the distant court- house clock with sudden fidget, ""we should have been out an hour ago. Come on--don't stand there: here are your papers. How many do you want, you little Kike?""--for he had several Jews in his employ: they worshipped him and he was very fond of them--he liked their warmth, richness, humor.",1
442,"Twenty.""  ""Twenty!"" he yelled. You little loafer--you'll t-t-take fifty. G-g-go on, you c-c-can sell 'em this afternoon. By G-G-God, papa,"" he said, pointing to the Jews, as Gant entered the office, ""it l-l- looks like the Last S-S-Supper, don't it? All right! he said, smacking across the buttocks a small boy who had bent for his quota. Don't stick it in my face. They shrieked with laughter. Dive in to them now. Don't let 'em get away from you. And, laughing and excited, he would send them out into the streets.",1
443,"To this land of employment and this method of exploitation Eugene was now initiated. He loathed the work with a deadly, an inexplicable loathing. But something in him festered deeply at the idea of disposing of his wares by the process of making such a wretched little nuisance of himself that riddance was purchased only at the price of the magazine. He writhed with shame and humiliation, but he stuck desperately to his task, a queer curly- headed passionate little creature, who raced along by the side of an astonished captive, pouring out of his dark eager face a hurricane of language. And men, fascinated somehow by this strange eloquence from a little boy, bought.",1
444,"Sometimes the heavy paunch-bellied Federal judge, sometimes an attorney, a banker would take him home, bidding him to perform for their wives, the members of their families, giving him twenty-five cents when he was done, and dismissing him. What do you think of that! they said.",1
445,"His first and nearest sales made, in the town, he would make the long circle on the hills and in the woods along the outskirts, visiting the tubercular sanitariums, selling the magazines easily and quickly--""like hot cakes"" as Luke had it--to doctors and nurses, to white unshaven, sensitive-faced Jews, to the wisp of a rake, spitting his rotten lungs into a cup, to good-looking young women who coughed slightly from time to time, but who smiled at him from their chairs, and let their warm soft hands touch his slightly as they paid him. Once, at a hillside sanitarium, two young New York Jews had taken him to the room of one of them, closed the door behind him, and assaulted him, tumbling him on the bed, while one drew forth a pocket knife and informed him he was going to perform a caponizing operation on him. They were two young men bored with the hills, the town, the deadly regime of their treatment, and it occurred to him years later that they had concocted the business, days ahead, in their dull lives, living for the excitement and terror they would arouse in him. His response was more violent than they had bargained for: he went mad with fear, screamed, and fought insanely. They were weak as cats, he squirmed out of their grasp and off the bed cuffing and clawing tigerishly, striking and kicking them with blind and mounting rage. He was released by a nurse who unlocked the door and led him out into the sunlight, the two young consumptives, exhausted and frightened, remaining in their room. He was nauseated by fear and by the impacts of his fists on their leprous bodies.",1
446,"But the little mound of nickels and dimes and quarters chinked pleasantly in his pockets: leg-weary and exhausted he would stand before a gleaming fountain burying his hot face in an iced drink. Sometimes conscience-tortured, he would steal an hour away from the weary streets and go into the library for a period of enchantment and oblivion: he was often discovered by his watchful and bustling brother, who drove him out to his labor again, taunting and spurring him into activity. Wake up! You're not in Fairyland. Go after them. Eugene's face was of no use to him as a mask: it was a dark pool in which every pebble of thought and feeling left its circle--his shame, his distaste for his employment was obvious, although he tried to conceal it: he was accused of false pride, told that he was ""afraid of a little honest work,"" and reminded of the rich benefits he had received from his big-hearted parents.",1
447,"He turned desperately to Ben. Sometimes Ben, loping along the streets of the town, met him, hot, tired, dirty, wearing his loaded canvas bag, scowled fiercely at him, upbraided him for his unkempt appearance, and took him into a lunch-room for something to eat-- rich foaming milk, fat steaming kidney-beans, thick apple-pie.  Both Ben and Eugene were by nature aristocrats. Eugene had just begun to feel his social status--or rather his lack of one; Ben had felt it for years. The feeling at bottom might have resolved itself simply into a desire for the companionship of elegant and lovely women: neither was able, nor would have dared, to confess this, and Eugene was unable to confess that he was susceptible to the social snub, or the pain of caste inferiority: any suggestion that the companionship of elegant people was preferable to the fellowship of a world of Tarkintons, and its blousy daughters, would have been hailed with heavy ridicule by the family, as another indication of false and undemocratic pride. He would have been called ""Mr. Vanderbilt"" or ""the Prince of Wales. Ben, however, was not to be intimidated by their cant, or deceived by their twaddle.",1
448,"He saw them with bitter clarity, answered their pretensions with soft mocking laughter, and a brief nod upwards and to the side of the companion to whom he communicated all his contemptuous observation--his dark satiric angel: Oh, my God! Listen to that, won't you?""  There was behind his scowling quiet eyes, something strange and fierce and unequivocal that frightened them: besides, he had secured for himself the kind of freedom they valued most--the economic freedom--and he spoke as he felt, answering their virtuous reproof with fierce quiet scorn. One day, he stood, smelling of nicotine, before the fire, scowling darkly at Eugene who, grubby and tousled, had slung his heavy bag over his shoulder, and was preparing to depart.",1
449,"Come here, you little bum,"" he said. When did you wash your hands last? Scowling fiercely, he made a sudden motion as if to strike the boy, but he finished instead by re-tying, with his hard delicate hands, his tie.",1
450,"In God's name, mama,"" he burst out irritably to Eliza, ""haven't you got a clean shirt to give him? You know, he ought to have one every month or so. What do you mean?",1
451,"What do you mean?"" said Eliza with comic rapidity, looking up from a basket of socks she was darning. I gave him that one last Tuesday. You little thug!",1
452,"he growled, looking at Eugene with a fierce pain in his eyes. Mama, for heaven's sake, why don't you send him to the barber's to get that lousy hair cut off? By God, I'll pay for it, if you don't want to spend the money. She pursed her lips angrily and continued to darn.",1
453,"Eugene looked at him dumbly, gratefully. After Eugene had gone, the quiet one smoked moodily for a time, drawing the fragrant smoke in long gulps down into his thin lungs. Eliza, recollective and hurt at what had been said, worked on.",1
454,"What are you trying to do with your kid, mama? he said in a hard quiet voice, after a silence. Do you want to make a tramp out of him? What do you mean?",1
455,"What do you mean?""  ""Do you think it's right to send him out on the streets with every little thug in town? Why, I don't know what you're talking about, boy,"" she said impatiently. It's no disgrace for a boy to do a little honest work, and no one thinks so. Oh, my God,"" he said to the dark angel.",1
456,"Listen to that! Eliza pursed her lips without speaking for a time. Pride goeth before a fall,"" she said after a moment. Pride goeth before a fall. I can't see that that makes much difference to us,"" said he.",1
457,"We've got no place to fall to. I consider myself as good as any one,"" she said, with dignity. I hold my head up with any one I meet. Oh, my God,"" Ben said to his angel.",1
458,"You don't meet any one. I don't notice any of your fine brothers or their wives coming to see you. This was true, and it hurt.",1
459,"She pursed her lips. No, mama,"" he continued after a moment's pause, ""you and the Old Man have never given a damn what we've done so long as you thought you might save a nickel by it. Why, I don't know what you're talking about, boy,"" she answered.",1
460,"You talk as if you thought we were Rich Folks. Beggars can't be choosers. Oh, my God,"" he laughed bitterly.",1
461,"You and the Old Man like to make out you're paupers, but you've a sock full of money. I don't know what you mean,"" she said angrily. No,"" he said, with his frequent negative beginning, after a moody silence, ""there are people in this town without a fifth what we've got who get twice as much out of it. The rest of us have never had anything, but I don't want to see the kid made into a little tramp. There was a long silence.",1
462,"She darned bitterly, pursing her lips frequently, hovering between quiet and tears. I never thought,"" she began after a long pause, her mouth tremulous with a bitter hurt smile, ""that I should live to hear such talk from a son of mine. You had better watch out,"" she hinted darkly, ""a day of reckoning cometh. As sure as you live, as sure as you live. You will be repaid threefold for your unnatural,"" her voice sank to a tearful whisper, ""your UNNATURAL conduct! She wept easily.",1
463,"Oh, my God,"" answered Ben, turning his lean, gray, bitter, bumpy face up toward his listening angel. Listen to that, won't you?""    11   Eliza saw Altamont not as so many hills, buildings, people: she saw it in the pattern of a gigantic blueprint. She knew the history of every piece of valuable property--who bought it, who sold it, who owned it in 1893, and what it was now worth. She watched the tides of traffic cannily; she knew by what corners the largest number of people passed in a day or an hour; she was sensitive to every growing-pain of the young town, gauging from year to year its growth in any direction, and deducing the probable direction of its future expansion. She judged distances critically, saw at once where the beaten route to an important centre was stupidly circuitous, and looking in a straight line through houses and lots, she said:  ""There'll be a street through here some day.",1
464,"Her vision of land and population was clear, crude, focal--there was nothing technical about it: it was extraordinary for its direct intensity. Her instinct was to buy cheaply where people would come; to keep out of pockets and culs de sac, to buy on a street that moved toward a centre, and that could be given extension. Thus, she began to think of Dixieland. It was situated five minutes from the public square, on a pleasant sloping middle-class street of small homes and boarding-houses. Dixieland was a big cheaply constructed frame house of eighteen or twenty drafty high- ceilinged rooms: it had a rambling, unplanned, gabular appearance, and was painted a dirty yellow. It had a pleasant green front yard, not deep but wide, bordered by a row of young deep-bodied maples: there was a sloping depth of one hundred and ninety feet, a frontage of one hundred and twenty. And Eliza, looking toward the town, said:  ""They'll put a street behind there some day. In winter, the wind blew howling blasts under the skirts of Dixieland: its back end was built high off the ground on wet columns of rotting brick.",1
465,"Its big rooms were heated by a small furnace which sent up, when charged with fire, a hot dry enervation to the rooms of the first floor, and a gaseous but chill radiation to those upstairs. The place was for sale. Its owner was a middle-aged horse-faced gentleman whose name was the Reverend Wellington Hodge: he had begun life favorably in Altamont as a Methodist minister, but had run foul of trouble when he began to do double service to the Lord God of Hosts and John Barleycorn--his evangelical career came to an abrupt ending one winter's night when the streets were dumb with falling snow. Wellington, clad only in his winter heavies, made a wild sortie from Dixieland at two in the morning, announcing the kingdom of God and the banishment of the devil, in a mad marathon through the streets that landed him panting but victorious in front of the Post Office. Since then, with the assistance of his wife, he had eked out a hard living at the boarding-house. Now, he was spent, disgraced, and weary of the town.",1
466,"Besides, the sheltering walls of Dixieland inspired him with horror--he felt that the malign influence of the house had governed his own disintegration. He was a sensitive man, and his promenades about his estate were checked by inhibited places: the cornice of the long girdling porch where a lodger had hanged himself one day at dawn, the spot in the hall where the consumptive had collapsed in a hemorrhage, the room where the old man cut his throat. He wanted to return to his home, a land of fast horses, wind-bent grass, and good whisky--Kentucky. He was ready to sell Dixieland.",1
467,"Eliza pursed her lips more and more thoughtfully, went to town by way of Spring Street more and more often. That's going to be a good piece of property some day,"" she said to Gant. He made no complaint. He felt suddenly the futility of opposing an implacable, an inexorable desire.",1
468,"Do you want it?"" he said. She pursed her lips several times:  ""It's a good buy,"" she said. You'll never regret it as long as you live, W. O.,"" said Dick Gudger, the agent.",1
469,"It's her house, Dick,"" said Gant wearily. Make out the papers in her name. She looked at him.",1
470,"I never want to own another piece of property as long as I live,"" said Gant. It's a curse and a care, and the tax-collector gets all you have in the end. Eliza pursed her lips and nodded.",1
471,She bought the place for seventy-five hundred dollars. She had enough money to make the first payment of fifteen hundred. The balance was to be paid in installments of fifteen hundred dollars a year. This she knew she had to pay chiefly from the earnings of the house.,1
472,"In the young autumn when the maples were still full and green, and the migratory swallows filled secretly the trees with clamor, and swooped of an evening in a black whirlwind down, drifting at its funnel end, like dead leaves, into their chosen chimney, Eliza moved into Dixieland. There was clangor, excitement, vast curiosity in the family about the purchase, but no clear conception of what had really happened. Gant and Eliza, although each felt dumbly that they had come to a decisive boundary in their lives, talked vaguely about their plans, spoke of Dixieland evasively as ""a good investment,"" said nothing clearly. In fact, they felt their approaching separation instinctively: Eliza's life was moving by a half-blind but inevitable gravitation toward the centre of its desire--the exact meaning of her venture she would have been unable to define, but she had a deep conviction that the groping urge which had led her so blindly into death and misery at Saint Louis had now impelled her in the right direction. Her life was on the rails.",1
473,"And however vaguely, confusedly, and casually they approached this complete disruption of their life together, the rooting up of their clamorous home, when the hour of departures came, the elements resolved themselves immutably and without hesitation. Eliza took Eugene with her. He was the last tie that bound her to all the weary life of breast and cradle; he still slept with her of nights; she was like some swimmer who ventures out into a dark and desperate sea, not wholly trusting to her strength and destiny, but with a slender cord bound to her which stretches still to land.",1
474,"With scarcely a word spoken, as if it had been known anciently and forever, Helen stayed with Gant. The time for Daisy's marriage was growing near: she had been sought by a tall middle-aged shaven life-insurance agent, who wore spats, collars of immaculate starchiness five inches in height, who spoke with an unctuous and insane croon, chortling gently in his throat from time to time for no reason at all. His name was Mr. McKissem, and she had screwed up enough courage, after an arduous siege, to refuse him, upon the private grounds of insanity.",1
475,"She had promised herself to a young South Carolinian, who was connected rather vaguely with the grocery trade. His hair was parted in the middle of his low forehead, his voice was soft, drawling, amiable, his manner hearty and insistent, his habits large and generous. He brought Gant cigars on his visits, the boys large boxes of assorted candies. Every one felt that he had favorable prospects.",1
476,"As for the others--Ben and Luke only--they were left floating in limbo; for Steve, since his eighteenth year, had spent most of his life away from home, existing for months by semi-vagabondage, scrappy employment, and small forgeries upon his father, in New Orleans, Jacksonville, Memphis, and reappearing to his depressed family after long intervals by telegraphing that he was desperately sick or, through the intermediacy of a crony who borrowed the title of ""doctor"" for the occasion, that he was dying, and would come home in a box if he was not sent for in the emaciated flesh. Thus, before he was eight, Eugene gained another roof and lost forever the tumultuous, unhappy, warm centre of his home. He had from day to day no clear idea where the day's food, shelter, lodging was to come from, although he was reasonably sure it would be given: he ate wherever he happened to hang his hat, either at Gant's or at his mother's; occasionally, although infrequently, he slept with Luke in the sloping, alcoved, gabled back room, rude with calcimine, with the high drafty steps that slanted to the kitchen porch, with the odor of old stacked books in packing-cases, with the sweet orchard scents. There were two beds; he exulted in his unaccustomed occupancy of an entire mattress, dreaming of the day of manlike privacy. But Eliza did not allow this often: he was riven into her flesh.",1
477,"Forgetful of him during the day's press, she summoned him at night over the telephone, demanding his return, and upbraiding Helen for keeping him. There was a bitter submerged struggle over him between Eliza and her daughter: absorbed in the management of Dixieland for days, she would suddenly remember his absence from meals, and call for him angrily across the phone. Good heavens, mama,"" Helen would answer irritably. He's your child, not mine. I'm not going to see him starve. What do you mean?",1
478,"What do you mean? He ran off while dinner was on the table. I've got a good meal fixed for him here. H-m! A GOOD meal. Helen put her hand over the mouthpiece, making a face at him as he stood catlike and sniggering by, burlesquing the Pentland manner, tone, mouthing.",1
479,"H-m!  Why, law me, child, yes--it's GOOD soup. He was convulsed silently. And then aloud: Well, it's your own lookout, not mine. If he doesn't want to stay up there, I can't help it. When he returned to Dixieland, Eliza would question him with bitter working lips; she would prick at his hot pride in an effort to keep him by her.",1
480,"What do you mean by running off to your papa's like that? If I were you, I'd have too much pride for that. I'd be a-sha-a-med!"" Her face worked with a bitter hurt smile. Helen can't be bothered with you. She doesn't want you around.",1
481,"But the powerful charm of Gant's house, of its tacked and added whimsy, its male smell, its girdling rich vines, its great gummed trees, its roaring internal seclusiveness, the blistered varnish, the hot calfskin, the comfort and abundance, seduced him easily away from the great chill tomb of Dixieland, particularly in winter, since Eliza was most sparing of coal. Gant had already named it ""The Barn""; in the morning now, after his heavy breakfast at home, he would swing gauntly toward town by way of Spring Street, composing en route the invective that he had formerly reserved to his sitting-room. He would stride through the wide chill hall of Dixieland, bursting in upon Eliza, and two or three negresses, busy preparing the morning meal for the hungry boarders who rocked energetically upon the porch. All of the objections, all of the abuse that had not been uttered when she bought the place, were vented now.",1
482,"Woman, you have deserted my bed and board, you have made a laughing stock of me before the world, and left your children to perish. Fiend that you are, there is nothing that you would not do to torture, humiliate and degrade me. You have deserted me in my old age; you have left me to die alone. Ah, Lord! It was a bitter day for us all when your gloating eyes first fell upon this damnable, this awful, this murderous and bloody Barn. There is no ignominy to which you will not stoop if you think it will put a nickel in your pocket. You have fallen so low not even your own brothers will come near you. 'Nor beast, nor man hath fallen so far.' And in the pantries, above the stove, into the dining-room, the rich voices of the negresses chuckled with laughter.",1
483,"Dat man sho' can tawk!""  Eliza got along badly with the negroes. She had all the dislike and distrust for them of the mountain people. Moreover, she had never been used to service, and she did not know how to accept or govern it graciously. She nagged and berated the sullen negro girls constantly, tortured by the thought that they were stealing her supplies and her furnishings, and dawdling away the time for which she paid them. And she paid them reluctantly, dribbling out their small wages a coin or two at a time, nagging them for their laziness and stupidity.",1
484,"What have you been doing all this time? Did you get those back rooms done upstairs? No'm,"" said the negress sullenly, slatting flatfootedly down the kitchen.",1
485,"I'll vow,"" Eliza fretted. I never saw such a good-for-nothing shiftless darkey in my life. You needn't think I'm going to pay you for wasting your time. This would go on throughout the day.",1
486,"As a result, Eliza would often begin the day without a servant: the girls departed at night muttering sullenly, and did not appear the next morning. Moreover, her reputation for bickering pettiness spread through the length and breadth of Niggertown. It became increasingly difficult for her to find any one at all who would work for her. Completely flustered when she awoke to find herself without help, she would immediately call Helen over the telephone, pouring her fretful story into the girl's ear and entreating assistance:  ""I'll declare, child, I don't know what I'm going to do.",1
487,"I could wring that worthless nigger's neck. Here I am left all alone with a house full of people. Mama, in heaven's name, what's the matter?",1
488,"Can't you keep a nigger in the house? Other people do. What do you do to them, anyway? But, fuming and irritable, she would leave Gant's and go to her mother's, serving the tables with large heartiness, nervous and animated good-humor.",1
489,"All the boarders were very fond of her: they said she was a fine girl. Every one did. There was a spacious and unsparing generosity about her, a dominant consuming vitality, which ate at her poor health, her slender supply of strength, so that her shattered nerves drew her frequently toward hysteria, and sometimes toward physical collapse. She was almost six feet tall: she had large hands and feet, thin straight legs, a big-boned generous face, with the long full chin slightly adroop, revealing her big gold-traced upper teeth. But, in spite of this gauntness, she did not look hard-featured or raw-boned. Her face was full of heartiness and devotion, sensitive, whole-souled, hurt, bitter, hysterical, but at times transparently radiant and handsome.",1
490,"It was a spiritual and physical necessity for her to exhaust herself in service for others, and it was necessary for her to receive heavy slatherings of praise for that service, and especially necessary that she feel her efforts had gone unappreciated. Even at the beginning, she would become almost frantic reciting her grievances, telling the story of her service to Eliza in a voice that became harsh and hysterical:  ""Let the least little thing go wrong and she's at the phone. It's not my place to go up there and work like a nigger for a crowd of old cheap boarders. You know that, don't you?  DON'T you?""  ""Yes'm,"" said Eugene, meekly serving as audience.",1
491,"But she'd die rather than admit it. Do you ever hear her say a word of thanks? Do I get,"" she said laughing suddenly, her hysteria crossed for the moment with her great humor, ""do I get so much as 'go-to-hell' for it?""  ""NO!"" squealed Eugene, going off in fits of idiot laughter.",1
492,"Why, law me, child. H-m! Yes. It's GOOD soup,"" said she, touched with her great earthy burlesque.",1
493,"He tore his collar open, and undid his trousers, sliding to the floor in an apoplexy of laughter. Sdop!  Sdop! You're g-g-gilling me! H-m!  Why, law me!",1
494,"Yes,"" she continued, grinning at him as if she hoped to succeed. Nevertheless, whether Eliza was servantless or not, she went daily at dinner, the mid-day meal, to help at table, and frequently at night when Gant and the boys ate with Eliza instead of at home. She went because of her deep desire to serve, because it satisfied her need for giving more than was returned, and because, in spite of her jibes, along with Gant, at the Barn, and the ""cheap boarders,"" the animation of feeding, the clatter of plates, the braided clamor of their talk, stimulated and excited her.",1
495,"Like Gant, like Luke, she needed extension in life, movement, excitement: she wanted to dominate, to entertain, to be the life of the party. On small solicitation, she sang for the boarders, thumping the cheap piano with her heavy accurate touch, and singing in her strong, vibrant, somewhat hard soprano a repertory of songs classical, sentimental, and comic. Eugene remembered the soft cool nights of summer, the assembled boarders and ""I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now,"" which Gant demanded over and over; ""Love Me and the World Is Mine""; ""Till the Sands of the Desert Grow Cold""; ""Dear Old Girl, the Rob-BIN Sings Above You""; ""The End of a Perfect Day""; and ""Alexander's Rag-Time Band,"" which Luke had practised in a tortured house for weeks, and sung with thunderous success in the High School Minstrels.",1
496,"Later, in the cool dark, Gant, rocking violently, would hold forth on the porch, his great voice carrying across the quiet neighborhood, as he held the charmed boarders by his torrential eloquence, his solution of problems of state, his prejudiced but bold opinion upon current news. --And what did WE do, gentlemen? We sank their navy in an action that lasted only twenty minutes, stormed at by shot and shell, Teddy and his Rough Riders took the hill at Santiago--it was all over, as you well know, in a few months. We had declared war with no thought of ulterior gain; we came because the indignation of a GREAT people had been aroused at the oppression of a smaller one, and then, with a magnanimity well worthy the greatest people of the face of the earth, we paid our defeated enemy twenty millions of dollars. Ah, Lord! That was magnanimity indeed! You don't think any other nation would have done that, do you?""  ""No, sir,"" said the boarders emphatically.",1
497,"They didn't always agree with his political opinions--Roosevelt was the faultless descendant of Julius Cæsar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Abraham Lincoln--but they felt he had a fine head and would have gone far in politics. That man should have been a lawyer,"" said the boarders. And yet, there was surging into these chosen hills the strong thrust of the world, like a kissing tide, which swings lazily in with a slapping glut of waters, and recoils into its parent crescent strength, to be thrown farther inward once again.",1
498,"It was an element of Eliza's primitive and focal reasoning that men and women withered by the desert would seek an oasis, that those who were thirsty would seek water, and that those panting on the plains would look into the hills for comfort and relief. She had that bull's-eye accuracy which has since been celebrated, when plum-picking's over, under the name of ""vision. The streets, ten years before raw clay, were being paved: Gant went into frenzies over the paving assessments, cursed the land, the day of his birth, the machinations of Satan's children.",1
499,"But Eugene followed the wheeled casks of boiling tar; watched the great roller, a monster that crushed him in night-mares, powder the layered rock; felt, as he saw the odorous pressed tongue of pavement lengthen out, a swelling ecstasy. From time to time, a stilted Cadillac gasped cylindrically up the hill past Dixieland: Eugene said a spell, as it faltered, for its success--Jim Sawyer, a young blood, came for Miss Cutler, the Pittsburgh beauty: he opened a door behind in the fat red belly. They got in.",1
500,"Sometimes, when Eliza awoke to find her servants gone, he was sent down into Niggertown to capture a new one: in that city of rickets he searched into their fetid shacks, past the slow stench of little rills of mire and sewage, in fetid cellars, through all the rank labyrinth of the hill-sprawled settlement. He came, in the hot sealed dungeons of their rooms, to know the wild grace of their bodies, thrown upon a bed, their rich laughter, their smell of the jungle tropics stewed in with frying cookery and a boiling wash. Do you want a job? Whose little boy are you?""  ""Mrs. Eliza Gant's.",1
501,"Silence. Presently:  ""Dere's a gal up de street at Mis' Cawpening's who's lookin' fo' wuk. YOU go see HUH. Eliza watched them with a falcon's eye for thefts.",1
502,"Once, with a detective, she searched a departed girl's room in Niggertown, finding there sheets, towels, spoons that had been stolen from her. The girl went to the penitentiary for two years. Eliza loved the commotion of law, the smell and tension of the courts. Whenever she could go to law she did so: she delighted in bringing suit against people, or in having suit brought against her. She always won.",1
503,"When her boarders defaulted payments she seized their belongings triumphantly, delighting particularly in eleventh-hour captures at the railway station, with the aid of an obedient constabulary, and ringed by the attentive offal of the town. Eugene was ashamed of Dixieland. And he was again afraid to express his shame. As with The Post, he felt thwarted, netted, trapped. He hated the indecency of his life, the loss of dignity and seclusion, the surrender to the tumultuous rabble of the four walls which shield us from them. He felt, rather than understood, the waste, the confusion, the blind cruelty of their lives--his spirit was stretched out on the rack of despair and bafflement as there came to him more and more the conviction that their lives could not be more hopelessly distorted, wrenched, mutilated, and perverted away from all simple comfort, repose, happiness, if they set themselves deliberately to tangle the skein, twist the pattern. He choked with fury: he thought of Eliza's slow speech, her endless reminiscence, her maddening lip-pursing, and turned white with constricted rage.",1
504,"He saw plainly by this time that their poverty, the threat of the poorhouse, the lurid references to the pauper's grave, belonged to the insensate mythology of hoarding; anger smouldered like a brand in him at their sorry greed. There was no place sacred unto themselves, no place fixed for their own inhabitation, no place proof against the invasion of the boarders. As the house filled, they went from room to little room, going successively down the shabby scale of their lives. He felt it would hurt them, coarsen them: he had even then an intense faith in food, in housing, in comfort--he felt that a civilized man must begin with them; he knew that wherever the spirit had withered, it had not withered because of food and plumbing.",1
505,"As the house filled, in the summer season, and it was necessary to wait until the boarders had eaten before a place could be found for him, he walked sullenly about beneath the propped back porch of Dixieland, savagely exploring the dark cellar, or the two dank windowless rooms which Eliza rented, when she could, to negresses. He felt now the petty cruelty of village caste. On Sunday for several years, he had bathed, brushed, arrayed his anointed body in clean underwear and shirting and departed, amid all the pleasurable bustle of Sunday morning, for the Presbyterian Sunday School. He had by this time been delivered from the instruction of the several spinsters who had taught his infant faith the catechism, the goodness of God, and the elements of celestial architecture. The five-cent piece which formerly he had yielded up reluctantly, thinking of cakes and ale, he now surrendered more gladly, since he usually had enough left over for cold gaseous draughts at the soda- fountain.",1
506,"In the fresh Sunday morning air he marched off with brisk excitement to do duty at the altars, pausing near the church where the marshalled ranks of the boys' military school split cleanly into regimented Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians. The children assembled in a big room adjacent to the church, honey- combed to right and left with small classrooms, which they entered after the preliminary service was finished. They were exhorted from the platform by the superintendent, a Scotch dentist with a black-gray beard, fringed by a small area of embalmed skin, whose cells, tissues, and chemical juices seemed to have been fixed in a state of ageless suspension, and who looked no older from one decade to another.",1
507,"He read the text, or the parable of the day's study, commented on it with Cæsarean dryness and concision, and surrendered the service to his assistant, a shaven, spectacled, Wilsonian-looking man, also Scotch, who smiled with cold affection at them over his high shiny collar, and led them through the verses of a hymn, heaving up his arms and leering at them encouragingly, as they approached the chorus. A sturdy spinstress thumped heavily upon a piano which shook like a leaf. Eugene liked the high crystal voices of the little children, backed by the substantial marrow of the older boys and girls, and based on the strong volume of the Junior and Senior Baraccas and Philatheas. They sang:        ""Throw out the lifeline, throw out the lifeline,       Someone is sinking to-day-ee""--   on the mornings when the collection went for missionary work.",1
508,"And they sang:        ""Shall we gather at the river,       The bew-tee-ful, the bew-tee-ful r-hiver. He liked that one very much. And the noble surge of ""Onward, Christian Soldiers. Later, he went into one of the little rooms with his class.",1
509,"The sliding doors rumbled together all around; presently there was a quiet drone throughout the building. He was now in a class composed entirely of boys. His teacher was a tall white-faced young man, bent and thin, who was known to all the other boys as secretary of the Y.M.C.A. He was tubercular; but the boys admired him because of his former skill as a baseball and basketball player. He spoke in a sad, sugary, whining voice; he was oppressively Christ-like; he spoke to them intimately about the lesson of the day, asking them what it might teach them in their daily lives, in acts of obedience and love to their parents and friends, in duty, courtesy, and Christian charity. And he told them that when they were in doubt about their conduct they should ask themselves what Jesus would say: he spoke of Jesus often in his melancholy, somewhat discontented voice--Eugene became vaguely miserable as he talked, thinking of something soft, furry, with a wet tongue.",1
510,"He was nervous and constrained: the other boys knew one another intimately--they lived on, or in the neighborhood of, Montgomery Avenue, which was the most fashionable street in town. Sometimes, one of them said to him, grinning:  ""Do you want to buy The Saturday Evening Post, Mister?""  Eugene, during the week, never touched the lives of any of them, even in a remote way. His idea of their eminence was grossly exaggerated; the town had grown rapidly from a straggling village-- it had few families as old as the Pentlands, and, like all resort towns, its caste system was liquidly variable, depending chiefly upon wealth, ambition, and boldness.",1
511,"Harry Tarkinton and Max Isaacs were Baptists, as were most of the people, the Scotch excepted, in Gant's neighborhood. In the social scale the Baptists were the most populous and were considered the most common: their minister was a large plump man with a red face and a white vest, who reached great oratorical effects, roaring at them like a lion, cooing at them like a dove, introducing his wife into the sermon frequently for purposes of intimacy and laughing, in a programme which the Episcopalians, who held the highest social eminence, and the Presbyterians, less fashionable, but solidly decent, felt was hardly chaste. The Methodists occupied the middle ground between vulgarity and decorum.",1
512,"This starched and well brushed world of Sunday morning  Presbyterianism, with its sober decency, its sense of restraint, its suggestion of quiet wealth, solid position, ordered ritual, seclusive establishment, moved him deeply with its tranquillity. He felt concretely his isolation from it, he entered it from the jangled disorder of his own life once a week, looking at it, and departing from it, for years, with the sad heart of a stranger. And from the mellow gloom of the church, the rich distant organ, the quiet nasal voice of the Scotch minister, the interminable prayers, and the rich little pictures of Christian mythology which he had collected as a child under the instruction of the spinsters, he gathered something of the pain, the mystery, the sensuous beauty of religion, something deeper and greater than this austere decency.",1
513,"12   It was the winter, and the sullen dying autumn that he hated most at Dixieland--the dim fly-specked lights, the wretched progress about the house in search of warmth, Eliza untidily wrapped in an old sweater, a dirty muffler, a cast-off man's coat. She glycerined her cold-cracked hands. The chill walls festered with damp: they drank in death from the atmosphere: a woman died of typhoid, her husband came quickly out into the hall and dropped his hands. They were Ohio people.",1
514,"Upstairs, upon a sleeping porch, a thin-faced Jew coughed through the interminable dark. In heaven's name, mama,"" Helen fumed, ""why do you take them in? Can't you see he's got the bugs?""  ""Why, no-o,"" said Eliza, pursing her lips.",1
515,"He said he only had a little bronchial trouble. I asked him about it, and he laughed just as big as you please:  'Why, Mrs. Gant,' he said--"" and there would follow an endless anecdote, embellished with many a winding rivulet. The girl raged: it was one of Eliza's basic traits to defend blindly whatever brought her money.",1
516,"The Jew was a kind man. He coughed gently behind his white hand and ate bread fried in battered egg and butter. Eugene developed a keen appetite for it: innocently he called it ""Jew Bread"" and asked for more. Lichenfels laughed gently, coughed--his wife was full of swart rich laughter. The boy did small services for him: he gave him a coin from week to week. He was a clothier from a New Jersey town. In the Spring he went to a sanitarium; he died there later.",1
517,"In the winter a few chill boarders, those faces, those personalities which become mediocre through repetition, sat for hours before the coals of the parlor hearth, rocking interminably, dull of voice and gesture, as hideously bored with themselves and Dixieland, no doubt, as he with them. He liked the summers better. There came slow-bodied women from the hot rich South, dark-haired white-bodied girls from New Orleans, corn-haired blondes from Georgia, nigger-drawling desire from South Carolina. And there was malarial lassitude, tinged faintly with yellow, from Mississippi but with white biting teeth. A red-faced South Carolinian, with nicotined fingers, took him daily to the baseball games; a lank yellow planter, malarial from Mississippi, climbed hill, and wandered through the fragrant mountain valleys with him; of nights he heard the rich laughter of the women, tender and cruel, upon the dark porches, heard the florid throat-tones of the men; saw the yielding stealthy harlotry of the South--the dark seclusion of their midnight bodies, their morning innocence. Desire, with bloody beak, tore at his heart like jealous virtue: he was moral for that which was denied him.",1
518,"Of mornings he stayed at Gant's with Helen playing ball with Buster Isaacs, a cousin of Max, a plump jolly little boy who lived next door; summoned later by the rich incense of Helen's boiling fudge. She sent him to the little Jewish grocery down the street for the sour relishes she liked so well: tabled in mid-morning they ate sour pickles, heavy slabs of ripe tomatoes, coated with thick mayonnaise, amber percolated coffee, fig-newtons and ladyfingers, hot pungent fudge pebbled with walnuts and coated fragrantly with butter, sandwiches of tender bacon and cucumber, iced belchy soft- drinks. His trust in her Gantian wealth was boundless: this rich store of delight came from inexhaustible resources. Warm lively hens cackled cheerfully throughout the morning neighborhood; powerful negroes brought dripping ice in iron talons from their smoking wagons; he stood beneath their droning saws and caught the flying ice-pulp in his hands; he drank in the combined odor of their great bodies together with the rich compost of the refrigeration, and the sharp oiliness of the dining-room linoleum; and in the horsehair walnut parlor at mid-day, good with the mellow piano-smell and the smell of stale varnished wood, she played for him, and made him sing:  ""William Tell,"" ""My Heart at Thy Sweet Voice,"" ""The Song Without Words,"" ""Celeste Aïda,"" ""The Lost Chord,"" her long throat lean and tendoned as her vibrant voice rang out.",1
519,"She took insatiable delight in him, stuffing him with sour and sugared relishes, tumbling him, in a random moment of her restless activity, upon Gant's lounge, and pinioning him while she slapped his squirming face sharply with her big hand. Sometimes, frantic with some swift tangle of her nerves, she would attack him viciously, hating him for his dark brooding face, his full scalloped underlip, his deep absorption in a dream. Like Luke, and like Gant, she sought in the world ceaseless entertainment for her restless biting vitality; it infuriated her to see other people seek absorption within themselves--she hated him at times when, her own wires strumming, she saw his dark face brooding over a book or on some vision. She would tear the book from his hands, slap him, and stab him with her cruel savage tongue. She would pout out her lip, goggle her face about stupidly on a drooping neck, assume an expression of dopey idiocy, and pour out on him the horrible torrent of her venom.",1
520,"You little freak--wandering around with your queer dopey face. You're a regular little Pentland--you funny little freak, you. Everybody's laughing at you. Don't you know that? Don't you? We're going to dress you up as a girl, and let you go around like that. You haven't got a drop of Gant blood in you--papa's practically said as much--you're Greeley all over again; you're queer. Pentland queerness sticking out all over you. Sometimes her sweltering and inchoate fury was so great that she threw him on the floor and stamped on him.",1
521,"He did not mind the physical assault so much as he did the poisonous hatred of her tongue, insanely clever in fashioning the most wounding barbs. He went frantic with horror, jerked unexpectedly from Elfland into Hell, he bellowed madly, saw his bountiful angel change in a moment to a snake-haired fury, lost all his sublime faith in love and goodness. He rushed at the wall like an insane little goat, battered his head screaming again and again, wished desperately that his constricted and overloaded heart would burst, that something in him would break, that somehow, bloodily, he might escape the stifling prisonhouse of his life.",1
522,"This satisfied her desire; it was what deeply she had wanted--she had found purging release in her savage attack upon him, and now she could drain herself cleanly in a wild smother of affection. She would seize him, struggling and screaming, in her long arms, plaster kisses all over his red mad face, soothing him with hearty flattery addressed in the third person:  ""Why, he didn't think I meant it, did he? Didn't he know I was only joking? Why, he's strong as a little bull, isn't he? He's a regular little giant, that's what he is. Why, he's perfectly wild, isn't he? His eyes popping out of his head. I thought he was going to knock a hole in the wall.--Yes, ma'am. Why, law me, yes, child. It's GOOD soup,"" resorting to her broad mimicry in order to make him laugh. And he would laugh against his will between his sobs, in a greater torture because of this agony of affection and reconciliation than because of the abuse.",1
523,"Presently, when he had grown quiet, she would send him off to the store for pickles, cakes, cold bottled drinks; he would depart with red eyes, his cheeks furrowed dirtily by his tears, wondering desperately as he went down the street why the thing had happened, and drawing his foot sharply off the ground and craning his neck convulsively as shame burnt in him. There was in Helen a restless hatred of dullness, respectability. Yet she was at heart a severely conventional person, in spite of her occasional vulgarity, which was merely a manifestation of her restless energy, a very naïve, a childishly innocent person about even the simple wickedness of the village. She had several devoted young men on her list--plain, hard-drinking country types: one, a native, lean, red-faced, alcoholic, a city surveyor, who adored her; another, a strapping florid blond from the Tennessee coal fields; another, a young South Carolinian, townsman of her older sister's fiancé.",1
524,"These young men--Hugh Parker, Jim Phelps, and Joe Cathcart, were innocently devoted; they liked her tireless and dominant energy, the eager monopoly of her tongue, her big sincerity and deep kindliness. She played and sang for them--threw all her energy into entertaining them. They brought her boxes of candy, little presents, were divided jealously among themselves, but united in their affirmation that she was ""a fine girl.",1
525,"And she would get Jim Phelps and Hugh Parker to bring her a drink of whisky as well: she had begun to depend on small potations of alcohol for the stimulus it gave her fevered body--a small drink was enough to operate electrically in her blood: it renewed her, energized her, gave her a temporary and hectic vitality. Thus, although she never drank much at a time and showed, beyond the renewed vitality and gaiety, no sign of intoxication, she nibbled at the bottle. I'll take a drink whenever I can get it,"" she said.",1
526,"She liked, almost invariably, young fast women. She liked the hectic pleasure of their lives, the sense of danger, their humor and liberality. She was drawn magnetically to all the wedded harlotry, which, escaping the Sunday discipline of a Southern village, and the Saturday lust of sodden husbands, came gaily to Altamont in summer. She liked people who, as she said, ""didn't mind taking a little drink now and then. She liked Mary Thomas, a tall jolly young prostitute who came from Kentucky: she was a manicurist in an Altamont Hotel.",1
527,"There are two things I want to see,"" said Mary, ""a rooster's you- know-what and a hen's what-is-it. She was full of loud compelling laughter. She had a small room with a sleeping porch, at the front of the house upstairs. Eugene brought her some cigarettes once: she stood before the window in a thin petticoat, her feet wide apart, her long sensual legs outlined against the light.",1
528,"Helen wore her dresses, hats, and silk stockings. Sometimes they drank together. And, with humorous sentimentality, she defended her.",1
529,"Well, she's no hypocrite. That's one thing sure. She doesn't care who knows it. Or,  ""She's no worse than a lot of your little goody-goodies, if the truth's known.",1
530,"She's only more open about it. Or again, irritated at some implied criticism of her own friendliness with the girl, she would say angrily:  ""What do you know about her? You'd better be careful how you talk about people. You'll get into trouble about it some day. Nevertheless, she was scrupulous in her public avoidance of the girl and, illogically, in a moment of unreasoning annoyance she would attack Eliza:  ""Why do you keep such people in your house, mama?",1
531,"Every one in town knows about her. Your place is getting the reputation of a regular chippyhouse all over town. Eliza pursed her lips angrily:  ""I don't pay any attention to them,"" she said.",1
532,"I consider myself as good as any one. I hold my head up, and I expect every one else to do likewise. You don't catch me associating with them. It was part of her protective mechanism.",1
533,"She pretended to be proudly oblivious to any disagreeable circumstance which brought her in money. As a result, by that curious impalpable advertisement which exists among easy women, Dixieland became known to them-- they floated casually in--the semi-public, clandestine prostitutes of a tourist town. Helen had drifted apart from most of her friends of high school days--the hard-working plain-faced Genevieve Pratt, daughter of a schoolmaster, ""Teeney"" Duncan, Gertrude Brown. Her companions now were livelier, if somewhat more vulgar, young women--Grace Deshaye, a plumber's daughter, an opulent blonde; Pearl Hines, daughter of a Baptist saddlemaker: she was heavy of body and face, but she had a powerful rag-time singing voice.",1
534,"Her closest companion, however, was a girl whose name was Nan Gudger: she was a brisk, slender, vital girl, with a waist so tightly corsetted that a man's hands might go around it. She was the trusted, accurate, infallible bookkeeper of a grocery store. She contributed largely to the support of her family--a mother whom Eugene looked upon with sick flesh, because of the heavy goitre that sagged from her loose neck; a crippled sister who moved about the house by means of crutches and the propulsive strength of her powerful shoulders; and two brothers, hulking young thugs of twenty and eighteen years, who always bore upon their charmed bodies fresh knife-wounds, blue lumps and swellings, and other marks of their fights in poolroom and brothel. They lived in a two-story shack of rickety lumber on Clingman Street: the women worked uncomplainingly in the support of the young men. Eugene went here with Helen often: she liked the vulgarity, the humor, the excitement of their lives--and it amused her particularly to listen to Mary's obscene earthy conversation.",1
535,"Upon the first of every month, Nan and Mary gave to the boys a portion of their earnings, for pocket money and for their monthly visit to the women of Eagle Crescent. Oh, SURELY not, Mary?  Good heavens!"" said Helen with eager unbelief. Why, hell yes, honey,"" said Mary, grinning her coarse drawl, taking her snuff-stick out of the brown corner of her mouth, and holding it in her strong hand. We always give the boys money fer a woman once a month. Oh, NO!",1
536,"You're joking,"" Helen said, laughing. Good God, child, don't you know THAT?"" said Mary, spitting inaccurately at the fire. Hit's good for their health. They'd git sick if we didn't. Eugene began to slide helplessly toward the floor.",1
537,"He got an instant panorama of the whole astonishing picture of humor and solemn superstition--the women contributing their money, in the interests of sanitation and health, to the debauches of the two grinning hairy nicotined young louts. What're you laughin' at, son?"" said Mary, gooching him roughly in the ribs, as he lay panting and prostrate. You ain't hardly out of didies yet. She had all the savage passion of a mountaineer: crippled, she lived in the coarse heat of her brothers' lust.",1
538,"They were crude, kindly, ignorant, and murderous people. Nan was scrupulously respectable and well-mannered: she had thick negroid lips that turned outward, and hearty tropical laughter. She replaced the disreputable furniture of the house by new shiny Grand Rapids chairs and tables. There was a varnished bookcase, forever locked, stored with stiff sets of unread books--The Harvard Classics, and a cheap encyclopædia.",1
539,"When Mrs. Selborne first came to Dixieland from the hot South she was only twenty-three but she looked older. Ripeness with her was all: she was a tall heavy-bodied blonde, well kept and elegant. She moved leisurely with a luxurious sensual swing of the body: her smile was tender and full of vague allurement, her voice gentle, her sudden laughter, bubbling out of midnight secrecy, rich and full. She was one of several handsome and bacchic daughters of a depleted South Carolinian of good family; she had married at sixteen a red heavy man who came and went from her incomparable table, eating rapidly and heartily, muttering, when pressed, a few shy-sullen words, and departing to the closed leather-and-horse smell of his little office in the livery-stable he owned. She had two children by him, both girls: she moved with wasted stealth around all the quiet slander of a South Carolina mill-town, committing adultery carefully with a mill owner, a banker, and a lumber man, walking circumspectly with her tender blonde smile by day past all the sly smiles of town and trade, knowing that the earth was mined below her feet, and that her name, with clerk and merchant, was a sign for secret laughter. The natives, the men in particular, treated her with even more elaborate respect than a woman is usually given in a Southern town, but their eyes, behind the courteous unctions of their masks, were shiny with invitation.",1
540,"Eugene felt when he first saw her, and knew about her, that she would never be caught and always known. His love for her was desperate. She was the living symbol of his desire--the dim vast figure of love and maternity, ageless and autumnal, waiting, corn- haired, deep-breasted, blonde of limb, in the ripe fields of harvest--Demeter, Helen, the ripe exhaustless and renewing energy, the cradling nurse of weariness and disenchantment. Below the thrust of Spring, the sharp knife, the voices of the young girls in the darkness, the sharp inchoate expectancies of youth, his deep desire burned inextinguishably: something turned him always to the older women.",1
541,"When Mrs. Selborne first came to Dixieland her oldest child was seven years old, her youngest five. She received a small check from her husband every week, and a substantial one from the lumber man. She brought a negro girl with her: she was lavish in her dispensations to the negress, and to her children: this wastefulness, ease of living, and her rich seductive laughter fascinated Helen, drew her to the older woman.",1
542,"And, at night, as Eugene listened to the low sweet voice of the woman, heard the rich sensual burst of her laughter, as she sat in the dark porch with a commercial traveller or some merchant in the town, his blood grew bitter with the morality of jealousy: he withered with his hurt, thought of her little sleeping children, and, with a passionate sense of fraternity, of her gulled husband. He dreamed of himself as the redemptive hero, saving her in an hour of great danger, making her penitent with grave reproof, accepting purely the love she offered. In the morning, he breathed the seminal odor of her fresh bathed body as she passed him, gazed desperately into the tender sensuality of her face and, with a sense of unreality, wondered what change darkness wrought in this untelling face.",1
543,"Steve returned from New Orleans after a year of vagabondage. The old preposterous swagger, following the ancient whine, reappeared as soon as he felt himself safely established at home again. Stevie doesn't have to work,"" said he. He's smart enough to make the others work for him. This was his defiance to his record of petty forgeries against Gant: he saw himself as a clever swindler although he had never had courage to swindle any one except his father. People were reading the Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford stories: there was an immense admiration for this romantic criminal.",1
544,"Steve was now a young man in the first twenties. He was somewhat above the middle height, bumpy of face and sallow of skin, with a light pleasing tenor voice. Eugene had a feeling of disgust and horror whenever his oldest brother returned: he knew that those who were physically least able to defend themselves, which included Eliza and himself, would bear the brunt of his whining, petty bullying, and drunken obscenity. He did not mind the physical abuse so much as he did its cowardly stealth, weakness, and slobbering reconciliations.",1
545,"Once, Gant, making one of his sporadic efforts to get his son fixed in employment, had sent him out to a country graveyard to put up a small monument. Eugene was sent along. Steve worked steadily in the hot sun for an hour, growing more and more irritable because of the heat, the rank weedy stench of the graveyard, and his own deep antipathy to work. Eugene waited intensely for the attack he knew was coming.",1
546,"What are you standing there for?"" screamed Big Brother at length, looking up in an agony of petulance. He struck sharply at the boy's shin with a heavy wrench he held in his hand, knocking him to the ground, and crippling him for the moment. Immediately, he was palsied, not with remorse, but with fear that he had injured him badly and would be discovered.",1
547,"You're not hurt, are you, buddy? You're not hurt?"" he began in a quivering voice, putting his unclean yellow hands upon Eugene. And he made the effort at reconciliation Eugene so dreaded, whimpering, blowing his foul breath upon his brother's cringing flesh, and entreating him to say nothing of the occurrence when he went home. Eugene became violently nauseated: the stale odor of Steve's body, the clammy and unhealthy sweat that stank with nicotine, the touch of his tainted flesh filled him with horror.",1
548,"There still remained, however, in the cast and carriage of his head, in his swagger walk, the ghost of his ruined boyishness: women were sometimes attracted to him. It was his fortune, therefore, to secure Mrs. Selborne for his mistress the first summer she came to Dixieland. At night her rich laughter welled up from the dark porch, they walked through the quiet leafy streets, they went to Riverside together, walking beyond the lights of the carnival into the dark sandy paths by the river.",1
549,"But, as her friendship with Helen ripened, as she saw the revulsion of the Gants against their brother, and as she began to see what damage she had already done to herself by her union with this braggart who had brandished her name through every poolroom in town as a tribute to his own power, she cast him off, quietly, implacably, tenderly. When she returned now, summer by summer, she met with her innocent and unwitting smile all of his obscene innuendoes, his heavily suggestive threats, his bitter revelations behind her back. Her affection for Helen was genuine, but it was also, she felt, strategic and useful. The girl introduced her to handsome young men, gave parties and dances at Gant's and Eliza's for her, was really a partner in her intrigues, assuring her of privacy, silence, and darkness, and defending her angrily when the evil whispering began.",1
550,"What do you know about her? You don't know what she does. You'd better be careful how you talk about her. She's got a husband to defend her, you know. You'll get your head shot off some day. Or, more doubtfully:  ""Well, I don't care what they say, I like her.",1
551,"She's mighty sweet. After all, what can we say about her for sure? No one can PROVE anything on her.",1
552,"And in the winters now she made short visits to the South Carolina town where Mrs. Selborne lived, returning with an enthusiastic description of her reception, the parties ""in her honor,"" the food, the lavish entertainment. Mrs. Selborne lived in the same town as Joe Gambell, the young clerk to whom Daisy was engaged. He was full of sly hints about the woman, but before her his manner was obsequious, confused, reverential, and he accepted without complaint the presents of food and clothing which she sent him after their marriage.",1
553,"Daisy had been married in the month of June following Eliza's purchase of Dixieland: the wedding was arranged on a lavish scale, and took place in the big dining-room of the house. Gant and his two older sons grinned sheepishly in unaccustomed evening dress, the Pentlands, faithful in their attendance at weddings and funerals, sent gifts and came. Will and Pett gave a heavy set of carving steels.",1
554,"I hope you always have something to use them on,"" said Will, flensing his hand, and winking at Joe Gambell. Eugene remembered weeks of frantic preparation, dress fittings, rehearsals, the hysteria of Daisy, who stared at her nails until they went blue, and the final splendor of the last two days--the arriving gifts, the house, unnaturally cheerful with rich carpets and flowers, the perilous moment when their lives joined, the big packed dining-room, the droning interminable Scotch voice of the Presbyterian minister, the mounting triumph of the music when the grocery clerk got his bride. Later, the confusion, the greetings, the hysteria of the women. Daisy sobbing uncontrollably in the arms of a distant cousin, Beth Pentland, who had come up with her hearty red husband, the owner of a chain of small groceries in a South Carolina town, bringing gifts and a giant watermelon, and whose own grief was enhanced by the discovery, after the wedding, that the dress she had worked on weeks in advance she had put on, in her frenzy, wrong side out.",1
555,"Thus Daisy passed more or less definitely out of Eugene's life, although he was to see her briefly on visits, but with decreasing frequency, in the years that followed. The grocery clerk was making the one daring gesture of his life: he was breaking away from the cotton town, in which all the years of his life had been passed, and from the long lazy hours of grocery clerks, the languorous gossip of lank cotton farmers and townsmen, to which he had been used. He had found employment as a commercial traveller for a food products company: his headquarters was to be in Augusta, Georgia, but he was to travel into the far South.",1
556,"This rooting up of his life, this adventure into new lands, the effort to improve his fortune and his state, was his wedding gift to his wife--a bold one, but imperilled already by distrust, fear, and his peasant suspicion of new scenes, new faces, new departures, of any life that differed from that of his village. There's no place like Henderson,"" said he, with complacent and annoying fidelity, referring to that haven of enervation, red clay, ignorance, slander, and superstition, in whose effluent rays he had been reared. But he went to Augusta, and began his new life with Daisy in a lodging house. She was twenty-one, a slender, blushing girl who played the piano beautifully, accurately, academically, with a rippling touch, and no imagination. Eugene could never remember her very well.",1
557,"In the early autumn after her marriage, Gant made the journey to Augusta, taking Eugene with him. The inner excitement of both was intense; the hot wait at the sleepy junction of Spartanburg, the ride in the dilapidated day coaches of the branch line that ran to Augusta, the hot baked autumnal land, rolling piedmont and pine woods, every detail of the landscape they drank in with thirsty adventurous eyes. Gant's roving spirit was parched for lack of travel: for Eugene, Saint Louis was a faint unreality, but there burned in him a vision of the opulent South, stranger even than his passionate winter nostalgia for the snow-bound North, which the drifted but short-lived snows in Altamont, the seizure of the unaccustomed moment for sledding and skating on the steep hills awakened in him with a Northern desire, a desire for the dark, the storm, the winds that roar across the earth and the triumphant comfort of warm walls which only a Southerner perhaps can know.",1
558,"And he saw the town of Augusta first not in the drab hues of reality, but as one who bursts a window into the faery pageant of the world, as one who has lived in prison, and finds life and the earth in rosy dawn, as one who has lived in all the fabulous imagery of books, and finds in a journey only an extension and verification of it--so did he see Augusta, with the fresh washed eyes of a child, with glory, with enchantment. They were gone two weeks. He remembered chiefly the brown stains of the recent flood, which had flowed through the town and inundated its lower floors, the broad main street, the odorous and gleaming drugstore, scented to him with all the spices of his fancy, the hills and fields of Aiken, in South Carolina, where he sought vainly for John D. Rockefeller, a legendary prince who, he heard, went there for sport, marvelling that two States could join imperceptibly, without visible markings, and the cotton gin where he saw the great press mash the huge raw bales cleanly into tight bundles half their former size.",1
559,"Once, some children on the street had taunted him because of his long hair, and he had fallen into a cursing fury; once, in a rage at some quarrel with his sister, he set off on a world adventure, walking furiously for hours down a country road by the river and cotton fields, captured finally by Gant who sought for him in a hired rig. They went to the theatre: it was one of the first plays he had seen. The play was a biblical one, founded on the story of Saul and Jonathan, and he whispered to Gant from scene to scene the trend of coming events--a precocity which pleased his father mightily, and to which he referred for months.",1
560,"Just before they came home, Joe Gambell, in a fit of concocted petulance, resigned his position, and announced that he was returning to Henderson. His adventure had lasted three months. 13",1
561,"In the years that followed, up to his eleventh or twelfth year when he could no longer travel on half fares, Eugene voyaged year by year into the rich mysterious South. Eliza, who, during her first winter at Dixieland, had been stricken by severe attacks of rheumatism, induced partly by kidney trouble, which caused her flesh to swell puffily, and which was diagnosed by the doctor as Blight's Disease, began to make extensive, although economical, voyages into Florida and Arkansas in search of health and, rather vaguely, in search of wealth. She always spoke hopefully of the possibility of opening a boarding-house at some tropical winter resort, during the seasons there and in Altamont. In winter now, she rented Dixieland for a few months, sometimes for a year, although she really had no intention of allowing the place to slip through her fingers during the profitable summer season: usually, she let the place go, more or less deliberately, to some unscrupulous adventuress of lodging houses, good for a month's or two months' rent, but incapable of the sustained effort that would support it for a longer time. On her return from her journey, with rents in arrears, or with some other violation of the contract as an entering wedge, Eliza would surge triumphantly into battle, making a forced entrance with police, plain-clothes men, warrants, summonses, writs, injunctions, and all the other artillery of legal warfare, possessing herself forcibly, and with vindictive pleasure, of her property.",1
562,"But she turned always into the South--the North for her was a land which she threatened often to explore, but which secretly she held in suspicion: there was in her no deep animosity because of an old war, her feeling was rather one of fear, distrust, alienation--the ""Yankee"" to whom she humorously referred was foreign and remote. So, she turned always into the South, the South that burned like Dark Helen in Eugene's blood, and she always took him with her. They still slept together.",1
563,"His feeling for the South was not so much historic as it was of the core and desire of dark romanticism--that unlimited and inexplicable drunkenness, the magnetism of some men's blood that takes them into the heart of the heat, and beyond that, into the polar and emerald cold of the South as swiftly as it took the heart of that incomparable romanticist who wrote The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, beyond which there is nothing. And this desire of his was unquestionably enhanced by all he had read and visioned, by the romantic halo that his school history cast over the section, by the whole fantastic distortion of that period where people were said to live in ""mansions,"" and slavery was a benevolent institution, conducted to a constant banjo-strumming, the strewn largesses of the colonel and the shuffle-dance of his happy dependents, where all women were pure, gentle, and beautiful, all men chivalrous and brave, and the Rebel horde a company of swagger, death-mocking cavaliers. Years later, when he could no longer think of the barren spiritual wilderness, the hostile and murderous intrenchment against all new life--when their cheap mythology, their legend of the charm of their manner, the aristocratic culture of their lives, the quaint sweetness of their drawl, made him writhe--when he could think of no return to their life and its swarming superstition without weariness and horror, so great was his fear of the legend, his fear of their antagonism, that he still pretended the most fanatic devotion to them, excusing his Northern residence on grounds of necessity rather than desire.",1
564,"Finally, it occurred to him that these people had given him nothing, that neither their love not their hatred could injure him, that he owed them nothing, and he determined that he would say so, and repay their insolence with a curse. And he did. So did his boundaries stretch into enchantment--into fabulous and solitary wonder broken only by Eliza's stingy practicality, by her lack of magnificence in a magnificent world, by the meals of sweet rolls and milk and butter in an untidy room, by the shoe boxes of luncheon carried on the trains and opened in the diner, after a lengthy inspection of the menu had led to the ordering of coffee, by the interminable quarrels over price and charges in almost every place they went, by her commands to him to ""scrooch up"" when the conductor came through for the tickets, for he was a tall lank boy, and his half-fare age might be called to question.",1
565,"She took him to Florida in the late winter following Gant's return from Augusta: they went to Tampa first, and, a few days later, to Saint Petersburg. He plowed through the loose deep sand of the streets, fished interminably with jolly old men at the end of the long pier, devoured a chest full of dime novels that he found in the rooms she had rented in a private house. They left abruptly, after a terrific quarrel with the old Cracker who ran the place, who thought himself tricked out of the best part of a season's rent, and hurried off to South Carolina on receipt of a hysterical message from Daisy which bade her mother to ""come at once. They arrived in the dingy little town, which was sticky with wet clay, and clammy with rain, in late March: Daisy's first child, a boy, had been born the day before. Eliza, annoyed at what she considered the useless disruption of her holiday, quarrelled bitterly with her daughter a day or two after her arrival, and departed for Altamont with the declaration, which Daisy ironically applauded, that she would never return again. But she did.",1
566,"The following winter she went to New Orleans at the season of the Mardi Gras, taking her youngest with her. Eugene remembered the huge cisterns for rain-water, in the back yard of Aunt Mary's house, the heavy window-rattling thunder of Mary's snores at night, and the vast pageantry of carnival on Canal Street: the storied floats, the smiling beauties, the marching troops, the masks grotesque and fantastical. And once more he saw ships at anchor at the foot of Canal Street; and their tall keels looked over on the street behind the sea walls; and in the cemeteries all the graves were raised above the ground ""because,"" said Oll, Gant's nephew, ""the water rots 'em.",1
567,"And he remembered the smells of the French market, the heavy fragrance of the coffee he drank there, and the foreign Sunday gaiety of the city's life--the theatres open, the sound of hammer and saw, the gay festivity of crowds. He visited the Boyles, old guests at Dixieland, who lived in the old French quarter, sleeping at night with Frank Boyle in a vast dark room lighted dimly with tapers: they had as cook an ancient negress who spoke only French, and who returned from the Market early in the morning bearing a huge basket loaded with vegetables, tropical fruits, fowls, meats. She cooked strange delicious food that he had never tasted before-- heavy gumbo, garnished steaks, sauced fowls.",1
568,"And he looked upon the huge yellow snake of the river, dreaming of its distant shores, the myriad estuaries lush with tropical growth that fed it, all the romantic life of plantation and canefields that fringed it, of moonlight, of dancing darkies on the levee, of slow lights on the gilded river boat, and the perfumed flesh of black-haired women, musical wraiths below the phantom drooping trees. They had but shortly returned from Mardi Gras when, one howling night in winter, as he lay asleep at Gant's, the house was wakened by his father's terrible cries. Gant had been drinking heavily, day after fearful day. Eugene had been sent in the afternoons to his shop to fetch him home, and at sundown, with Jannadeau's aid, had brought him, behind the negro's spavined horse, roaring drunk to his house. There followed the usual routine of soup-feeding, undressing, and holding him in check until Doctor McGuire arrived, thrust his needle deeply into Gant's stringy arm, left sleeping- powders, and departed. The girl was exhausted: Gant himself had ravaged his strength, and had been brought down by two or three painful attacks of rheumatism.",1
569,"Now, he awoke in the dark, possessed by his terror and agony, for the whole right side of his body was paralyzed by such pain as he did not know existed. He cursed and supplicated God alternately in his pain and terror. For days doctor and nurse strove with him, hoping that the leaping inflammation would not strike at his heart. He was gnarled, twisted, and bent with a savage attack of inflammatory rheumatism. As soon as he had recovered sufficiently to travel, he departed, under Helen's care, for Hot Springs. Almost savagely, she drove all other assistance from him, devoting every minute of the day to his care: they were gone six weeks-- occasionally post-cards and letters describing a life of hotels, mineral baths, sickness and lameness, and the sport of the blooded rich, came to add new colors to Eugene's horizon: when they returned Gant was able again to walk, the rheumatism had been boiled from his limbs, but his right hand, gnarled and stiff, was permanently crippled. He was never again able to close it, and there was something strangely chastened in his manner, a gleam of awe and terror in his eyes.",1
570,"But the union between Gant and his daughter was finally consummated. Before Gant lay, half-presaged, a road of pain and terror which led on to death, but as his great strength dwindled, palsied, broke along that road, she went with him inch by inch, welding beyond life, beyond death, beyond memory, the bond that linked them. I'd have died if it hadn't been for that girl,"" he said over and over. She saved my life. I couldn't get along without her. And he boasted again and again of her devotion and loyalty, of the expenses of his journey, of the hotels, the wealth, the life they both had seen.",1
571,"And, as the legend of Helen's goodness and devotion grew, and his dependence upon her got further advertisement, Eliza pursed her lips more and more thoughtfully, wept sometimes into the spitting grease of a pan, smiled, beneath her wide red nose, a smile tremulous, bitter, terribly hurt. I'll show them,"" she wept. I'll show them. And she rubbed thoughtfully at a red itching patch that had appeared during the year upon the back of her left hand.",1
572,"She went to Hot Springs in the winter that followed. They stopped at Memphis for a day or two: Steve was at work there in a paint store; he slipped quickly in and out of saloons, as he took Eugene about the city, leaving the boy outside for a moment while he went ""in here to see a fellow""--a ""fellow"" who always sent him forth, Eugene thought, with an added impetuosity to his swagger. Dizzily they crossed the river: at night he saw the small bleared shacks of Arkansas set in malarial fields.",1
573,"Eliza sent him to one of the public schools of Hot Springs: he plunged heavily into the bewildering new world--performed brilliantly, and won the affection of the young woman who taught him, but paid the penalty of the stranger to all the hostile and banded little creatures of the class. Before his first month was out, he had paid desperately for his ignorance of their customs. Eliza boiled herself out at the baths daily; sometimes, he went along with her, leaving her with a sensation of drunken independence, while he went into the men's quarters, stripping himself in a cool room, entering thence a hot one lined with couches, shutting himself in a steam-closet where he felt himself momentarily dwindling into the raining puddle of sweat at his feet, to emerge presently on trembling legs and to be rolled and kneaded about magnificently in a huge tub by a powerful grinning negro. Later, languorous, but with a feeling of deep purification, he lay out on one of the couches, victoriously his own man in a man's world. They talked from couch to couch, or walked pot-belliedly about, sashed coyly with bath towels--malarial Southerners with malarial drawls, paunch-eyed alcoholics, purple-skinned gamblers, and broken down prize-fighters. He liked the smell of steam and of the sweaty men.",1
574,"Eliza sent him out on the streets at once with The Saturday Evening Post. It won't hurt you to do a little light work after school,"" said she. And as he trudged off with his sack slung from his neck, she would call after him:  ""Spruce up, boy!  Spruce up!",1
575,"Throw your shoulders back. Make folks think you're somebody. And she gave him a pocketful of printed cards, which bore this inscription:                         SPEND YOUR SUMMERS AT                            DIXIELAND                       In Beautiful Altamont,                       America's Switzerland.",1
576,"Rates Reasonable--Both Transient and Tourist. Apply Eliza E. Gant, Prop. You've got to help me drum up some trade, if we're to live, boy,"" she said again, with the lip-pursing, mouth-tremulous jocularity that was coming to wound him so deeply, because he felt it was only an obvious mask for a more obvious insincerity.",1
577,"He writhed as he saw himself finally a toughened pachyderm in Eliza's world--sprucing up confidently, throwing his shoulders back proudly, making people ""think he was somebody"" as he cordially acknowledged an introduction by producing a card setting forth the joys of life in Altamont and at Dixieland, and seized every opening in social relations for the purpose of ""drumming up trade. He hated the jargon of the profession, which she had picked up somewhere long before, and which she used constantly with such satisfaction--smacking her lips as she spoke of ""transients,"" or of ""drumming up trade. In him, as in Gant, there was a silent horror of selling for money the bread of one's table, the shelter of one's walls, to the guest, the stranger, the unknown friend from out the world; to the sick, the weary, the lonely, the broken, the knave, the harlot, and the fool.",1
578,"Thus, lost in the remote Ozarks, he wandered up Central Avenue, fringed on both sides by the swift-sloping hills, for him, by the borders of enchantment, the immediate portals of a land of timeless and never-ending faery. He drank endlessly the water that came smoking from the earth, hoping somehow to wash himself clean from all pollution, beginning his everlasting fantasy of the miraculous spring, or the bath, neck-high, of curative mud, which would draw out of a man's veins each drop of corrupted blood, dry up in him a cancerous growth, dwindle and absorb a cyst, remove all scorbutic blemishes, scoop and suck and thread away the fibrous slime of all disease, leaving him again with the perfect flesh of an animal. And he gazed for hours into the entrances of the fashionable hotels, staring at the ladies' legs upon the verandas, watching the great ones of the land at their recreations, thinking, with a pang of wonder, that here were the people of Chambers, of Phillips, of all the society novelists, leading their godlike lives in flesh, recording their fiction. He was deeply reverential before the grand manner of these books, particularly before the grand manner of the English books: there people loved, but not as other people, elegantly; their speech was subtle, delicate, exquisite; even in their passions there was no gross lust or strong appetite--they were incapable of the vile thoughts or the meaty desire of common people. As he looked at the comely thighs of the young women on horses, fascinated to see their shapely legs split over the strong good smell of a horse, he wondered if the warm sinuous vibration of the great horse-back excited them, and what their love was like. The preposterous elegance of their manner in the books awed him: he saw seduction consummated in kid gloves, to the accompaniment of subtle repartee. Such thoughts, when he had them, filled him with shame at his own baseness--he imagined for these people a love conducted beyond all the laws of nature, achieving the delight of animals or of common men by the electrical touch of a finger, the flicker of an eye, the intonation of a phrase--exquisitely and incorruptibly.",1
579,"And as they looked at his remote fabulous face, more strange now that its thick fringing curls had been shorn, they bought of him, paying him several times his fee, with the lazy penitence of wasters. Great fish within the restaurant windows swam in glass wells--eels coiled snakily, white-bellied trout veered and sank: he dreamed of strange rich foods within. And sometimes men returned in carriages from the distant river, laden with great fish, and he wondered if he would ever see that river. All that lay around him, near but unexplored, filled him with desire and longing.",1
580,"And later, again, along the sandy coast of Florida, with Eliza, he wandered down the narrow lanes of Saint Augustine, raced along the hard packed beach of Daytona, scoured the green lawns of Palm Beach, before the hotels, for cocoanuts, which Eliza desired as souvenirs, filling a brown tow sack with them and walking, with the bag hung from his shoulders, down the interminable aisles of the Royal Poinciana or the Breakers, target of scorn, and scandal, and amusement from slave and prince; or traversed the spacious palm- cool walks that cut the peninsula, to see, sprawled in the sensual loose sand the ladies' silken legs, the brown lean bodies of the men, the long seaplunges in the unending scroll-work of the emerald and infinite sea, which had beat in his brain from his father's shells, which had played at his mountain heart, but which never, until now, had he seen. Through the spattered sunlight of the palms, in the smooth walks, princess and lord were wheeled: in latticed bar-rooms, droning with the buzzing fans, men drank from glacéd tall glasses. Or again, they came to Jacksonville, lived there for several weeks near Pett and Greeley; he studied under a little crippled man from Harvard, going to lunch with his teacher at a buffet, where the man consumed beer and pretzels. Eliza protested the tuition when she left: the cripple shrugged his shoulders, took what she had to offer. Eugene twisted his neck about, and lifted his foot from the ground.",1
581,"Thus did he see first, he the hill-bound, the sky-girt, of whom the mountains were his masters, the fabulous South. The picture of flashing field, of wood, and hill, stayed in his heart forever: lost in the dark land, he lay the night-long through within his berth, watching the shadowy and phantom South flash by, sleeping at length, and waking suddenly, to see cool lakes in Florida at dawn, standing quietly as if they had waited from eternity for this meeting; or hearing, as the train in the dark hours of morning slid into Savannah, the strange quiet voices of the men upon the platform, the boding faint echoes of the station, or seeing, in pale dawn, the phantom woods, a rutted lane, a cow, a boy, a drab, dull-eyed against a cottage door, glimpsed, at this moment of rushing time, for which all life had been aplot, to flash upon the window and be gone. The commonness of all things in the earth he remembered with a strange familiarity--he dreamed of the quiet roads, the moonlit woodlands, and he thought that some day he would come to them on foot, and find them there unchanged, in all the wonder of recognition. They had existed for him anciently and forever.",1
582,"Eugene was almost twelve years old. PART TWO    14   The plum-tree, black and brittle, rocks stiffly in winter wind. Her million little twigs are frozen in spears of ice. But in the Spring, lithe and heavy, she will bend under her great load of fruit and blossoms. She will grow young again. Red plums will ripen, will be shaken desperately upon the tiny stems. They will fall bursted on the loamy warm wet earth; when the wind blows in the orchard the air will be filled with dropping plums; the night will be filled with the sound of their dropping, and a great tree of birds will sing, burgeoning, blossoming richly, filling the air also with warm-throated plum-dropping bird-notes.",1
583,"The harsh hill-earth has moistly thawed and softened, rich soaking rain falls, fresh-bladed tender grass like soft hair growing sparsely streaks the land. My Brother Ben's face, thought Eugene, is like a piece of slightly yellow ivory; his high white head is knotted fiercely by his old man's scowl; his mouth is like a knife, his smile the flicker of light across a blade. His face is like a blade, and a knife, and a flicker of light: it is delicate and fierce, and scowls beautifully forever, and when he fastens his hard white fingers and his scowling eyes upon a thing he wants to fix, he sniffs with sharp and private concentration through his long pointed nose. Thus women, looking, feel a well of tenderness for his pointed, bumpy, always scowling face: his hair shines like that of a young boy--it is crinkled and crisp as lettuce.",1
584,"Into the April night-and-morning streets goes Ben. The night is brightly pricked with cool and tender stars. The orchard stirs leafily in the short fresh wind. Ben prowls softly out of the sleeping house. His thin bright face is dark within the orchard. There is a smell of nicotine and shoe leather under the young blossoms. His pigeon-toed tan shoes ring musically up the empty streets. Lazily slaps the water in the fountain on the Square; all the firemen are asleep--but Big Bill Merrick, the brave cop, hog- jowled and red, leans swinishly over mince-pie and coffee in Uneeda Lunch. The warm good ink-smell beats in rich waves into the street: a whistling train howls off into the Springtime South.",1
585,By the cool orchards in the dark the paper-carriers go. The copper legs of negresses in their dark dens stir. The creek brawls cleanly.,1
586,"A new one, Number 6, heard boys speak of Foxy:  ""Who's Foxy?"" asked Number 6. Foxy's a bastard, Number 6.  Don't let him catch you. The bastard caught me three times last week.",1
587,"In the Greek's every time. Why can't they let us eat?""  Number 3 thought of Friday morning--he had the Niggertown route. How many--3?""  ""One hundred and sixty-two.""  ""How many Dead Heads you got, son?"" said Mr. Randall cynically.",1
588,"Do you ever try to collect from them?"" he added, thumbing through the book. He takes it out in Poon-Tang,"" said Foxy, grinning, ""A week's subscription free for a dose. What you got to say about it?"" asked Number 3 belligerently.",1
589,"You've been knocking down on them for six years. Jazz 'em all if you like,"" said Randall, ""but get the money. Ben, I want you to go round with him Saturday. Ben laughed silently and cynically into the air:  ""Oh, my God!",1
590,he said. Do you expect me to check up on the little thug? He's been knocking down on you for the last six months. All right!,1
591,"All right!"" said Randall, annoyed. That's what I want you to find out. Oh, for God's sake, Randall,"" said Ben contemptuously, ""he's got niggers on that book who've been dead for five years.",1
592,"That's what you get for keeping every little crook that comes along. If you don't get a move on, 3, I'll give your route to another boy,"" said Randall. Hell, get another boy. I don't care,"" said Number 3, toughly.",1
593,"Oh, for God's sake! Listen to this, won't you?"" said Ben, laughing thinly and nodding to his angel, indicating Number 3 with a scowling jerk of his head. Yes, listen to this, won't you! That's what I said,"" Number 3 answered pugnaciously.",1
594,"All right, little boy. Run on and deliver your papers now, before you get hurt,"" said Ben, turning his scowl quietly upon him and looking at him blackly for a moment. Ah, you little crook,"" he said with profound loathing, ""I have a kid brother who's worth six like you. Spring lay strewn lightly like a fragrant gauzy scarf upon the earth; the night was a cool bowl of lilac darkness, filled with fresh orchard scents.",1
595,"Gant slept heavily, rattling the loose window-sash with deep rasping snores; with short explosive thunders, ripping the lilac night, 36 began to climb Saluda. She bucked helplessly like a goat, her wheels spun furiously on the rails, Tom Cline stared seriously down into the milky boiling creek, and waited. She slipped, spun, held, ploughed slowly up, like a straining mule, into the dark. Content, he leaned far out the cab and looked: the starlight glimmered faintly on the rails. He ate a thick sandwich of cold buttered fried meat, tearing it raggedly and glueily staining it under his big black fingers. There was a smell of dogwood and laurel in the cool slow passage of the world. The cars clanked humpily across the spur; the switchman, bathed murkily in the hot yellow light of his perilous bank-edged hut, stood sullen at the switch.",1
596,"Arms spread upon his cab-sill, chewing thoughtfully, Tom, goggle- eyed, looked carefully down at him. They had never spoken. Then in silence he turned and took the milk-bottle, half full of cold coffee, that his fireman offered him. He washed his food down with the large easy gurgling swallows of a bishop.",1
597,"At 18 Valley Street, the red shack-porch, slime-scummed with a greasy salve of yellow negroid mud, quaked rottenly. Number 3's square-folded ink-fresh paper struck flat against the door, falling on its edge stiffly to the porch like a block of light wood. Within, May Corpening stirred nakedly, muttering as if doped and moving her heavy copper legs, in the fetid bed-warmth, with the slow noise of silk.",1
598,"Harry Tugman lit a Camel, drawing the smoke deep into his powerful ink-stained lungs as he watched the press run down. His bare arms were heavy-muscled as his presses. He dropped comfortably into his pliant creaking chair and tilted back, casually scanning the warm pungent sheet. Luxurious smoke steamed slowly from his nostrils. He cast the sheet away.",1
599,"Christ! he said. What a makeup!""  Ben came down stairs, moody, scowling, and humped over toward the ice-box.",1
600,"For God's sake, Mac,"" he called out irritably to the Make-up Man, as he scowled under the lifted lid, ""don't you ever keep anything except root-beer and sour milk?""  ""What do you want, for Christ's sake?""  ""I'd like to get a Coca-Cola once in a while. You know,"" he said bitingly, ""Old Man Candler down in Atlanta is still making it. Harry Tugman cast his cigarette away.",1
601,"They haven't got the news up here yet, Ben,"" said he. You'll have to wait till the excitement over Lee's surrender has died down. Come on,"" he said abruptly, getting up, ""let's go over to the Greasy Spoon. He thrust his big head down into the deep well of the sink, letting the lukewarm water sluice refreshingly over his broad neck and blue-white sallow night-time face, strong, tough, and humorous.",1
602,"He soaped his hands with thick slathering suds, his muscles twisting slowly like big snakes. He sang in his powerful quartette baritone:        ""Beware!  Beware! Beware! Many brave hearts lie asleep in the deep,       So beware! Bee-WARE!""   Comfortably they rested in the warm completed exhaustion of the quiet press-room: upstairs the offices, bathed in green-yellow light, sprawled like men relaxed after work.",1
603,The boys had gone to their routes. The place seemed to breathe slowly and wearily. The dawn-sweet air washed coolly over their faces. The sky was faintly pearled at the horizon.,1
604,"Strangely, in sharp broken fragments, life awoke in the lilac darkness. Clop-clopping slowly on the ringing street, Number Six, Mrs. Goulderbilt's powerful brown mare, drew inevitably on the bottle-clinking cream-yellow wagon, racked to the top with creamy extra-heavy high-priced milk. The driver was a fresh-skinned young countryman, richly odorous with the smell of fresh sweat and milk. Eight miles, through the starlit dewy fields and forests of Biltburn, under the high brick English lodgegate, they had come into the town.",1
605,"At the Pisgah Hotel, opposite the station, the last door clicked softly; the stealthy footfalls of the night ceased; Miss Bernice Redmond gave the negro porter eight one-dollar bills and went definitely to bed with the request that she be not disturbed until one o'clock; a shifting engine slatted noisily about in the yard; past the Biltburn crossing Tom Cline whistled with even, mournful respirations. By this time Number 3 had delivered 142 of his papers; he had only to ascend the rickety wooden stairs of the Eagle Crescent bank to finish the eight houses of the Crescent. He looked anxiously across the hill-and-dale-sprawled negro settlement to the eastern rim: behind Birdseye Gap the sky was pearl-gray--the stars looked drowned. Not much time left, he thought. He had a blond meaty face, pale-colored and covered thickly with young blond hair. His jaw was long and fleshy: it sloped backward. He ran his tongue along his full cracked underlip.",1
606,"A 1910 model, four-cylinder, seven-passenger Hudson, with mounting steady roar, shot drunkenly out from the station curbing, lurched into the level negro-sleeping stretch of South End Avenue, where the firemen had their tournaments, and zipped townward doing almost fifty. The station quietly stirred in its sleep: there were faint reverberating noises under the empty sheds; brisk hammer-taps upon car wheels, metallic heel-clicks in the tiled waiting-room. Sleepily a negress slopped water on the tiles, with languid sullen movement pushing a gray sopping rag around the floor.",1
607,"It was now five-thirty. Ben had gone out of the house into the orchard at three twenty-five. In another forty minutes Gant would waken, dress, and build the morning fires.",1
608,"Ben,"" said Harry Tugman, as they walked out of the relaxed office, ""if Jimmy Dean comes messing around my press-room again they can get some one else to print their lousy sheet. What the hell! I can get a job on the Atlanta Constitution whenever I want it. Did he come down to-night?"" asked Ben.  ""Yes,"" said Harry Tugman, ""and he got out again.",1
609,"I told him to take his little tail upstairs. Oh, for God's sake!"" said Ben. What did he say?""  ""He said, 'I'M the editor!",1
610,"I'm the editor of this paper!' 'I don't give a good goddam,' I said, 'if you're the President's snotrag. If you want any paper to-day keep out of the pressroom.' And believe me, he went!",1
611,"In cool blue-pearl darkness they rounded the end of the Post Office and cut diagonally across the street to Uneeda Lunch No. 3. It was a small beanery, twelve feet wide, wedged in between an optician's and a Greek shoe parlor. Within, Dr. Hugh McGuire sat on a stool patiently impaling kidney beans, one at a time, upon the prongs of his fork. A strong odor of corn whisky soaked the air about him. His thick skilful butcher's hands, hairy on the backs, gripped the fork numbly. His heavy-jowled face was blotted by large brown patches. He turned round and stared owlishly as Ben entered, fixing the wavering glare of his bulbous red eyes finally upon him.",1
612,"Hello, son,"" he said in his barking kindly voice, ""what can I do for you?""  ""Oh, for God's sake,"" said Ben laughing contemptuously, and jerking his head toward Tugman. Listen to this, won't you?""  They sat down at the lower end. At this moment, Horse Hines, the undertaker, entered, producing, although he was not a thin man, the effect of a skeleton clad in a black frock coat. His long lantern mouth split horsily in a professional smile displaying big horse teeth in his white heavily starched face.",1
613,"Gentlemen, gentlemen,"" he said for no apparent reason, rubbing his lean hands briskly as if it was cold. His palm-flesh rattled together like old bones.  Coker, the Lung Shark, who had not ceased to regard McGuire's bean- hunt with sardonic interest, now took the long cigar out of his devil's head and held it between his stained fingers as he tapped his companion. Let's get out,"" he grinned quietly, nodding toward Horse Hines. It will look bad if we're seen together here. Good morning, Ben,"" said Horse Hines, sitting down below him.",1
614,"Are all the folks well?"" he added, softly.  Sideways Ben looked at him scowling, then jerked his head back to the counterman, with a fast bitter flicker of his lips. Doctor,"" said Harry Tugman with servile medicine-man respect, ""what do you charge to operate? Operate what?",1
615,"McGuire barked presently, having pronged a kidney bean. Why--appendicitis,"" said Harry Tugman, for it was all he could think of. Three hundred dollars when we go into the belly,"" said McGuire. He coughed chokingly to the side.",1
616,"You're drowning in your own secretions,"" said Coker with his yellow grin. Like Old Lady Sladen. My God!"" said Harry Tugman, thinking jealously of lost news.",1
617,"When did she go?""  ""To-night,"" said Coker. God, I'm sorry to hear that,"" said Harry Tugman, greatly relieved. I've just finished laying the old lady out,"" said Horse Hines gently. A bundle of skin and bones. He sighed regretfully, and for a moment his boiled eye moistened.",1
618,"Ben turned his scowling head around with an expression of nausea. Joe,"" said Horse Hines with merry professionalism, ""give me a mug of that embalming fluid. He thrust his horsehead indicatively at the coffee urn.",1
619,"Oh, for God's sake,"" Ben muttered in terms of loathing. Do you ever wash your damned hands before you come in here?"" he burst out irritably. Ben was twenty. Men did not think of his age.",1
620,"Would you like some cold pork, son?"" said Coker, with his yellow malicious grin. Ben made a retching noise in his throat, and put his hand upon his stomach. What's the matter, Ben?""  Harry Tugman laughed heavily and struck him on the back.",1
621,"Ben got off the stool, took his coffee mug and the piece of tanned mince pie he had ordered, and moved to the other side of Harry Tugman. Every one laughed. Then he jerked his head toward McGuire with a quick frown.",1
622,"By God, Tug,"" he said. They've got us cornered. Listen to him,"" said McGuire to Coker.",1
623,"A chip off the old block, isn't he? I brought that boy into the world, saw him through typhoid, got the old man over seven hundred drunks, and I've been called eighteen different kinds of son of a bitch for my pains ever since. But let one of 'em get a belly ache,"" he added proudly, ""and you'll see how quick they come running to me. Isn't that right, Ben?"" he said, turning to him.",1
624,"Oh, listen to this!"" said Ben, laughing irritably and burying his peaked face in his coffee mug. His bitter savor filled the place with life, with tenderness, with beauty. They looked on him with drunken, kindly eyes--at his gray scornful face and the lonely demon flicker of his smile.",1
625,"And I tell you something else,"" said McGuire, ponderously wheeling around on Coker, ""if one of them's got to be cut open, see who gets the job. What about it, Ben?"" he asked. By God, if you ever cut me open, McGuire,"" said Ben, ""I'm going to be damned sure you can walk straight before you do. Come on, Hugh,"" said Coker, prodding McGuire under his shoulder. ""Stop chasing those beans around the plate.",1
626,"Crawl off or fall off that damned stool--I don't care which. McGuire, drunkenly lost in revery, stared witlessly down at his bean plate and sighed. Come on, you damned fool,"" said Coker, getting up, ""you've got to operate in forty-five minutes. Oh, for God's sake,"" said Ben, lifting his face from the stained mug, ""who's the victim?",1
627,"I'll send flowers. . . . all of us sooner or later,"" McGuire mumbled puffily through his puff-lips. Rich and poor alike. Here to-day and gone to- morrow. Doesn't matter . . . doesn't matter at all. In heaven's name,"" Ben burst out irritably to Coker.",1
628,"Are you going to let him operate like that? Why don't you shoot them instead? Coker plucked the cigar from his long malarial grinning face:  ""Why, he's just getting hot, son,"" said he.",1
629,"Nacreous pearl light swam faintly about the hem of the lilac darkness; the edges of light and darkness were stitched upon the hills. Morning moved like a pearl-gray tide across the fields and up the hill-flanks, flowing rapidly down into the soluble dark. At the curb now, young Dr. Jefferson Spaugh brought his Buick roadster to a halt, and got out, foppishly drawing off his gloves and flicking the silk lapels of his dinner jacket. His face, whisky-red, was highboned and handsome; his mouth was straightlipped, cruel, and sensual. An inherited aura of mountain-cornfield sweat hung scentlessly but telepathically about him; he was a smartened-up mountaineer with country-club and University of Pennsylvania glossings. Four years in Philly change a man.",1
630,"Thrusting his gloves carelessly into his coat, he entered. McGuire slid bearishly off his stool and gazed him into focus. Then he made beckoning round-arm gestures with his fat hands.",1
631,"Look at it, will you,"" he said. Does any one know what it is?""  ""It's Percy,"" said Coker. You know Percy Van der Gould, don't you?""  ""I've been dancing all night at the Hilliards,"" said Spaugh elegantly.",1
632,"Damn! These new patent-leather pumps have ruined my feet. He sat upon a stool, and elegantly displayed his large country feet, indecently broad and angular in the shoes.",1
633,"What's he been doing?"" said McGuire doubtfully, turning to Coker for enlightenment. He's been dancing all night at the Hilliards,"" said Coker in a mincing voice. McGuire shielded his bloated face coyly with his hand.",1
634,"O crush me! he said, ""I'm a grape! Dancing at the Hilliards, were you, you damned Mountain Grill. You've been on a Poon-Tang Picnic in Niggertown. You can't load that bunk on us. Bull-lunged, their laughter filled the nacreous dawn.",1
635,"Patent-leather pumps!"" said McGuire. Hurt his feet. By God, Coker, the first time he came to town ten years ago he'd never been curried above the knees. They had to throw him down to put shoes on him. Ben laughed thinly to the Angel.",1
636,"A couple of slices of buttered toast, if you please, not too brown,"" said Spaugh delicately to the counterman. A mess of hog chitlings and sorghum, you mean, you bastard. You were brought up on salt pork and cornbread. We're getting too low and coarse for him, Hugh,"" said Coker.",1
637,"Now that he's got drunk with some of the best families, he's in great demand socially. He's so highly thought of that he's become the official midwife to all pregnant virgins. Yes,"" said McGuire, ""he's their friend.",1
638,"He helps them out. He not only helps them out, he helps them in again. What's wrong with that?"" said Spaugh.",1
639,"We ought to keep it in the family, oughtn't we?""  Their laughter howled out into the tender dawn. This conversation is getting too rough for me,"" said Horse Hines banteringly as he got off his stool. Shake hands with Coker before you go, Horse,"" said McGuire. He's the best friend you've ever had. You ought to give him royalties. The light that filled the world now was soft and otherworldly like the light that fills the sea-floors of Catalina where the great fish swim.",1
640,"Flatfootedly, with kidney-aching back, Patrolman Leslie Roberts all unbuttoned slouched through the submarine pearl light and paused, gently agitating his club behind him, as he turned his hollow liverish face toward the open door. Here's your patient,"" said Coker softly, ""the Constipated Cop.""  Aloud, with great cordiality, they all said:  ""How are you, Les?""  ""Oh, tolable, tolable,"" said the policeman mournfully. As draggled as his mustaches, he passed on, hocking into the gutter a slimy gob of phlegm.",1
641,"Well, good morning, gentlemen,"" said Horse Hines, making to go. Remember what I told you, Horse.  Be good to Coker, your best friend. McGuire jerked a thumb toward Coker.",1
642,"Beneath his thin joviality Horse Hines was hurt. I do remember,"" said the undertaker gravely. We are both members of honorable professions: in the hour of death when the storm- tossed ship puts into its haven of rest, we are the trustees of the Almighty. Why, Horse!"" Coker exclaimed, ""this is eloquence!""  ""The sacred rites of closing the eyes, of composing the limbs, and of preparing for burial the lifeless repository of the departed soul is our holy mission; it is for us, the living, to pour balm upon the broken heart of Grief, to soothe the widow's ache, to brush away the orphan's tears; it is for us, the living, to highly resolve that--""  ""--Government of the people, for the people, and by the people,"" said Hugh McGuire.",1
643,"Yes, Horse,"" said Coker, ""you are right. I'm touched. And what's more, we do it all for nothing. At least,"" he added virtuously, ""I never charge for soothing the widow's ache. What about embalming the broken heart of Grief?"" asked McGuire.",1
644,"I said BALM,"" Horse Hines remarked coldly. Stay, Horse,"" said Harry Tugman, who had listened with great interest, ""didn't you make a speech with all that in it last summer at the Undertakers' Convention?""  ""What's true then is true now,"" said Horse Hines bitterly, as he left the place. Jesus!"" said Harry Tugman, ""we've got him good and sore. I thought I'd bust a gut, doc, when you pulled that one about embalming the broken heart of Grief.",1
645,"At this moment Dr. Ravenel brought his Hudson to a halt across the street before the Post Office, and walked over rapidly, drawing his gauntlets off. He was bareheaded; his silver aristocratic hair was thinly rumpled; his surgical gray eyes probed restlessly below the thick lenses of his spectacles. He had a famous, calm, deeply concerned face, shaven, ashen, lean, lit gravely now and then by humor.",1

648,"He looked at his watch. I believe you have a little engagement at the Ravenel hospital in about half an hour. Is that right?""  ""By God, Dick, you're always right,"" McGuire yelled enthusiastically.",1
649,"What'd you tell 'em up there, boy?""  ""I told them,"" said Dick Ravenel, whose affection was like a flower that grew behind a wall, ""that the best surgeon in America when he was sober was a lousy bum named Hugh McGuire who was always drunk. Now wait, wait. Hold on a minute! said McGuire, holding up his thick hand. I protest, Dick. You meant well, son, but you got that mixed up. You mean the best surgeon in America when he's not sober. Did you read one of your papers?"" said Coker.",1
650,"Yes,"" said Dick Ravenel. I read one on carcinoma of the liver. How about one on pyorrhea of the toe-nails?"" said McGuire.",1
651,"Did you read that one?""  Harry Tugman laughed heavily, not wholly knowing why. McGuire belched into the silence loudly and was witlessly adrift for a moment. Literature, literature, Dick,"" he returned portentously. It's been the ruin of many a good surgeon. You read too much, Dick. Yon Cassius hath a lean and hungry look. You know too much. The letter killeth the spirit, you know. Me--Dick, did you ever know me to take anything out that I didn't put back? Anyway, don't I always leave 'em something to go on with? I'm no scholar, Dick. I've never had your advantages. I'm a self-made butcher. I'm a carpenter, Dick. I'm an interior decorator. I'm a mechanic, a plumber, an electrician, a butcher, a tailor, a jeweller. I'm a jewel, a gem, a diamond in the rough, Dick. I'm a practical man. I take out their works, spit upon them, trim off the dirty edges, and send them on their way again. I economize, Dick; I throw away everything I can't use, and use everything I throw away. Who made the Pope a tailbone from his knuckle? Who made the dog howl? Aha-- that's why the governor looks so young. We are filled up with useless machinery, Dick.  Efficiency, economy, power! Have you a Little Fairy in your Home? You haven't! Then let the Gold Dust Twins do the work! Ask Ben--he knows! O my God!"" laughed Ben thinly, ""listen to that, won't you?""  Two doors below, directly before the Post Office, Pete Mascari rolled upward with corrugated thunder the shutters of his fruit shop.",1
652,"The pearl light fell coolly upon the fruity architecture, on the pyramided masonry of spit-bright wine-saps, the thin sharp yellow of the Florida oranges, the purple Tokays, sawdust-bedded. There was a stale fruity odor from the shop of ripening bananas, crated apples, and the acrid tang of powder; the windows are filled with Roman candles, crossed rockets, pinwheels, squat green Happy Hooligans, and multilating Jack Johnsons, red cannoncrackers, and tiny acrid packets of crackling spattering firecrackers. Light fell a moment on the ashen corpsiness of his face and on the liquid Sicilian poison of his eyes.",1
653,"Don' pincha da grape. Pinch da banan'! A street-car, toy-green with new Spring paint, went squareward.",1
654,"Dick,"" said McGuire more soberly, ""take the job, if you like. Ravenel shook his head. I'll stand by,"" said he. I won't operate. I'm afraid of one like this. It's your job, drunk or sober. Removing a tumor from a woman, ain't you?"" said Coker.",1
655,"No,"" said Dick Ravenel, ""removing a woman from a tumor. Bet you it weighs fifty pounds, if it weighs an ounce,"" said McGuire with sudden professional interest. Dick Ravenel winced ever so slightly. A cool spurt of young wind, clean as a kid, flowed by him. McGuire's meaty shoulders recoiled burlily as if from the cold shock of water. He seemed to waken.",1
656,"I'd like a bath,"" he said to Dick Ravenel, ""and a shave. He rubbed his hand across his blotched hairy face. You can use my room, Hugh, at the hotel,"" said Jeff Spaugh, looking at Ravenel somewhat eagerly.",1
657,"I'll use the hospital,"" he said. You'll just have time,"" said Ravenel. In God's name, let's get a start on,"" he cried impatiently.",1
658,"Did you see Kelly do this one at Hopkins?"" asked McGuire. Yes,"" said Dick Ravenel, ""after a very long prayer. That's to give power to his elbow. The patient died. Damn the prayers!"" said McGuire.",1
659,"They won't do much good to this one. She called me a low-down lickered-up whisky-drinking bastard last night: if she still feels like that she'll get well. These mountain women take a lot of killing,"" said Jeff Spaugh sagely.",1
660,"Do you want to come along? McGuire asked Coker. No, thanks. I'm getting some sleep,"" he answered. The old girl took a hell of a time. I thought she'd never get through dying. They started to go.",1
661,"Ben,"" said McGuire, with a return to his former manner, ""tell the Old Man I'll beat hell out of him if he doesn't give Helen a rest. Is he staying sober?""  ""In heaven's name, McGuire, how should I know? Ben burst out irritably. Do you think that's all I've got to do--watching your licker-heads?""  ""That's a great girl, boy,"" said McGuire sentimentally.",1
662,"One in a million. Hugh, for God's sake, come on,"" cried Dick Ravenel. The four medical men went out into the pearl light. The town emerged from the lilac darkness with a washed renascent cleanliness. All the world seemed as young as Spring. McGuire walked across to Ravenel's car, and sank comfortably with a sense of invigoration into the cool leathers. Jeff Spaugh plunged off violently with a ripping explosion of his engine and a cavalier wave of his hand.",1
663,"Admiringly Harry Tugman's face turned to the slumped burly figure of Hugh McGuire. By God! he boasted, ""I bet he does the damnedest piece of operating you ever heard of. Why, hell,"" said the counterman loyally, ""he ain't worth a damn until he's got a quart of corn licker under his belt.",1
664,"Give him a few drinks and he'll cut off your damned head and put it on again without your knowing it.""  As Jeff Spaugh roared off Harry Tugman said jealously:  ""Look at that bastard. Mr. Vanderbilt. He thinks he's hell, don't he? A big pile of bull. Ben, do you reckon he was really out at the Hilliards to-night? Oh for God's sake,"" said Ben irritably, ""how the hell should I know!",1
665,"What difference does it make? he added furiously. I guess Little Maudie will fill up the column to-morrow with some of her crap,"" said Harry Tugman. 'The Younger Set,' she calls it! Christ! It goes all the way from every little bitch old enough to wear drawers, to Old Man Redmond. If Saul Gudger belongs to the Younger Set, Ben, you and I are still in the third grade. Why, hell, yes,"" he said with an air of conviction to the grinning counterman, ""he was bald as a pig's knuckle when the Spanish American War broke out. The counterman laughed.",1
666,"Foaming with brilliant slapdash improvisation Harry Tugman declaimed:  ""Members of the Younger Set were charmingly entertained last night at a dinner dance given at Snotwood, the beautiful residence of Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Firkins, in honor of their youngest daughter, Gladys, who made her debut this season. Mr. and Mrs. Firkins, accompanied by their daughter, greeted each of the arriving guests at the threshhold in a manner reviving the finest old traditions of Southern aristocracy, while Mrs. Firkins' accomplished sister, Miss Catherine Hipkiss, affectionately known to members of the local younger set as Roaring Kate, supervised the checking of overcoats, evening wraps, jock-straps, and jewelry. Dinner was served promptly at eight o'clock, followed by coffee and Pluto Water at eight forty-five. A delicious nine-course collation had been prepared by Artaxerxes Papadopolos, the well- known confectioner and caterer, and proprietor of the Bijou Café for Ladies and Gents.",1
667,"After first-aid and a thorough medical examination by Dr. Jefferson Reginald Alfonso Spaugh, the popular GIN-ecologist, the guests adjourned to the Ball Room where dance music was provided by Zeke Buckner's Upper Hominy Stringed Quartette, Mr. Buckner himself officiating at the trap drum and tambourine. Among those dancing were the Misses Aline Titsworth, Lena Ginster, Ophelia Legg, Gladys Firkins, Beatrice Slutsky, Mary Whitesides, Helen Shockett, and Lofta Barnes. Also the Messrs.  I. C. Bottom, U. B. Freely, R. U. Reddy, O. I. Lovett, Cummings Strong, Sansom Horney, Preston Updyke, Dows Wicket, Pettigrew Biggs, Otis Goode, and J. Broad Stem. Ben laughed noiselessly, and bent his pointed face into the mug again.",1
668,"Then, he stretched his thin arms out, extending his body sensually upward, and forcing out in a wide yawn the night-time accumulation of weariness, boredom, and disgust. Oh-h-h-h my God!""    Virginal sunlight crept into the street in young moteless shafts. At this moment Gant awoke.",1
669,"He lay quietly on his back for a moment in the pleasant yellow- shaded dusk of the sitting-room, listening to the rippling flutiness of the live piping birdy morning. He yawned cavernously and thrust his right hand scratching into the dense hairthicket of his breast. The fast cackle-cluck of sensual hens. Come and rob us. All through the night for you, master. Rich protesting yielding voices of Jewesses. Do it, don't it. Break an egg in them.",1
670,"Sleepless, straight, alert, the counterpane moulded over his gaunt legs, he listened to the protesting invitations of the hens. From the warm dust, shaking their fat feathered bodies, protesting but satisfied they staggered up. For me. The earth too and the vine. The moist new earth cleaving like cut pork from the plough. Or like water from a ship. The spongy sod spaded cleanly and rolled back like flesh. Or the earth loosened and hoed gently around the roots of the cherry trees. The earth receives my seed. For me the great lettuces. Spongy and full of sap now like a woman. The thick grapevine--in August the heavy clustered grapes-- How there? Like milk from a breast. Or blood through a vein. Fattens and plumps them.",1
671,All through the night the blossoms dropping. Soon now the White Wax. Green apples end of May. Isaacs' June Apple hangs half on my side. Bacon and fried green apples.,1
672,"With sharp whetted hunger he thought of breakfast. He threw the sheet back cleanly, swung in an orbit to a sitting position and put his white somewhat phthisic feet on the floor. Standing up tenderly, he walked over to his leather rocker and put on a pair of clean white-footed socks. Then he pulled his nightgown over his head, looking for a moment in the dresser mirror at his great boned structure, the long stringy muscles of his arms, and his flat- meated hairy chest. His stomach sagged paunchily. He thrust his white flaccid calves quickly through the shrunken legs of a union suit, stretched it out elasticly with a comfortable widening of his shoulders and buttoned it. Then he stepped into his roomy sculpturally heavy trousers and drew on his soft-leathered laceless shoes. Crossing his suspender braces over his shoulders, he strode into the kitchen and had a brisk fire of oil and pine snapping in the range within three minutes. He was stimulated and alive in all the fresh wakefulness of the Spring morning.",1
673,"Through Birdseye Gap, in the dewy richness of Lunn's Cove, Judge Webster Tayloe, the eminent, prosperous, and aristocratic corporation counsel (retired, but occasional consultations), rose in the rich walnut twilight of his bedchamber, noted approvingly, through the black lenses of the glasses that gave his long, subtle, and contemptuous face its final advantage over the rabble, that one of his country bumpkins was coming from the third pasture with a slopping pail of new milk, another was sharpening a scythe in the young glint of the sun, and another, emulating his more intelligent fellow, the horse, was backing a buggy slowly under the carriage shed. Approvingly he watched his young mulatto son come over the lawn with lazy cat-speed, noting with satisfaction the grace and quickness of his movements, the slender barrel strength of his torso, his smallboned resiliency. Also the well-shaped intelligent head, the eager black eyes, the sensitive oval face, and the beautiful coprous olive of the skin. He was very like a better- class Spaniard. Quod potui perfeci. By this fusion, perhaps, men like men.",1
674,"By the river the reed-pipes, the muse's temple, the sacred wood again. Why not? As in this cove. I, too, have lived in Arcady.",1
675,"He took off his glasses for a moment and looked at the ptotic malevolence of his left eye, and the large harlequinesque wart in the cheek below it. The black glasses gave the suggestion that he was half-masked; they added a touch of unsearchable mystery to the subtle, sensual and disquieting intelligence of his face. His negro man appeared at this moment and told him his bath was ready. He drew the long thin nightgown over his freckled Fitzsimmons body and stepped vigorously into tepid water. Then for ten minutes he was sponged, scraped, and kneaded, upon a long table by the powerful plastic hands of the negro. He dressed in fresh laundered underwear and newly pressed clothes of black. He tied a black string carelessly below the wide belt of starched collar and buttoned across his straight long figure a frock coat that reached his knees. He took a cigarette from a box on his table and lighted it.",1
676,"Bouncing tinnily down the coiling road that came through the Gap from the town, a flivver glinted momently through the trees. Two men were in it. His face hardened against it, he watched it go by his gates on the road with a scuffle of dust. Dimly he saw their lewd red mountain faces, and completed the image with sweat and corduroy. And in the town their city cousins. Brick, stucco, the white little eczema of Suburbia. Federated Half-Breeds of the World.",1
677,"Into my Valley next with lawnmowers and front lawns. He ground out the life of the cigarette against an ashtray, and began a rapid window calculation of his horses, asses, kine, swine, and hens; the stored plenitude of his great barn, the heavy fruitage of his fields and orchards. A man came toward the house with a bucket of eggs in one hand and a bucket of butter in the other; each cake was stamped with a sheaf of wheat and wrapped loosely in clean white linen cloths. He smiled grimly: if attacked he could withstand a prolonged siege.",1
678,"At Dixieland, Eliza slept soundly in a small dark room with a window opening on the uncertain light of the back porch. Her chamber was festooned with a pendant wilderness of cord and string; stacks of old newspapers and magazines were piled in the corners; and every shelf was loaded with gummed, labelled, half-filled medicine bottles. There was a smell in the air of mentholatum, Vick's Pneumonia Cure, and sweet glycerine. The negress arrived, coming under the built-up house and climbing lazily the steep tunnel of back steps. She knocked at the door.",1
679,"Who's there! cried Eliza sharply, waking at once, and coming forward to the door. She wore a gray flannel nightgown over a heavy woollen undershirt that Ben had discarded: the pendant string floated gently to and fro as she opened the door, like some strange seamoss floating below the sea. Upstairs, in the small front room with the sleeping-porch, slept Miss Billie Edwards, twenty-four, of Missouri, the daring and masterful liontamer of Johnny L. Jones Combined Shows, then playing in the field on the hill behind the Plum Street School. Next to her, in the large airy room at the corner, Mrs. Marie Pert, forty-one, the wife of an itinerant and usually absent drug salesman, lay deep in the pit of alcoholic slumber. Upon each end of the mantel was a small snapshot in a silver frame--one of her absent daughter, Louise, eighteen, and one of Benjamin Gant, lying on the grass-bank in front of the house, propped on his elbow and wearing a wide straw hat that shaded all his face except his mouth. Also, in other chambers, front and back, Mr. Conway Richards, candy-wheel concessionaire with the Johnny L. Jones Combined Shows, Miss Lily Mangum, twenty-six, trained nurse, Mr. William H. Baskett, fifty-three, of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, cotton grower, banker, and sufferer from malaria, and his wife; in the large room at the head of the stairs Miss Annie Mitchell, nineteen, of Valdosta, Georgia, Miss Thelma Cheshire, twenty-one, of Florence, South Carolina, and Mrs. Rose Levin, twenty-eight, of Chicago, Illinois, all members of the chorus of ""Molasses"" Evans and His Broadway Beauties, booked out of Atlanta, Georgia, by the Piedmont Amusement Agency.",1
680,O G-hirls! The Duke of Gorgonzola and the Count of Limburger are on their way here now. I want all you girls to be nice to them and to show them a good time when they arrive. You BET we will.,1

""We are the girls that have the fun,       We're snappy and happy every one;       We're jolly and gay       And ready to play,       And that is why we say-ee--""    Behind a bill-plastered fence-boarding on upper Valley Street, opposite the Y. M. I. (colored), and in the very heart of the crowded amusement and commercial centre of Altamont's colored population, Moses Andrews, twenty-six, colored, slept the last great sleep of white and black.",1
682,"His pockets, which only the night before had been full of the money Saul Stein, the pawnbroker, had given him in exchange for certain articles which he had taken from the home of Mr. George Rollins, the attorney (as an 18-carat Waltham gold watch with a heavy chain of twined gold, the diamond engagement ring of Mrs. Rollins, three pairs of the finest silk stockings, and two pairs of gentlemen's under-drawers), were now empty, a half-filled bottle of Cloverleaf Bonded Kentucky Rye, with which he had retired behind the boards to slumber, lay unmolested in the flaccid grip of his left hand, and his broad black throat gaped cleanly open from ear to ear, as a result of the skilled razor-work of his hated and hating rival, Jefferson Flack, twenty- eight, who now lay peacefully, unsuspected and unsought, with their mutual mistress, Miss Molly Fiske, in her apartment on east Pine Street. Moses had been murdered in moonlight. A starved cat walked softly along by the boards on Upper Valley: as the courthouse bell boomed out its solid six strokes, eight negro laborers, the bottoms of their overalls stiff with agglutinated cement, tramped by like a single animal, in a wedge, each carrying his lunch in a small lard bucket.",1
683,"Meanwhile, the following events occurred simultaneously throughout the neighborhood. Dr. H. M. McRae, fifty-eight, minister of the First Presbyterian Church, having washed his lean Scotch body, arrayed himself in stiff black and a boiled white shirt, and shaved his spare clean un-aging face, descended from his chamber in his residence on Cumberland Avenue, to his breakfast of oatmeal, dry toast, and boiled milk. His heart was pure, his mind upright, his faith and his life like a clean board scrubbed with sandstone. He prayed in thirty-minute prayers without impertinence for all men and the success of all good ventures. He was a white unwasting flame that shone through love and death; his speech rang out like steel with a steady passion.",1
684,"In Dr. Frank Engel's Sanitarium and Turkish Bath Establishment on Liberty Street, Mr. J. H. Brown, wealthy sportsman and publisher of the Altamont Citizen, sank into dreamless sleep, after five minutes in the steam-closet, ten in the tub, and thirty in the dry-room, where he had submitted to the expert osteopathy of ""Colonel"" Andrews (as Dr. Engel's skilled negro masseur was affectionately known), from the soles of his gouty feet to the veinous silken gloss of his slightly purple face. Across the street, at the corner of Liberty and Federal, and at the foot of Battery Hill, a white-jacketed negro sleepily restacked in boxes the scattered poker-chips that covered the centre table in the upstairs centre room of the Altamont City Club. The guests, just departed, were Mr. Gilbert Woodcock, Mr. Reeves Stikeleather, Mr. Henry Pentland, Jr., Mr. Sidney Newbeck, of Cleveland, Ohio (retired), and the aforementioned Mr. J. H. Brown.",1
685,"And, Jesus, Ben!"" said Harry Tugman, emerging at this moment from Uneeda No. 3. I thought I'd have a hemorrhage when they pulled the Old Man out of the closet. After all the stuff he printed about cleaning up the town, too.""  ""It wouldn't surprise me if Judge Sevier had them raid him,"" said Ben.  ""Why certainly, Ben,"" said Harry Tugman impatiently, ""that's the idea, but Queen Elizabeth was behind it.",1
686,"You don't think there's anything she doesn't hear about, do you? So help me Jesus, you never heard a yap out of him for a week. He was afraid to show his face out of the office. At the Convent School of Saint Catherine's on Saint Clement's Road, Sister Theresa, the Mother Superior, walked softly through the dormitory lifting the window-shade beside each cot, letting the orchard cherry-apple bloom come gently into the long cool glade of roseleaf sleeping girls.",1
687,"Their breath expired gently upon their dewy half-opened mouths, light fell rosily upon the pillowed curve of their arms, their slender young sides, and the crisp pink buds of their breasts. At the other end of the room a fat girl lay squarely on her back, her arms and legs outspread, and snored solidly through blubbering lips. They had yet an hour of sleep.",1
688,"From one of the little white tables between the cots Theresa picked up an opened book incautiously left there the night before, read below her gray mustache with the still inward smile of her great- boned face, its title--The Common Law, by Robert W. Chambers--and gripping a pencil in her broad earthstained hand, scrawled briefly in jagged male letters: Rubbish, Elizabeth--but see for yourself. Then, on her soft powerful tread, she went downstairs, and entered her study, where Sister Louise (French), Sister Mary (History), and Sister Bernice (Ancient Languages) were waiting for the morning consultation. When they had gone, she sat down to her desk and worked for an hour on the manuscript of that book, modestly intended for school children, which has since celebrated her name wherever the noble architecture of prose is valued--the great Biology.",1
689,"Then the gong rang in the dormitory, she heard the high laughter of young maidens, and rising saw, coming from the plum-tree by the wall, a young nun, Sister Agnes, with blossoms in her arms. Below, tree-hidden, in the Biltburn bottom, there was a thunder on the rails, a wailing whistle cry. Beneath the City Hall, in the huge sloping cellar, the market booths were open. The aproned butchers swung their cleavers down on fresh cold joints, slapping the thick chops on heavy sheets of mottled paper, and tossing them, roughly tied, to the waiting negro delivery-boys.",1
690,"The self-respecting negro, J. H. Jackson, stood in his square vegetable-stall, attended by his two grave-faced sons, and his spectacled businesslike daughter. He was surrounded by wide slanting shelves of fruit and vegetables, smelling of the earth and morning--great crinkled lettuces, fat radishes still clotted damply with black loam, quill-stemmed young onions newly wrenched from gardens, late celery, spring potatoes, and the thin rinded citrous fruits of Florida. Above him, Sorrell, the fish and oyster man, drew up from the depths of an enamelled ice-packed can dripping ladlefuls of oysters, pouring them into thick cardboard cartons. Wide-bellied heavy seafish--carp, trout, bass, shad--lay gutted in beds of ice.",1
691,"Mr. Michael Walter Creech, the butcher, having finished his hearty breakfast of calves' liver, eggs and bacon, hot biscuits and coffee, made a sign to one of the waiting row of negro boys. The line sprang forward like hounds; he stopped them with a curse and a lifted cleaver. The fortunate youth who had been chosen then came forward and took the tray, still richly morselled with food and a pot half full of coffee. As he had to depart at this moment on a delivery, he put it down in the sawdust at the end of the bench and spat copiously upon it in order to protect it from his scavenging comrades. Then he wheeled off, full of rich laughter and triumphant malice. Mr. Creech looked at his niggers darkly.",1
692,"The town had so far forgotten Mr. Creech's own African blood (an eighth on his father's side, old Walter Creech, out of Yellow Jenny) that it was about ready to offer him political preferment; but Mr. Creech himself had not forgotten. He glanced bitterly at his brother, Jay, who, happily ignorant of hatred, that fanged poison which may taint even a brother's heart, was enthusiastically cleaving spare-ribs on the huge bole of his own table, singing meanwhile in a rich tenor voice the opening bars of ""The Little Gray Home In The West"":        "". . . there are blue eyes that shine       Just because they meet mine . . . Mr. Creech looked venomously at Jay's yellow jowls, the fat throbbing of his jaundiced throat, the crisp singed whorl of his hair.",1
693,"By God, he thought in his anguish of spirit, he might be taken for a Mexican. Jay's golden voice neared its triumph, breaking with delicate restraint, on the last note, into a high sweet falsetto which he maintained for more than twenty seconds. All of the butchers stopped working, several of them, big strong men with grown-up families dashed a tear out of their eyes.",1
694,"The great audience was held spellbound. Not a soul stirred. Not even a dog or a horse stirred. As the last sweet note melted away in a gossamer tremolo, a silence profound as that of the tombs, nay, of death itself, betokened the highest triumph the artist is destined to know upon this earth. Somewhere in the crowd a woman sobbed and collapsed in a faint. She was immediately carried out by two Boy Scouts who happened to be present, and who administered first aid to her in the rest-room, one of them hastily kindling a crackling fire of pine boughs by striking two flints together, while the other made a tourniquet, and tied several knots in his handkerchief. Then pandemonium broke loose. Women tore the jewels from their fingers, ropes of pearls from their necks, chrysanthemums, hyacinths, tulips and daisies from their expensive corsages, while the fashionably-dressed men in the near-by stalls kept up a constant bombardment of tomatoes, lettuces, new potatoes, beef-tallow, pigs' knuckles, fishheads, clams, loin-chops, and pork-sausages.",1
695,"Among the stalls of the market, the boarding-house keepers of Altamont walked with spying bargain-hunting eyes and inquisitive nose. They were of various sizes and ages, but they were all stamped with the print of haggling determination and a pugnacious closure of the mouth. They pried in among the fish and vegetables, pinching cabbages, weighing onions, exfoliating lettuce-heads. You've got to keep your eye on people or they'll skin you. And if you leave things to a lazy shiftless nigger she'll waste more than she cooks. They looked at one another hardfaced--Mrs. Barrett of the Grosvenor at Mrs. Neville of Glen View; Mrs. Ambler of the Colonial at Miss Mamie Featherstone of Ravencrest; Mrs. Ledbetter of the Belvedere--  ""I hear you're full up, Mrs. Coleman,"" said she inquiringly.",1
696,"O, I'm full up all the time,"" said Mrs. Coleman. My people are all permanents, I don't want to fool with transients,"" she said loftily. Well,"" said Mrs. Ledbetter acidly, ""I could fill my house up at any time with lungers who call themselves something else, but I won't have them. I was saying the other day--""  Mrs. Michalove of Oakwood at Mrs. Jarvis of The Waverly; Mrs. Cowan of Ridgmont at--  The city is splendidly equipped to meet the demands of the great and steadily growing crowd of tourists that fill the Mountain Metropolis during the busy months of June, July, and August.",1
697,"In addition to eight hotels de luxe of the highest quality, there were registered at the Board of Trade in 1911 over 250 private hotels, boarding-houses and sanitariums all catering to the needs of those who come on missions of business, pleasure, or health. Stop their baggage at the station. At this moment Number 3, having finished his route, stepped softly on to the slime-scummed porch of the house on Valley Street, rapped gently at the door, and opened it quietly, groping his way through black miasmic air to the bed in which May Corpening lay. She muttered as if drugged as he touched her, turned toward him, and sleepily awakened, drew him down to her with heavied and sensual caress, yoked under her big coppery arms. Tom Cline clumped greasily up the steps of his residence on Barlett Street, swinging his tin pail; Ben returned to the paper office with Harry Tugman; and Eugene, in the back room on Woodson Street, waking suddenly to Gant's powerful command from the foot of the stairs, turned his face full into a momentary vision of rose-flushed blue sky and tender blossoms that drifted slowly earthward.",1
698,"15   The mountains were his masters. They rimmed in life. They were the cup of reality, beyond growth, beyond struggle and death. They were his absolute unity in the midst of eternal change. Old haunt- eyed faces glimmered in his memory. He thought of Swain's cow, St. Louis, death, himself in the cradle. He was the haunter of himself, trying for a moment to recover what he had been part of. He did not understand change, he did not understand growth. He stared at his framed baby picture in the parlor, and turned away sick with fear and the effort to touch, retain, grasp himself for only a moment.",1
699,"And these bodiless phantoms of his life appeared with terrible precision, with all the mad nearness of a vision. That which was five years gone came within the touch of his hand, and he ceased at that moment to believe in his own existence. He expected some one to wake him; he would hear Gant's great voice below the laden vines, would gaze sleepily from the porch into the rich low moon, and go obediently to bed. But still there would be all that he remembered before that and what if--Cause flowed ceaselessly into cause.",1
700,"He heard the ghostly ticking of his life; his powerful clairvoyance, the wild Scotch gift of Eliza, burned inward back across the phantom years, plucking out of the ghostly shadows a million gleams of light--a little station by the rails at dawn, the road cleft through the pineland seen at twilight, a smoky cabin-light below the trestles, a boy who ran among the bounding calves, a wisp-haired slattern, with snuff-sticked mouth, framed in a door, floury negroes unloading sacks from freight-cars on a shed, the man who drove the Fair Grounds bus at Saint Louis, a cool-lipped lake at dawn. His life coiled back into the brown murk of the past like a twined filament of electric wire; he gave life, a pattern, and movement to these million sensations that Chance, the loss or gain of a moment, the turn of the head, the enormous and aimless impulsion of accident, had thrust into the blazing heat of him. His mind picked out in white living brightness these pinpoints of experience and the ghostliness of all things else became more awful because of them. So many of the sensations that returned to open haunting vistas of fantasy and imagining had been caught from a whirling landscape through the windows of the train.",1
701,"And it was this that awed him--the weird combination of fixity and change, the terrible moment of immobility stamped with eternity in which, passing life at great speed, both the observer and the observed seem frozen in time. There was one moment of timeless suspension when the land did not move, the train did not move, the slattern in the doorway did not move, he did not move. It was as if God had lifted his baton sharply above the endless orchestration of the seas, and the eternal movement had stopped, suspended in the timeless architecture of the absolute. Or like those motion- pictures that describe the movements of a swimmer making a dive, or a horse taking a hedge--movement is petrified suddenly in mid-air, the inexorable completion of an act is arrested. Then, completing its parabola, the suspended body plops down into the pool. Only, these images that burnt in him existed without beginning or ending, without the essential structure of time. Fixed in no-time, the slattern vanished, fixed, without a moment of transition.",1
702,"His sense of unreality came from time and movement, from imagining the woman, when the train had passed, as walking back into the house, lifting a kettle from the hearth embers. Thus life turned shadow, the living lights went ghost again. The boy among the calves. Where later? Where now?  I am, he thought, a part of all that I have touched and that has touched me, which, having for me no existence save that which I gave to it, became other than itself by being mixed with what I then was, and is now still otherwise, having fused with what I now am, which is itself a cumulation of what I have been becoming.",1
703,"Why here? Why there? Why now? Why then?  The fusion of the two strong egotisms, Eliza's inbrooding and Gant's expanding outward, made of him a fanatical zealot in the religion of Chance.",1
704,"Beyond all misuse, waste, pain, tragedy, death, confusion, unswerving necessity was on the rails; not a sparrow fell through the air but that its repercussion acted on his life, and the lonely light that fell upon the viscous and interminable seas at dawn awoke sea-changes washing life to him. The fish swam upward from the depth. The seed of our destruction will blossom in the desert, the alexin of our cure grows by a mountain rock, and our lives are haunted by a Georgia slattern because a London cut-purse went unhung. Through Chance, we are each a ghost to all the others, and our only reality; through Chance, the huge hinge of the world, and a grain of dust; the stone that starts an avalanche, the pebble whose concentric circles widen across the seas.",1
705,"He believed himself thus at the centre of life; he believed the mountains rimmed the heart of the world; he believed that from all the chaos of accident the inevitable event came at the inexorable moment to add to the sum of his life. Against the hidden other flanks of the immutable hills the world washed like a vast and shadowy sea, alive with the great fish of his imagining.  Variety, in this unvisited world, was unending, but order and purpose certain: there would be no wastage in adventure-- courage would be regarded with beauty, talent with success, all merit with its true deserving. There would be peril, there would be toil, there would be struggle. But there would not be confusion and waste. There would not be groping. For collected Fate would fall, on its chosen moment, like a plum. There was no disorder in enchantment.",1
706,"Spring lay abroad through all the garden of this world. Beyond the hills the land bayed out to other hills, to golden cities, to rich meadows, to deep forests, to the sea. Forever and forever.",1
707,"Beyond the hills were the mines of King Solomon, the toy republics of Central America, and little tinkling fountains in a court; beyond, the moonlit roofs of Bagdad, the little grated blinds of Samarkand, the moonlit camels of Bythinia, the Spanish ranch-house of the Triple Z, and J. B. Montgomery and his lovely daughter stepping from their private car upon a western track; and the castle-haunted crags of Graustark; the fortune-yielding casino of Monte Carlo; and the blue eternal Mediterranean, mother of empires. And instant wealth ticked out upon a tape, and the first stage of the Eiffel Tower where the restaurant was, and Frenchmen setting fire to their whiskers, and a farm in Devon, white cream, brown ale, the winter's chimney merriment, and Lorna Doone; and the hanging gardens of Babylon, and supper in the sunset with the queens, and the slow slide of the barge upon the Nile, or the wise rich bodies of Egyptian women couched on moonlit balustrades, and the thunder of the chariots of great kings, and tomb-treasure sought at midnight, and the wine-rich chateau land of France, and calico warm legs in hay. Upon a field in Thrace Queen Helen lay, her lovely body dappled in the sun.",1
708,"Meanwhile, business had been fairly good. Eliza's earning power the first few years at Dixieland had been injured by her illnesses. Now, however, she had recovered, and had paid off the last installment on the house. It was entirely hers. The property at this time was worth perhaps $12,000. In addition she had borrowed $3,500 on a twenty-year $5,000 life insurance policy that had only two years more to run, and had made extensive alterations: she had added a large sleeping-porch upstairs, tacked on two rooms, a bath, and a hallway on one side, and extended a hallway, adding three bedrooms, two baths, and a water-closet, on the other. Downstairs she had widened the veranda, put in a large sun-parlor under the sleeping-porch, knocked out the archway in the dining-room, which she prepared to use as a big bedroom in the slack season, scooped out a small pantry in which the family was to eat, and added a tiny room beside the kitchen for her own occupancy.",1
709,"The construction was after her own plans, and of the cheapest material: it never lost the smell of raw wood, cheap varnish, and flimsy rough plastering, but she had added eight or ten rooms at a cost of only $3,000. The year before she had banked almost $2,000-- her bank account was almost $5,000. In addition, she owned jointly with Gant the shop on the Square, which had thirty feet of frontage, and was valued at $20,000, from which he got $65 a month in rent; $20 from Jannadeau, $25 from the McLean Plumbing Company in the basement, and $20 from the J. N. Gillespie Printing Co., which occupied all of the second story. There were, besides, three good building-lots on Merrion Avenue valued at $2,000 apiece, or at $5,500 for all three; the house on Woodson Street valued at $5,000; 110 acres of wooded mountainside with a farm-house, several hundred peach, apple and cherry trees, and a few acres of arable ground for which Gant received $120 a year in rent, and which they valued at $50 an acre, $5,500; two houses, one on Carter Street, and one on Duncan, rented to railway people, for which they received $25 a month apiece, and which they valued together at $4,500; forty-eight acres of land two miles above Biltburn, and four from Altamont, upon the important Reynoldsville Road, which they valued at $210 an acre, or $10,000; three houses in Niggertown--one on lower Valley Street, one on Beaumont Crescent, just below the negro Johnson's big house, and one on Short Oak, valued at $600, $900, and $1,600 respectively, and drawing a room-rental of $8, $12, and $17 a month (total: $3,100 and $37 rental); two houses across the river, four miles away in West Altamont, valued at $2,750 and at $3,500, drawing a rental of $22 and $30 a month; three lots, lost in the growth of a rough hillside, a mile from the main highway through West Altamont, $500; and a house, unoccupied, object of Gantian anathema, on Lower Hatton Avenue, $4,500.",1
710,"In addition, Gant held 10 shares, which were already worth $200 each ($2,000), in the newly organized Fidelity Bank; his stock of stones, monuments, and fly-specked angels represented an investment of $2,700, although he could not have sold them outright for so much; and he had about $3,000 deposited in the Fidelity, the Merchants, and the Battery Hill banks. Thus, at the beginning of 1912, before the rapid and intensive development of Southern industry, and the consequent tripling of Altamont's population, and before the multiplication of her land values, the wealth of Gant and Eliza amounted to about $100,000, the great bulk of which was solidly founded in juicy well chosen pieces of property of Eliza's selection, yielding them a monthly rental of more than $200, which, added to their own earning capacities at the shop and Dixieland, gave them a combined yearly income of $8,000 or $10,000. Although Gant often cried out bitterly against his business and declared, when he was not attacking property, that he had never made even a bare living from his tombstones, he was rarely short of ready money: he usually had one or two small commissions from country people, and he always carried a well-filled purse, containing $150 or $200 in five- and ten-dollar bills, which he allowed Eugene to count out frequently, enjoying his son's delight, and the feel of abundance.",1
711,"Eliza had suffered one or two losses in her investments, led astray by a strain of wild romanticism which destroyed for the moment her shrewd caution. She invested $1,200 in the Missouri Utopia of a colonizer, and received nothing for her money but a weakly copy of the man's newspaper, several beautiful prospectuses of the look of things when finished, and a piece of clay sculpture, eight inches in height, showing Big Brother with his little sisters Jenny and Kate, the last with thumb in her mouth. By God,"" said Gant, who made savage fun of the proceeding, ""she ought to have it on her nose.",1
712,"And Ben sneered, jerking his head toward it, saying:  ""There's her $1,200. But Eliza was preparing to go on by herself. She saw that co- operation with Gant in the purchase of land was becoming more difficult each year. And with something like pain, something assuredly like hunger, she saw various rich plums fall into other hands or go unbought. She realized that in a very short time land values would soar beyond her present means. And she proposed to be on hand when the pie was cut.",1
713,"Across the street from Dixieland was the Brunswick, a well-built red brick house of twenty rooms. The marble facings had been done by Gant himself twenty years before, the hardwood floors and oak timbering by Will Pentland. It was an ugly gabled Victorian house, the marriage gift of a rich Northerner to his daughter, who died of tuberculosis.",1
714,"Not a better built house in town,"" said Gant. Nevertheless he refused to buy it with Eliza, and with an aching heart she saw it go to St. Greenberg, the rich junk-man, for $8,500. Within a year he had sold off five lots at the back, on the Yancy Street side, for $1,000 each, and was holding the house for $20,000.",1
715,"We could have had our money back by now three times over,"" Eliza fretted. She did not have enough money at the time for any important investment. She saved and she waited.",1
716,"Will Pentland's fortune at this time was vaguely estimated at from $500,000 to $700,000. It was mainly in property, a great deal of which was situated--warehouses and buildings--near the passenger depot of the railway. Sometimes Altamont people, particularly the young men who loafed about Collister's drug-store, and who spent long dreamy hours estimating the wealth of the native plutocracy, called Will Pentland a millionaire. At this time it was a distinction in American life to be a millionaire. There were only six or eight thousand. But Will Pentland wasn't one. He was really worth only a half million.",1
717,"Mr. Goulderbilt was a millionaire. He was driven into town in a big Packard, but he got out and went along the streets like other men. One time Gant pointed him out to Eugene. He was about to enter a bank.",1
718,"There he is,"" whispered Gant. Do you see him?""  Eugene nodded, wagging his head mechanically. He was unable to speak. Mr. Goulderbilt was a small dapper man, with black hair, black clothes, and a black mustache. His hands and feet were small.",1
719,"He's got over $50,000,000,"" said Gant. You'd never think it to look at him, would you? And Eugene dreamed of these money princes living in a princely fashion. He wanted to see them riding down a street in a crested coach around which rode a teetering guard of liveried outriders. He wanted their fingers to be heavily gemmed, their clothes trimmed with ermine, their women coroneted with flashing mosaics of amethyst, beryl, ruby, topaz, sapphire, opal, emerald, and wearing thick ropes of pearls. And he wanted to see them living in palaces of alabaster columns, eating in vast halls upon an immense creamy table from vessels of old silver--eating strange fabulous foods-- swelling unctuous paps of a fat pregnant sow, oiled mushrooms, calvered salmon, jugged hare, the beards of barbels dressed with an exquisite and poignant sauce, carps' tongues, dormice and camels' heels, with spoons of amber headed with diamond and carbuncle, and cups of agate, studded with emeralds, hyacinths, and rubies-- everything, in fact, for which Epicure Mammon wished.",1
720,"Eugene met only one millionaire whose performances in public satisfied him, and he, unhappily, was crazy. His name was Simon. Simon, when Eugene first saw him, was a man of almost fifty years. He had a strong, rather heavy figure of middling height, a lean brown face, with shadowy hollows across the cheeks, always closely shaven, but sometimes badly scarred by his gouging fingernails, and a long thin mouth that curved slightly downward, subtle, sensitive, lighting his whole face at times with blazing demoniac glee. He had straight abundant hair, heavily grayed, which he kept smartly brushed and flattened at the sides. His clothing was loose and well cut: he wore a dark coat above baggy gray flannels, silk shirt rayed with broad stripes, a collar to match, and a generous loosely knotted tie. His waistcoats were of a ruddy-brown chequered pattern. He had an appearance of great distinction.",1
721,"Simon and his two keepers first came to Dixieland when difficulties with several of the Altamont hotels forced them to look for private quarters. The men took two rooms and a sleeping-porch, and paid generously. Why, pshaw!"" said Eliza persuasively to Helen. I don't believe there's a thing wrong with him. He's as quiet and well-behaved as you please. At this moment there was a piercing yell upstairs, followed by a long peal of diabolical laughter.",1
722,"Eugene bounded up and down the hall in his exultancy and delight, producing little squealing noises in his throat. Ben, scowling, with a quick flicker of his mouth, drew back his hard white hand swiftly as if to cuff his brother. Instead, he jerked his head sideways to Eliza, and said with a soft, scornful laugh: By God, mama, I don't see why you have to take them in. You've got enough of them in the family already. Mama, in heaven's name--"" Helen began furiously.",1
723,"At this moment Gant strode in out of the dusk, carrying a mottled package of pork chops, and muttering rhetorically to himself. There was another long peal of laughter above. He halted abruptly, startled, and lifted his head. Luke, listening attentively at the foot of the stairs, exploded in a loud boisterous guffaw, and the girl, her annoyance changing at once to angry amusement, walked toward her father's inquiring face, and prodded him several times in the ribs.",1
724,"Hey?"" he said startled. What is it?""  ""Miss Eliza's got a crazy man upstairs,"" she sniggered, enjoying his amazement. Jesus God! Gant yelled frantically, wetting his big thumb swiftly on his tongue, and glancing up toward his Maker with an attitude of exaggerated supplication in his small gray eyes and the thrust of his huge bladelike nose. Then, letting his arms slap heavily at his sides, in a gesture of defeat, he began to walk rapidly back and forth, clucking his deprecation loudly. Eliza stood solidly, looking from one to another, her lips working rapidly, her white face hurt and bitter.",1
725,"There was another long howl of mirth above. Gant paused, caught Helen's eye, and began to grin suddenly in an unwilling sheepish manner. God have mercy on us,"" he chuckled. She'll have the place filled with all of Barnum's freaks the next thing you know. At this moment, Simon, self-contained, distinguished and grave in his manner, descended the steps with Mr. Gilroy and Mr. Flannagan, his companions.",1
726,"The two guards were red in the face, and breathed stertorously as if from some recent exertion. Simon, however, preserved his habitual appearance of immaculate and well-washed urbanity. Good evening,"" he remarked suavely. I hope I have not kept you waiting long. He caught sight of Eugene.",1
727,"Come here, my boy,"" he said very kindly. It's all right,"" remarked Mr. Gilroy, encouragingly. He wouldn't hurt a fly. Eugene moved into the presence.",1
728,"And what is your name, young man?"" said Simon with his beautiful devil's smile. Eugene. That's a very fine name,"" said Simon.",1
729,"Always try to live up to it. He thrust his hand carelessly and magnificently into his coat pocket, drawing out under the boy's astonished eyes, a handful of shining five- and ten-cent pieces. Always be good to the birds, my boy,"" said Simon, and he poured the money into Eugene's cupped hands.",1
730,"Every one looked doubtfully at Mr. Gilroy. Oh, that's all right!"" said Mr. Gilroy cheerfully. He'll never miss it. There's lots more where that came from. He's a mul-tye-millionaire,"" Mr. Flannagan explained proudly.",1
731,"We give him four or five dollars in small change every morning just to throw away. Simon caught sight of Gant for the first time. Look out for the Stingaree,"" he cried. Remember the Maine. I tell you what,"" said Eliza laughing.",1
732,"He's not so crazy as you think. 'That's right,"" said Mr. Gilroy, noting Gant's grin. The Stingaree's a fish. They have them in Florida. Don't forget the birds, my friends,"" said Simon, going out with his companions.",1
733,"Be good to the birds. They became very fond of him. Somehow he fitted into the pattern of their life. None of them was uncomfortable in the presence of madness. In the flowering darkness of Spring, prisoned in a room, his satanic laughter burst suddenly out: Eugene listened, thrilled, and slept, unable to forget the smile of dark flowering evil, the loose pocket chinking heavily with coins.",1
734,"Night, the myriad rustle of tiny wings. Heard lapping water of the inland seas. --And the air will be filled with warm-throated plum-dropping bird- notes. He was almost twelve. He was done with childhood. As that Spring ripened he felt entirely, for the first time, the full delight of loneliness. Sheeted in his thin nightgown, he stood in darkness by the orchard window of the back room at Gant's, drinking the sweet air down, exulting in his isolation in darkness, hearing the strange wail of the whistle going west.",1
735,"The prison walls of self had closed entirely round him; he was walled completely by the esymplastic power of his imagination--he had learned by now to project mechanically, before the world, an acceptable counterfeit of himself which would protect him from intrusion. He no longer went through the torment of the recess flight and pursuit. He was now in one of the upper grades of grammar school, he was one of the Big Boys. His hair had been cut when he was nine years old, after a bitter siege against Eliza's obstinacy. He no longer suffered because of the curls. But he had grown like a weed, he already topped his mother by an inch or two; his body was big-boned but very thin and fragile, with no meat on it; his legs were absurdly long, thin, and straight, giving him a curious scissored look as he walked with long bounding strides.",1
736,"Stuck on a thin undeveloped neck beneath a big wide-browed head covered thickly by curling hair which had changed, since his infancy, from a light maple to dark brown-black, was a face so small, and so delicately sculptured, that it seemed not to belong to its body. The strangeness, the remote quality of this face was enhanced by its brooding fabulous concentration, by its passionate dark intensity, across which every splinter of thought or sensation flashed like a streak of light across a pool. The mouth was full, sensual, extraordinarily mobile, the lower lip deeply scooped and pouting. His rapt dreaming intensity set the face usually in an expression of almost sullen contemplation; he smiled, oftener than he laughed, inwardly, at some extravagant invention, or some recollection of the absurd, now fully appreciated for the first time. He did not open his lips to smile--there was a swift twisted flicker across his mouth. His thick heavily arched eyebrows grew straight across the base of his nose.",1
737,"That Spring he was more alone than ever. Eliza's departure for Dixieland three or four years before, and the disruption of established life at Gant's, had begun the loosening of his first friendships with the neighborhood boys, Harry Tarkinton, Max Isaacs, and the others, and had now almost completely severed them. Occasionally he saw these boys again, occasionally he resumed again, at sporadic intervals, his association with them, but he now had no steady companionship, he had only a series of associations with children whose parents stayed for a time at Dixieland, with Tim O'Doyle, whose mother ran the Brunswick, with children here and there who briefly held his interest.",1
738,"But he became passionately bored with them, plunged into a miasmic swamp of weariness and horror, after a time, because of the dullness and ugliness of their lives, their minds, their amusements. Dull people filled him with terror: he was never so much frightened by tedium in his own life as in the lives of others--his early distaste for Pett Pentland and her grim rusty aunts came from submerged memories of the old house on Central Avenue, the smell of mellow apples and medicine in the hot room, the swooping howl of the wind outside, and the endless monotone of their conversation on disease, death, and misery. He was filled with terror and anger against them because they were able to live, to thrive, in this horrible depression that sickened him.",1
739,"Thus, the entire landscape, the whole physical background of his life, was now dappled by powerful prejudices of liking and distaste formed, God knows how, or by what intangible affinities of thought, feeling and connotation. Thus, one street would seem to him to be a ""good street""--to exist in the rich light of cheerful, abundant, and high-hearted living; another, inexplicably, a ""bad street,"" touching him somehow with fear, hopelessness, depression. Perhaps the cold red light of some remembered winter's afternoon, waning pallidly over a playing-field, with all its mockery of Spring, while lights flared up smokily in houses, the rabble-rout of children dirtily went in to supper, and men came back to the dull but warm imprisonment of home, oil lamps (which he hated), and bedtime, clotted in him a hatred of the place which remained even when the sensations that caused it were forgotten.",1
740,"Or, returning from some country walk in late autumn, he would come back from Cove or Valley with dewy nose, clotted boots, the smell of a mashed persimmon on his knee, and the odor of wet earth and grass on the palms of his hands, and with a stubborn dislike and suspicion of the scene he had visited, and fear of the people who lived there. He had the most extraordinary love of incandescence. He hated dull lights, smoky lights, soft, or sombre lights. At night he wanted to be in rooms brilliantly illuminated with beautiful, blazing, sharp, poignant lights. After that, the dark.",1
741,"He played games badly, although he took a violent interest in sports. Max Isaacs continued to interest him as an athlete long after he had ceased to interest him as a person. The game Max Isaacs excelled in was baseball. Usually he played one of the outfield positions, ranging easily about in his field, when a ball was hit to him, with the speed of a panther, making impossible catches with effortless grace. He was a terrific hitter, standing at the plate casually but alertly, and meeting the ball squarely with a level swinging smack of his heavy shoulders. Eugene tried vainly to imitate the precision and power of this movement, which drove the ball in a smoking arc out of the lot, but he was never able: he chopped down clumsily and blindly, knocking a futile bounder to some nimble baseman. In the field he was equally useless: he never learned to play in a team, to become a limb of that single animal which united telepathically in a concerted movement. He became nervous, highly excited, and erratic in team- play, but he spent hours alone with another boy, or, after the mid- day meal, with Ben, passing a ball back and forth.",1
742,"He developed blinding speed, bending all the young suppleness of his long thin body behind the ball, exulting as it smoked into the pocket of the mitt with a loud smack, or streaked up with a sharp dropping curve. Ben, taken by surprise by a fast drop, would curse him savagely, and in a rage hurl the ball back into his thin gloved hand. In the Spring and Summer he went as often as he could afford it, or was invited, to the baseball games in the district league, a fanatic partisan of the town club and its best players, making a fantasy constantly of himself in a heroic game-saving rôle.",1
743,"But he was in no way able to submit himself to the discipline, the hard labor, the acceptance of defeat and failure that make a good athlete; he wanted always to win, he wanted always to be the general, the heroic spear-head of victory. And after that he wanted to be loved. Victory and love. In all of his swarming fantasies Eugene saw himself like this--unbeaten and beloved. But moments of clear vision returned to him when all the defeat and misery of his life was revealed. He saw his gangling and absurd figure, his remote unpractical brooding face, too like a dark strange flower to arouse any feeling among his companions and his kin, he thought, but discomfort, bitterness, and mockery; he remembered, with a drained sick heart, the countless humiliations, physical and verbal, he had endured, at the hands of school and family, before the world, and as he thought, the horns of victory died within the wood, the battle-drums of triumph stopped, the proud clangor of the gongs quivered away in silence. His eagles had flown; he saw himself, in a moment of reason, as a madman playing Cæsar. He craned his head aside and covered his face with his hand.",1
744,16   The Spring grew ripe. There was at mid-day a soft drowsiness in the sun. Warm sporting gusts of wind howled faintly at the eaves; the young grass bent; the daisies twinkled.,1
745,"He pressed his high knees uncomfortably against the bottom of his desk, grew nostalgic on his dreams. Bessie Barnes scrawled vigorously two rows away, displaying her long full silken leg. Open for me the gates of delight. Behind her sat a girl named Ruth, dark, with milk-white skin, eyes as gentle as her name, and thick black hair, parted in middle. He thought of a wild life with Bessie and of a later resurrection, a pure holy life, with Ruth.",1
746,"One day, after the noon recess, they were marshalled by the teachers--all of the children in the three upper grades--and marched upstairs to the big assembly hall. They were excited, and gossiped in low voices as they went. They had never been called upstairs at this hour. Quite often the bells rang in the halls: they sprang quickly into line and were marched out in double files. That was fire drill. They liked that. Once they emptied the building in four minutes.",1
747,"This was something new. They marched into the big room and sat down in blocks of seats assigned to each class: they sat with a seat between each of them. In a moment the door of the principal's office on the left--where little boys were beaten--was opened, and the principal came out. He walked around the corner of the big room and stepped softly up on the platform. He began to talk.",1
748,"He was a new principal. Young Armstrong, who had smelled the flower so delicately, and who had visited Daisy, and who once had almost beaten Eugene because of the smutty rhymes, was gone. The new principal was older. He was about thirty-eight years old. He was a strong rather heavy man a little under six feet tall; he was one of a large family who had grown up on a Tennessee farm. His father was poor but he had helped his children to get an education. All this Eugene knew already, because the principal made long talks to them in the morning and said he had never had their advantages. He pointed to himself with some pride. And he urged the little boys, playfully but earnestly, to ""be not like dumb, driven cattle, be a hero in the strife. That was poetry, Longfellow.",1
749,"The principal had thick powerful shoulders; clumsy white arms, knotted with big awkward country muscles. Eugene had seen him once hoeing in the schoolyard; each of them had been given a plant to set out. He got those muscles on the farm. The boys said he beat very hard. He walked with a clumsy stealthy tread--awkward and comical enough, it is true, but he could be up at a boy's back before you knew it. Otto Krause called him Creeping Jesus. The name stuck, among the tough crowd. Eugene was a little shocked by it.",1
750,"The principal had a white face of waxen transparency, with deep flat cheeks like the Pentlands, a pallid nose, a trifle deeper in its color than his face, and a thin slightly-bowed mouth. His hair was coarse, black, and thick, but he never let it grow too long. He had short dry hands, strong, and always coated deeply with chalk. When he passed near by, Eugene got the odor of chalk and of the schoolhouse: his heart grew cold with excitement and fear. The sanctity of chalk and school hovered about the man's flesh. He was the one who could touch without being touched, beat without being beaten. Eugene had terrible fantasies of resistance, shuddering with horror as he thought of the awful consequences of fighting back: something like God's fist in lightning. Then he looked around cautiously to see if any one had noticed.",1
751,"The principal's name was Leonard. He made long speeches to the children every morning, after a ten-minute prayer. He had a high sonorous countrified voice which often trailed off in a comical drawl; he got lost very easily in revery, would pause in the middle of a sentence, gaze absently off with his mouth half-open and an expression of stupefaction on his face, and return presently to the business before him, his mind still loose, with witless distracted laugh.",1
752,"He talked to the children aimlessly, pompously, dully for twenty minutes every morning: the teachers yawned carefully behind their hands, the students made furtive drawings, or passed notes. He spoke to them of ""the higher life"" and of ""the things of the mind. He assured them that they were the leaders of to-morrow and the hope of the world. Then he quoted Longfellow.",1
753,"He was a good man, a dull man, a man of honor. He had a broad streak of coarse earthy brutality in him. He loved a farm better than anything in the world except a school. He had rented a big dilapidated house in a grove of lordly oaks on the outskirts of town: he lived there with his wife and his two children. He had a cow--he was never without a cow: he would go out at night and morning to milk her, laughing his vacant silly laugh, and giving her a good smacking kick in the belly to make her come round into position.",1
754,"He was a heavy-handed master. He put down rebellion with good cornfield violence. If a boy was impudent to him he would rip him powerfully from his seat, drag his wriggling figure into his office, breathing stertorously as he walked along at his clumsy rapid gait, and saying roundly, in tones of scathing contempt: ""Why, you young upstart, we'll just see who's master here. I'll show you, my sonny, if I'm to be dictated to by every two-by-four whippersnapper who comes along. And once within the office, with the glazed door shut, he published the stern warning of his justice by the loud exertion of his breathing, the cutting swish of his rattan, and the yowls of pain and terror that he exacted from his captive.",1
755,"He had called the school together that day to command it to write him a composition. The children sat, staring dumbly up at him as he made a rambling explanation of what he wanted. Finally he announced a prize. He would give five dollars from his own pocket to the student who wrote the best paper. That aroused them. There was a rustle of interest.",1
756,"They were to write a paper on the meaning of a French picture called The Song of the Lark. It represented a French peasant girl, barefooted, with a sickle in one hand, and with face upturned in the morning-light of the fields as she listened to the bird-song. They were asked to describe what they saw in the expression of the girl's face. They were asked to tell what the picture meant to them. It had been reproduced in one of their readers. A larger print was now hung up on the platform for their inspection. Sheets of yellow paper were given them. They stared, thoughtfully masticating their pencils. Finally, the room was silent save for a minute scratching on paper.",1
757,"The warm wind spouted about the eaves; the grasses bent, whistling gently. Eugene wrote:  ""The girl is hearing the song of the first lark. She knows that it means Spring has come. She is about seventeen or eighteen years old. Her people are very poor, she has never been anywhere. In the winter she wears wooden shoes. She is making out as if she was going to whistle. But she doesn't let on to the bird that she has heard him. The rest of her people are behind her, coming down the field, but we do not see them. She has a father, a mother, and two brothers. They have worked hard all their life. The girl is the youngest child. She thinks she would like to go away somewhere and see the world. Sometimes she hears the whistle of a train that is going to Paris. She has never ridden on a train in her life. She would like to go to Paris. She would like to have some fine clothes, she would like to travel. Perhaps she would like to start life new in America, the Land of Opportunity. The girl has had a hard time. Her people do not understand her. If they saw her listening to the lark they would poke fun at her. She has never had the advantages of a good education, her people are so poor, but she would profit by her opportunity if she did, more than some people who have. You can tell by looking at her that she's intelligent. It was early in May; examinations came in another two weeks.",1
758,"He thought of them with excitement and pleasure--he liked the period of hard cramming, the long reviews, the delight of emptying out abundantly on paper his stored knowledge. The big assembly room had about it the odor of completion, of sharp nervous ecstasy. All through the summer it would be drowsy-warm; if only here, alone, with the big plaster cast of Minerva, himself and Bessie Barnes, or Miss--Miss--  ""We want this boy,"" said Margaret Leonard.",1
759,She handed Eugene's paper over to her husband. They were starting a private school for boys. That was what the paper had been for.,1
760,"Leonard took the paper, pretended to read half a page, looked off absently into eternity, and began to rub his chin reflectively, leaving a slight coating of chalk-dust on his face. Then, catching her eye, he laughed idiotically, and said:  ""Why, that little rascal! Huh? Do you suppose--? Feeling delightfully scattered, he bent over with a long suction of whining laughter, slapping his knee and leaving a chalk print, making a slobbering noise in his mouth.",1
761,"The Lord have mercy! he gasped. Here! Never you mind about that,"" she said, laughing with tender sharp amusement. Pull yourself together and see this boy's people. She loved the man dearly, and he loved her.",1
762,"A few days later Leonard assembled the children a second time. He made a rambling speech, the purport of which was to inform them that one of them had won the prize, but to conceal the winner's name. Then, after several divagations, which he thoroughly enjoyed, he read Eugene's paper, announced his name, and called him forward.",1
763,"Chalkface took chalkhand. The boy's heart thundered against his ribs. The proud horns blared, he tasted glory.",1
764,"Patiently, all through the summer, Leonard laid siege to Gant and Eliza. Gant fidgeted, spoke shiftily, finally said:  ""You'll have to see his mother. Privately he was bitterly scornful, roared the merits of the public school as an incubator of citizenship. The family was contemptuous. Private school! Mr. Vanderbilt! Ruin him for good!",1
765,Which made Eliza reflective. She had a good streak of snobbism. Mr. Vanderbilt? She was as good as any of them. They'd just see.,1
766,"Who are you going to have? she asked. Have you drummed any one up yet? Leonard mentioned the sons of several fashionable and wealthy people,--of Dr. Kitchen, the eye, ear, nose and throat man, Mr. Arthur, the corporation lawyer, and Bishop Raper, of the Episcopal diocese.",1
767,Eliza grew more reflective. She thought of Pett. She needn't give herself airs.,1
768,"How much are you asking?"" she said. He told her the tuition was one hundred dollars a year. She pursed her lips lingeringly before she answered.",1
769,"Hm-m! she began, with a bantering smile, as she looked at Eugene. That's a whole lot of money. You know,"" she continued with her tremulous smile, ""as the darkey says, we're pore-folks. Eugene squirmed.",1
770,"Well what about it, boy?"" said Eliza banteringly. Do you think you're worth that much money?""  Mr. Leonard placed his white dry hand upon Eugene's shoulders, affectionately sliding it down his back and across his kidneys, leaving white chalk prints everywhere. Then he clamped his meaty palm tightly around the slender bracelet of boy-arm.",1
771,"That boy's worth it,"" he said, shaking him gently to and fro. Yes, sir!""  Eugene smiled painfully. Eliza continued to purse her lips. She felt a strong psychic relation to Leonard. They both took time.",1
772,"Say,"" she said, rubbing her broad red nose, and smiling slyly, ""I used to be a school-teacher. You didn't know that, did you? But I didn't get any such prices as you're asking,"" she added. I thought myself mighty lucky if I got my board and twenty dollars a month. Is that so, Mrs. Gant?"" said Mr. Leonard with great interest.",1
773,"Well, sir! He began to laugh in a vague whine, pulling Eugene about more violently and deadening his arm under his crushing grip. Yes,"" said Eliza, ""I remember my father--it was long before you were born, boy,"" she said to Eugene, ""for I hadn't laid eyes on your papa--as the feller says, you were nothing but a dish-rag hanging out in heaven--I'd have laughed at any one who suggested marriage then--Well, I tell you what [she shook her head with a sad pursed deprecating mouth], we were mighty poor at the time, I can tell you.--I was thinking about it the other day--many's the time we didn't have food in the house for the next meal.--Well, as I was saying, your grandfather [addressing Eugene] came home one night and said--Look here, what about it?--Who do you suppose I saw to- day?--I remember him just as plain as if I saw him standing here--I had a feeling--[addressing Leonard with a doubtful smile] I don't know what you'd call it but it's pretty strange when you come to think about it, isn't it?--I had just finished helping Aunt Jane set the table--she had come all the way from Yancey County to visit your grandmother--when all of a sudden it flashed over me--mind you [to Leonard] I never looked out the window or anything but I knew just as well as I knew anything that he was coming--mercy I cried-- here comes--why what on earth are you talking about, Eliza? said your grandma--I remember she went to the door and looked out down the path--there's no one there--He's acoming, I said--wait and see-- Who? said your grandmother--Why, father, I said--he's carrying something on his shoulder--and sure enough--I had no sooner got the words out of my mouth than there he was just acoming it for all he was worth, up the path, with a tow-sack full of apples on his back-- you could tell by the way he walked that he had news of some sort-- well--sure enough--without stopping to say howdy-do--I remembered he began to talk almost before he got into the house--O father, I called out--you've brought the apples--it was the year after I had almost died of pneumonia--I'd been spitting up blood ever since-- and having hemorrhages--and I asked him to bring me some apples-- Well sir, mother said to him, and she looked mighty queer, I can tell you--that's the strangest thing I ever heard of--and she told him what had happened--Well, he looked pretty serious and said-- Yes, I'll never forget the way he said it--I reckon she saw me. I wasn't there but I was thinking of being there and coming up the path at that very moment--I've got news for you he said--who do you suppose I saw to-day--why, I've no idea, I said--why old Professor Truman--he came rushing up to me in town and said, see here: where's Eliza--I've got a job for her if she wants it, teaching school this winter out on Beaverdam--why, pshaw, said your grandfather, she's never taught school a day in her life--and Professor Truman laughed just as big as you please and said never you mind about that--Eliza can do anything she sets her mind on-- well sir, that's the way it all came about. High-sorrowful and sad, she paused for a moment, adrift, her white face slanting her life back through the aisled grove of years.",1
774,"Well, sir!"" said Mr. Leonard vaguely, rubbing his chin. You young rascal, you!"" he said, giving Eugene another jerk, and beginning to laugh with narcissistic pleasure. Eliza pursed her lips slowly.",1
775,"Well,"" she said, ""I'll send him to you for a year. That was the way she did business. Tides run deep in Sargasso.",1
776,"So, on the hairline of million-minded impulse, destiny bore down on his life again. Mr. Leonard had leased an old pre-war house, set on a hill wooded by magnificent trees. It faced west and south, looking toward Biltburn, and abruptly down on South End, and the negro flats that stretched to the depot. One day early in September he took Eugene there. They walked across town, talking weightily of politics, across the Square, down Hatton Avenue, south into Church, and southwesterly along the bending road that ended in the schoolhouse on the abutting hill. The huge trees made sad autumn music as they entered the grounds. In the broad hall of the squat rambling old house Eugene for the first time saw Margaret Leonard. She held a broom in her hands, and was aproned. But his first impression was of her shocking fragility.",1
777,"Margaret Leonard at this time was thirty-four years old. She had borne two children, a son who was now six years old, and a daughter who was two. As she stood there, with her long slender fingers splayed about the broomstick, he noted, with a momentary cold nausea, that the tip of her right index finger was flattened out as if it had been crushed beyond healing by a hammer. But it was years before he knew that tuberculars sometimes have such fingers.",1
778,"Margaret Leonard was of middling height, five feet six inches perhaps. As the giddiness of his embarrassment wore off he saw that she could not weigh more than eighty or ninety pounds. He had heard of the children. Now he remembered them, and Leonard's white muscular bulk, with a sense of horror. His swift vision leaped at once to the sexual relation, and something in him twisted aside, incredulous and afraid.",1
779,"She had on a dress of crisp gray gingham, not loose or lapping round her wasted figure, but hiding every line in her body, like a draped stick. As his mind groped out of the pain of impression he heard her voice and, still feeling within him the strange convulsive shame, he lifted his eyes to her face. It was the most tranquil and the most passionate face he had ever seen. The skin was sallow with a dead ashen tinge; beneath, the delicate bone-carving of face and skull traced itself clearly: the cadaverous tightness of those who are about to die had been checked. She had won her way back just far enough to balance carefully in the scales of disease and recovery. It was necessary for her to measure everything she did.",1
780,"Her thin face was given a touch of shrewdness and decision by the straight line of her nose, the fine long carving of her chin. Beneath the sallow minute pitted skin in her cheeks, and about her mouth, several frayed nerve-centres twitched from moment to moment, jarring the skin slightly without contorting or destroying the passionate calm beauty that fed her inexhaustibly from within. This face was the constant field of conflict, nearly always calm, but always reflecting the incessant struggle and victory of the enormous energy that inhabited her, over the thousand jangling devils of depletion and weariness that tried to pull her apart. There was always written upon her the epic poetry of beauty and repose out of struggle--he never ceased to feel that she had her hand around the reins of her heart, that gathered into her grasp were all the straining wires and sinews of disunion which would scatter and unjoint her members, once she let go. Literally, physically, he felt that, the great tide of valiance once flowed out of her, she would immediately go to pieces. She was like some great general, famous, tranquil, wounded unto death, who, with his fingers clamped across a severed artery, stops for an hour the ebbing of his life--sends on the battle.",1
781,"Her hair was coarse and dull-brown, fairly abundant, tinged lightly with gray: it was combed evenly in the middle and bound tightly in a knot behind. Everything about her was very clean, like a scrubbed kitchen board: she took his hand, he felt the firm nervous vitality of her fingers, and he noticed how clean and scrubbed her thin somewhat labor-worn hands were. If he noticed her emaciation at all now, it was only with a sense of her purification: he felt himself in union not with disease, but with the greatest health he had ever known. She made a high music in him. His heart lifted.",1
782,"This,"" said Mr. Leonard, stroking him gently across the kidneys, ""is Mister Eugene Gant. Well, sir,"" she said, in a low voice, in which a vibrant wire was thrumming, ""I'm glad to know you. The voice had in it that quality of quiet wonder that he had sometimes heard in the voices of people who had seen or were told of some strange event, or coincidence, that seemed to reach beyond life, beyond nature--a note of acceptance; and suddenly he knew that all life seemed eternally strange to this woman, that she looked directly into the beauty and the mystery and the tragedy in the hearts of men, and that he seemed beautiful to her.",1
783,"Her face darkened with the strange passionate vitality that left no print, that lived there bodiless like life; her brown eyes darkened into black as if a bird had flown through them and left the shadow of its wings. She saw his small remote face burning strangely at the end of his long unfleshed body, she saw the straight thin shanks, the big feet turned awkwardly inward, the dusty patches on his stockings at the knees, and his thin wristy arms that stuck out painfully below his cheap ill-fitting jacket; she saw the thin hunched line of his shoulders, the tangled mass of hair--and she did not laugh. He turned his face up to her as a prisoner who recovers light, as a man long pent in darkness who bathes himself in the great pool of dawn, as a blind man who feels upon his eyes the white core and essence of immutable brightness. His body drank in her great light as a famished castaway the rain: he closed his eyes and let the great light bathe him, and when he opened them again, he saw that her own were luminous and wet.",1
784,"Then she began to laugh. Why, Mr. Leonard,"" she said, ""what in the world! He's almost as tall as you. Here, boy.  Stand up here while I measure. Deft-fingered, she put them back to back. Mr. Leonard was two or three inches taller than Eugene. He began to whine with laughter.",1
785,"Why, the rascal,"" he said. That little shaver. How old are you, boy?"" she asked.",1
786,"I'll be twelve next month,"" he said. Well, what do you know about that! she said wonderingly. I tell you what, though,"" she continued. We've got to get some meat on those bones. You can't go around like that. I don't like the way you look. She shook her head.",1
787,"He was uncomfortable, disturbed, vaguely resentful. It embarrassed and frightened him to be told that he was ""delicate""; it touched sharply on his pride. She took him into a big room on the left that had been fitted out as a living-room and library. She watched his face light with eagerness as he saw the fifteen hundred or two thousand books shelved away in various places. He sat down clumsily in a wicker chair by the table and waited until she returned, bringing him a plate of sandwiches and a tall glass full of clabber, which he had never tasted before.",1
788,"When he had finished, she drew a chair near to his, and sat down. She had previously sent Leonard out on some barnyard errands; he could be heard from time to time shouting in an authoritative country voice to his live stock. Well, tell me boy,"" she said, ""what have you been reading?""  Craftily he picked his way across the waste land of printery, naming as his favorites those books which he felt would win her approval.",1
789,"As he had read everything, good and bad, that the town library contained, he was able to make an impressive showing. Sometimes she stopped him to question about a book--he rebuilt the story richly with a blazing tenacity of detail that satisfied her wholly. She was excited and eager--she saw at once how abundantly she could feed this ravenous hunger for knowledge, experience, wisdom. And he knew suddenly the joy of obedience: the wild ignorant groping, the blind hunt, the desperate baffled desire was now to be ruddered, guided, controlled. The way through the passage to India, that he had never been able to find, would now be charted for him. Before he went away she had given him a fat volume of nine hundred pages, shot through with spirited engravings of love and battle, of the period he loved best.",1
790,"He was drowned deep at midnight in the destiny of the man who killed the bear, the burner of windmills and the scourge of banditry, in all the life of road and tavern in the Middle Ages, in valiant and beautiful Gerard, the seed of genius, the father of Erasmus. Eugene thought The Cloister and the Hearth the best story he had ever read. The Altamont Fitting School was the greatest venture of their lives. All the delayed success that Leonard had dreamed of as a younger man he hoped to realize now. For him the school was independence, mastership, power, and, he hoped, prosperity. For her, teaching was its own exceeding great reward--her lyric music, her life, the world in which plastically she built to beauty what was good, the lord of her soul that gave her spirit life while he broke her body.",1
791,"In the cruel volcano of the boy's mind, the little brier moths of his idolatry wavered in to their strange marriage and were consumed. One by one the merciless years reaped down his gods and captains. What had lived up to hope? What had withstood the scourge of growth and memory? Why had the gold become so dim? All of his life, it seemed, his blazing loyalties began with men and ended with images; the life he leaned on melted below his weight, and looking down, he saw he clasped a statue; but enduring, a victorious reality amid his shadow-haunted heart, she remained, who first had touched his blinded eyes with light, who nested his hooded houseless soul. She remained.",1
792,"O death in life that turns our men to stone! O change that levels down our gods! If only one lives yet, above the cinders of the consuming years, shall not this dust awaken, shall not dead faith revive, shall we not see God again, as once in morning, on the mountain? Who walks with us on the hills?    17   Eugene spent the next four years of his life in Leonard's school.",1
793,"Against the bleak horror of Dixieland, against the dark road of pain and death down which the great limbs of Gant had already begun to slope, against all the loneliness and imprisonment of his own life which had gnawed him like hunger, these years at Leonard's bloomed like golden apples. From Leonard he got little--a dry campaign over an arid waste of Latin prose: first, a harsh, stiff, unintelligent skirmishing among the rules of grammar, which frightened and bewildered him needlessly, and gave him for years an unhealthy dislike of syntax, and an absurd prejudice against the laws on which the language was built. Then, a year's study of the lean, clear precision of Cæsar, the magnificent structure of the style--the concision, the skeleton certainty, deadened by the disjointed daily partition, the dull parsing, the lumbering cliché of pedantic translation:  ""Having done all things that were necessary, and the season now being propitious for carrying on war, Cæsar began to arrange his legions in battle array.",1
794,"All the dark pageantry of war in Gaul, the thrust of the Roman spear through the shield of hide, the barbaric parleys in the forests, and the proud clangor of triumph--all that might have been supplied in the story of the great realist, by one touch of the transforming passion with which a great teacher projects his work, was lacking. Instead, glibly, the wheels ground on into the hard rut of method and memory. March 12, last year--three days late. Cogitata. Neut. pl. of participle used as substantive. Quo used instead of ut to express purpose when comparative follows. Eighty lines for to-morrow.",1
795,"They spent a weary age, two years, on that dull dog, Cicero. De Senectute. De Amicitia. They skirted Virgil because John Dorsey Leonard was a bad sailor--he was not at all sure of Virgilian navigation. He hated exploration. He distrusted voyages. Next year, he said. And the great names of Ovid, lord of the elves and gnomes, the Bacchic piper of Amores, or of Lucretius, full of the rhythm of tides. Nox est perpetua.",1
796,"Huh?"" drawled Mr. Leonard, vacantly beginning to laugh. He was fingermarked with chalk from chin to crotch. Stephen (""Pap"") Rheinhart leaned forward gently and fleshed his penpoint in Eugene Gant's left rump. Eugene grunted painfully.",1
797,"Why, no,"" said Mr. Leonard, stroking his chin. A different sort of Latin. What sort?"" Tom Davis insisted.",1
798,"Harder than Cicero?""  ""Well,"" said Mr. Leonard, dubiously, ""different. A little beyond you at present. --est perpetua.",1
799,Una dormienda. Luna dies et nox. Is Latin poetry hard to read?,1
800,"Eugene said. Well,"" said Mr. Leonard, shaking his head. It's not easy. Horace-- he began carefully.",1
801,"He wrote Odes and Epodes,"" said Tom Davis. What is an Epode, Mr. Leonard?""  ""Why,"" said Mr. Leonard reflectively, ""it's a form of poetry. Hell!"" said ""Pap"" Rheinhart in a rude whisper to Eugene.",1
802,"I knew that before I paid tuition. Smiling lusciously, and stroking himself with gentle fingers, Mr. Leonard turned back to the lesson. Now let me see,"" he began.",1
803,"Who was Catullus? Eugene shouted violently. Like a flung spear in his brain, the name.",1
804,"He was a poet,"" Mr. Leonard answered thoughtlessly, quickly, startled. He regretted. What sort of poetry did he write?"" asked Eugene.",1
805,"There was no answer. Was it like Horace?""  ""No-o,"" said Mr. Leonard reflectively. It wasn't exactly like Horace. What was it like?"" said Tom Davis.",1
806,"Like your granny's gut,"" ""Pap"" Rheinhart toughly whispered. Why--he wrote on topics of general interest in his day,"" said Mr. Leonard easily. Did he write about being in love?"" said Eugene in a quivering voice.",1
807,"Tom Davis turned a surprised face on him. Gre-a-at Day!"" he exclaimed, after a moment. Then he began to laugh.",1
808,"He wrote about being in love,"" Eugene cried with sudden certain passion. He wrote about being in love with a lady named Lesbia. Ask Mr. Leonard if you don't believe me. They turned thirsty faces up to him.",1
809,"Why--no--yes--I don't know about all that,"" said Mr. Leonard, challengingly, confused. Where'd you hear all this, boy?""  ""I read it in a book,"" said Eugene, wondering where. Like a flung spear, the name.  --Whose tongue was fanged like a serpent, flung spear of ecstasy and passion.",1
810,"Odi et amo: quore id faciam . . . Well, not altogether,"" said Mr. Leonard. Some of them,"" he conceded.  . .",1
811,". fortasse requiris. Nescio, sed fieri sentio et excrucior.",1
812,"Who was she?"" said Tom Davis. Oh, it was the custom in those days,"" said Mr. Leonard carelessly. Like Dante and Beatrice. It was a way the poet had of paying a compliment. The serpent whispered.",1
813,"There was a distillation of wild exultancy in his blood. The rags of obedience, servility, reverential awe dropped in a belt around him. She was a man's wife! he said loudly. That's who she was. Awful stillness.",1
814,"Why--here--who told you that?"" said Mr. Leonard, bewildered, but considering matrimony a wild and possibly dangerous myth. Who told you, boy?""  ""What was she, then?"" said Tom Davis pointedly. Why--not exactly,"" Mr. Leonard murmured, rubbing his chin.",1
815,"She was a Bad Woman,"" said Eugene. Then, most desperately, he added:  ""She was a Little Chippie. Pap"" Rheinhart drew in his breath sharply.",1
816,"What's that, what's that, what's that?"" cried Mr. Leonard rapidly when he could speak. Fury boiled up in him. He sprang from his chair. What did you say, boy?",1
817,"But he thought of Margaret and looked down, with a sudden sense of palsy, into the white ruination of boy-face. Too far beyond. He sat down again, shaken.",1
818,"--Whose foulest cry was shafted with his passion, whose greatest music flowered out of filth--        ""Nulla potest mulier tantum se dicere amatam       Vere, quantum a me Lesbia amata mea es. You should be more careful of your talk, Eugene,"" said Mr. Leonard gently. See here! he exclaimed suddenly, turning with violence to his book. This is getting no work done. Come on, now! he said heartily, spitting upon his intellectual hands. You rascals you! he said, noting Tom Davis' grin. I know what you're after--you want to take up the whole period. Tom Davis' hearty laughter boomed out, mingling with his own whine.",1
819,"All right, Tom,"" said Mr. Leonard briskly, ""page 43, section 6, line 15. Begin at that point. At this moment the bell rang and Tom Davis' laughter filled the room.",1
820,"Nevertheless, in charted lanes of custom, he gave competent instruction. He would perhaps have had difficulty in constructing a page of Latin prose and verse with which he had not become literally familiar by years of repetition. In Greek, certainly, his deficiency would have been even more marked, but he would have known a second aorist or an optative in the dark (if he had ever met it before). There were two final years of precious Greek: they read the Anabasis.",1
821,"What's the good of all this stuff?"" said Tom Davis argumentatively. Mr. Leonard was on sure ground here. He understood the value of the classics.",1
822,"It teaches a man to appreciate the Finer Things. It gives him the foundations of a liberal education. It trains his mind. What good's it going to do him when he goes to work?"" said ""Pap"" Rheinhart.",1
823,"It's not going to teach him how to grow more corn. Well--I'm not so sure of that,"" said Mr. Leonard with a protesting laugh. I think it does. Pap"" Rheinhart looked at him with a comical cock of the head.",1
824,"He had a wry neck, which gave his humorous kindly face a sidelong expression of quizzical maturity. He had a gruff voice; he was full of rough kindly humor, and chewed tobacco constantly. His father was wealthy. He lived on a big farm in the Cove, ran a dairy and had a foundry in the town. They were unpretending people--German stock.",1
825,"Pshaw, Mr. Leonard,"" said ""Pap"" Rheinhart. Are you going to talk Latin to your farmhands?""  ""Egibus wantibus a peckibus of cornibus,"" said Tom Davis with sounding laughter. Mr. Leonard laughed with abstracted appreciation. The joke was his own.",1
826,"It trains the mind to grapple with problems of all sorts,"" he said. According to what you say,"" said Tom Davis, ""a man who has studied Greek makes a better plumber than one who hasn't. Yes, sir,"" said Mr. Leonard, shaking his head smartly, ""you know, I believe he does.",1
827,"He joined, pleased, with their pleasant laughter, a loose slobbering giggle. He was on trodden ground. They engaged him in long debates: as he ate his lunch, he waved a hot biscuit around, persuasive, sweetly reasonable, exhaustively minute in an effort to prove the connection of Greek and groceries. The great wind of Athens had touched him not at all. Of the delicate and sensuous intelligence of the Greeks, their feminine grace, the constructive power and subtlety of their intelligence, the instability of their character, and the structure, restraint and perfection of their forms, he said nothing.",1
828,"He had caught a glimpse, in an American college, of the great structure of the most architectural of languages: he felt the sculptural perfection of such a word as [Greek word], but his opinions smelled of chalk, the classroom, and a very bad lamp-- Greek was good because it was ancient, classic, and academic. The smell of the East, the dark tide of the Orient that flowed below, touched the lives of poet and soldier, with something perverse, evil, luxurious, was as far from his life as Lesbos. He was simply the mouthpiece of a formula of which he was assured without having a genuine belief.",1
829,"[Greek phrase]   The mathematics and history teacher was John Dorsey's sister Amy. She was a powerful woman, five feet ten inches tall, who weighed 185 pounds. She had very thick black hair, straight and oily, and very black eyes, giving a heavy sensuousness to her face. Her thick forearms were fleeced with light down. She was not fat, but she corsetted tightly, her powerful arms and heavy shoulders bulging through the cool white of her shirtwaists. In warm weather she perspired abundantly: her waists were stained below the arm- pits with big spreading blots of sweat; in the winter, as she warmed herself by the fire, she had about her the exciting odor of chalk, and the strong good smell of a healthy animal. Eugene, passing down the wind-swept back porch one day in winter, looked in on her room just as her tiny niece opened the door to come out. She sat before a dancing coal-fire, after her bath, drawing on her stockings. Fascinated, he stared at her broad red shoulders, her big body steaming cleanly like a beast.",1
830,"She liked the fire and the radiance of warmth: sleepily alert she sat by the stove, with her legs spread, sucking in the heat, her large earth strength more heavily sensuous than her brother's. Stroked by the slow heat-tingle she smiled slowly with indifferent affection on all the boys. No men came to see her: like a pool she was thirsty for lips. She sought no one. With lazy cat-warmth she smiled on all the world.",1
831,"She was a good teacher of mathematics: number to her was innate. Lazily she took their tablets, worked answers lazily, smiling good- naturedly with contempt. Behind her, at a desk, Durand Jarvis moaned passionately to Eugene, and writhed erotically, gripping the leaf of his desk fiercely.",1
832,"Sister Sheba arrived with her consumptive husband at the end of the second year--cadaver, flecked lightly on the lips with blood, seventy-three years old. They said he was forty-nine--sickness made him look old. He was a tall man, six feet three, with long straight mustaches, waxen and emaciated as a mandarin. He painted pictures--impressionist blobs--sheep on a gorsey hill, fishboats at the piers, with a warm red jumble of brick buildings in the background.",1
833,"Old Gloucester Town, Marblehead, Cape Cod Folks, Captains Courageous--the rich salty names came reeking up with a smell of tarred rope, dry codheads rotting in the sun, rocking dories knee- deep in gutted fish, the strong loin-smell of the sea in harbors, and the quiet brooding vacancy of a seaman's face, sign of his marriage with ocean. How look the seas at dawn in Spring? The cold gulls sleep upon the wind. But rose the skies.",1
834,"They saw the waxen mandarin walk shakily three times up and down the road. It was Spring, there was a south wind high in the big trees. He wavered along on a stick, planted before him with a blue phthisic hand. His eyes were blue and pale as if he had been drowned.",1
835,"He had begotten two children by Sheba--girls. They were exotic tender blossoms, all black and milky white, as strange and lovely as Spring. The boys groped curiously.",1
836,"He must be a better man than he looks yet,"" said Tom Davis. The little 'un's only two or three years old. He's not as old as he looks,"" said Eugene.",1
837,"He looks old because he's been sick. He's only forty-nine. How do you know?"" said Tom Davis.",1
838,"Miss Amy says so,"" said Eugene innocently. Pap"" Rheinhart cocked his head on Eugene and carried his quid deftly on the end of his tongue to the other cheek. Forty-nine! he said, ""you'd better see a doctor, boy. He's as old as God. That's what she said,"" Eugene insisted doggedly.",1
839,"Why, of course she said it! Pap"" Rheinhart replied. You don't think they're going to let it out, do you? When they're running a school here. Son, you must be simple!"" said Jack Candler who had not thought of it up to now.",1
840,"Hell, you're their Pet. They know you'll believe whatever they tell you,"" said Julius Arthur. Pap"" Rheinhart looked at him searchingly, then shook his head as if a cure was impossible. They laughed at his faith.",1
841,"Well, if he's so old,"" said Eugene, ""why did old Lady Lattimer marry him? Why, because she couldn't get any one else, of course,"" said ""Pap"" Rheinhart, impatient at this obtuseness. Do you suppose she has had to keep him up?"" said Tom Davis curiously. Silently they wondered. And Eugene, as he saw the two lovely children fall like petals from their mother's heavy breast, as he saw the waxen artist faltering his last steps to death, and heard Sheba's strong voice leveling a conversation at its beginning, expanding in violent burlesque all of her opinions, was bewildered again before the unsearchable riddle--out of death, life, out of the coarse rank earth, a flower.",1
842,"His faith was above conviction. Disillusion had come so often that it had awakened in him a strain of bitter suspicion, an occasional mockery, virulent, coarse, cruel, and subtle, which was all the more scalding because of his own pain. Unknowingly, he had begun to build up in himself a vast mythology for which he cared all the more deeply because he realized its untruth. Brokenly, obscurely, he was beginning to feel that it was not truth that men live for-- the creative men--but for falsehood. At times his devouring, unsated brain seemed to be beyond his governance: it was a frightful bird whose beak was in his heart, whose talons tore unceasingly at his bowels. And this unsleeping demon wheeled, plunged, revolved about an object, returning suddenly, after it had flown away, with victorious malice, leaving stripped, mean, and common all that he had clothed with wonder.",1
843,"But he saw hopefully that he never learned--that what remained was the tinsel and the gold. He was so bitter with his tongue because his heart believed so much. The merciless brain lay coiled and alert like a snake: it saw every gesture, every quick glance above his head, the shoddy scaffolding of all reception. But these people existed for him in a world remote from human error. He opened one window of his heart to Margaret, together they entered the sacred grove of poetry; but all dark desire, the dream of fair forms, and all the misery, drunkenness, and disorder of his life at home he kept fearfully shut. He was afraid they would hear. Desperately he wondered how many of the boys had heard of it. And all the facts that levelled Margaret down to life, that plunged her in the defiling stream of life, were as unreal and horrible as a nightmare.",1
844,"That she had been near death from tuberculosis, that the violent and garrulous Sheba had married an old man, who had begotten two children and was now about to die, that the whole little family, powerful in cohesive fidelity, were nursing their great sores in privacy, building up before the sharp eyes and rattling tongues of young boys a barrier of flimsy pretense and evasion, numbed him with a sense of unreality. Eugene believed in the glory and the gold. He lived more at Dixieland now. He had been more closely bound to Eliza since he began at Leonard's. Gant, Helen, and Luke were scornful of the private school. The children were resentful of it-- a little jealous. And their temper was barbed now with a new sting. They would say:  ""You've ruined him completely since you sent him to a private school.",1
845,"Or, ""He's too good to soil his hands now that he's quit the public school. Eliza herself kept him sufficiently reminded of his obligation. She spoke often of the effort she had to make to pay the tuition fee, and of her poverty. She said, he must work hard, and help her all he could in his spare hours. He should also help her through the summer and ""drum up trade"" among the arriving tourists at the station.",1
846,"For God's sake! What's the matter with you? Luke jeered. You're not ashamed of a little honest work, are you?""  This way, sir, for Dixieland.",1
847,"Mrs. Eliza E. Gant, proprietor. Just A Whisper Off The Square, Captain. All the comforts of the Modern Jail. Biscuits and home-made pies just like mother should have made but didn't.",1
848,"That boy's a hustler. At the end of Eugene's first year at Leonard's, Eliza told John Dorsey she could no longer afford to pay the tuition. He conferred with Margaret and, returning, agreed to take the boy for half price.",1
849,"He can help you drum up new prospects,"" said Eliza. Yes,"" Leonard agreed, ""that's the very thing. Ben bought a new pair of shoes.",1
850,They were tan. He paid six dollars for them. He always bought good things. But they burnt the soles of his feet. In a scowling rage he loped to his room and took them off.,1
851,"Goddam it! he yelled, and hurled them at the wall. Eliza came to the door.",1
852,"You'll never have a penny, boy, as long as you waste money the way you do. I tell you what, it's pretty bad when you think of it. She shook her head sadly with puckered mouth.",1
853,"O for God's sake! he growled. Listen to this! By God, you never hear me asking any one for anything, do you? he burst out in a rage.",1
854,"She took the shoes and gave them to Eugene. It would be a pity to throw away a good pair of shoes,"" she said. Try 'em on, boy. He tried them on.",1
855,"His feet were already bigger than Ben's. He walked about carefully and painfully a few steps. How do they feel?"" asked Eliza.",1
856,"All right, I guess,"" he said doubtfully. They're a little tight. He liked their clean strength, the good smell of leather.",1
857,"They were the best shoes he had ever had. Ben entered the kitchen. You little brute! he said. You've a foot like a mule. Scowling, he knelt and touched the straining leather at the toes. Eugene winced.",1
858,"Mama, for God's sake,"" Ben cried out irritably, ""don't make the kid wear them if they're too small. I'll buy him a pair myself if you're too stingy to spend the money. Why, what's wrong with these?"" said Eliza.",1
859,"She pressed them with her fingers. Why, pshaw! she said. There's nothing wrong with them. All shoes are a little tight at first. It won't hurt him a bit.",1
860,"But he had to give up at the end of six weeks. The hard leather did not stretch, his feet hurt more every day. He limped about more and more painfully until he planted each step woodenly as if he were walking on blocks. His feet were numb and dead, sore on the palms. One day, in a rage, Ben flung him down and took them off. It was several days before he began to walk with ease again. But his toes that had grown through boyhood straight and strong were pressed into a pulp, the bones gnarled, bent and twisted, the nails thick and dead.",1
861,"It does seem a pity to throw those good shoes away,"" sighed Eliza. But she had strange fits of generosity. He didn't understand.",1
862,"A girl came down to Altamont from the west. She was from Sevier, a mountain town, she said. She had a big brown body, and black hair and eyes of a Cherokee Indian.",1
863,"Mark my words,"" said Gant. That girl's got Cherokee blood in her somewhere. She took a room, and for days rocked back and forth in a chair before the parlor fire.",1
864,"She was shy, frightened, a little sullen-- her manners were country and decorous. She never spoke unless she was spoken to. Sometimes she was sick and stayed in bed. Eliza took her food then, and was extremely kind to her.",1
865,"Day after day the girl rocked back and forth, all through the stormy autumn. Eugene could hear her large feet as rhythmically they hit the floor, ceaselessly propelling the rocker. Her name was Mrs. Morgan.",1
866,"One day as he laid large crackling lumps upon the piled glowing mass of coals, Eliza entered the room. Mrs. Morgan rocked away stolidly. Eliza stood by the fire for a moment, pursing her lips reflectively, and folding her hands quietly upon her stomach. She looked out the window at the stormy sky, the swept windy bareness of the street.",1
867,"I tell you what,"" she said, ""it looks like a hard winter for the poor folks. Yes'm,"" said Mrs. Morgan sullenly. She kept on rocking.",1
868,Eliza was silent a moment longer. Where's your husband? she asked presently.,1
869,"In Sevier,"" Mrs. Morgan said. He's a railroad man. What's that, what's that?"" said Eliza quickly, comically.",1
870,"A railroad man, you say? she inquired sharply. Yes'm.""  ""Well, it looks mighty funny to me he hasn't been in to see you,"" said Eliza, with enormous accusing tranquillity.",1
871,I'd call it a pretty poor sort of man who'd act like that. Mrs. Morgan said nothing. Her tar-black eyes glittered in fireflame.,1
872,"Have you got any money?"" said Eliza. No'm,"" said Mrs. Morgan. Eliza stood solidly, enjoying the warmth, pursing her lips. When do you expect to have your baby?"" said Eliza suddenly.",1
873,"Mrs. Morgan said nothing for a moment. She kept on rocking. In less'n a month now, I reckon,"" she answered.",1
874,"She had been getting bigger week after week. Eliza bent over and pulled her skirt up, revealing her leg to the knee, cotton-stockinged and lumpily wadded over with her heavy flannels. Whew! she cried out coyly, noticing that Eugene was staring. Turn your head, boy,"" she commanded, snickering and rubbing her finger along her nose. The dull green of rolled banknotes shone through her stockings. She pulled the bills out.",1
875,"Well, I reckon you'll have to have a little money,"" said Eliza, peeling off two tens, and giving them to Mrs. Morgan. Thank you, ma'am,"" said Mrs. Morgan, taking the money. You can stay here until you're able to work again,"" said Eliza. I know a good doctor. Mama, in heaven's name,"" Helen fumed.",1
876,"Where on earth do you get these people? Merciful God! howled Gant, ""you've had 'em all--blind, lame, crazy, chippies and bastards. They all come here. Nevertheless, when he saw Mrs. Morgan now, he always made a profound bow, saying with the most florid courtesy:  ""How do you do, madam?""  Aside, to Helen, he said:  ""I tell you what--she's a fine-looking girl.",1
877,"Hahahaha,"" said Helen, laughing in an ironic falsetto, and prodding him, ""you wouldn't mind having her yourself, would you?""  ""B'God,"" he said humorously, wetting his thumb, and grinning slyly at Eliza, ""she's got a pair of pippins. Eliza smiled bitterly into popping grease. Hm! she said disdainfully. I don't care how many he goes with. There's no fool like an old fool. You'd better not be too smart. That's a game two can play at. Hahahahaha!"" laughed Helen thinly, ""she's mad now.",1
878,"Helen took Mrs. Morgan often to Gant's and cooked great meals for her. She also brought her presents of candy and scented soap from town. They called in McGuire at the birth of the child. From below Eugene heard the quiet commotion in the upstairs room, the low moans of the woman, and finally a high piercing wail. Eliza, greatly excited, kept kettles seething with hot water constantly over the gas flames of the stove. From time to time she rushed upstairs with a boiling kettle, descending a moment later more slowly, pausing from step to step while she listened attentively to the sounds in the room.",1
879,"After all,"" said Helen, banging kettles about restlessly in the kitchen, ""what do we know about her? Nobody can say she hasn't got a husband, can they? They'd better be careful! People have no right to say those things,"" she cried out irritably against unknown detractors.",1
880,"It was night. Eugene went out on to the veranda. The air was frosty, clear, not very cool. Above the black bulk of the eastern hills, and in the great bowl of the sky, far bright stars were scintillant as jewels. The light burned brightly in neighborhood houses, as bright and as hard as if carved from some cold gem. Across the wide yard-spaces wafted the warm odor of hamburger steak and fried onions. Ben stood at the veranda rail, leaning upon his cocked leg, smoking with deep lung inhalations. Eugene went over and stood by him. They heard the wail upstairs. Eugene snickered, looking up at the thin ivory mask. Ben lifted his white hand sharply to strike him, but dropped it with a growl of contempt, smiling faintly. Far before them, on the top of Birdseye, faint lights wavered in the rich Jew's castle. In the neighborhood there was a slight mist of supper, and frost-far voices.",1
881,"Deep womb, dark flower. The Hidden. The secret fruit, heart-red, fed by rich Indian blood. Womb-night brooding darkness flowering secretly into life.",1
882,"Mrs. Morgan went away two weeks after her child was born. He was a little brown-skinned boy, with a tuft of elvish black hair, and very black bright eyes. He was like a little Indian. Before she left Eliza gave her twenty dollars.",1
883,"Where are you going? she asked. I've got folks in Sevier,"" said Mrs. Morgan.",1
884,"She went up the street carrying a cheap imitation-crocodile valise. At her shoulder the baby waggled his head, and looked merrily back with his bright black eyes. Eliza waved to him and smiled tremulously; she turned back into the house sniffling, with wet eyes.",1
885,"Why did she come to Dixieland, I wonder? Eugene thought. Eliza was good to a little man with a mustache. He had a wife and a little girl nine years old. He was a hotel steward; he was out of work and he stayed at Dixieland until he owed her more than one hundred dollars. But he split kindling neatly, and carried up coal; he did handy jobs of carpentry, and painted up rusty places about the house.",1
886,"She was very fond of him; he was what she called ""a good family man. She liked domestic people; she liked men who were house- broken. The little man was very kind and very tame. Eugene liked him because he made good coffee. Eliza never bothered him about the money. Finally, he got work at the Inn, and quarters there. He paid Eliza all he owed her.",1
887,"Eugene stayed late at the school, returning in the afternoon at three or four o'clock. Sometimes it was almost dark when he came back to Dixieland. Eliza was fretful at his absences, and brought him his dinner crisped and dried from its long heating in the oven. There was a heavy vegetable soup thickly glutinous with cabbage, beans, and tomatoes, and covered on top with big grease blisters. There would also be warmed-over beef, pork or chicken, a dish full of cold lima beans, biscuits, slaw, and coffee.",1
888,"But the school had become the centre of his heart and life-- Margaret Leonard his spiritual mother. He liked to be there most in the afternoons when the crowd of boys had gone, and when he was free to wander about the old house, under the singing majesty of great trees, exultant in the proud solitude of that fine hill, the clean windy rain of the acorns, the tang of burning leaves. He would read wolfishly until Margaret discovered him and drove him out under the trees or toward the flat court behind Bishop Raper's residence at the entrance, which was used for basketball. Here, while the western sky reddened, he raced down toward the goal, passing the ball to a companion, exulting in his growing swiftness, agility, and expertness in shooting the basket.",1
889,"Margaret Leonard watched his health jealously, almost morbidly, warning him constantly of the terrible consequences that followed physical depletion, the years required to build back what had once been thrown carelessly away. Look here, boy! she would begin, stopping him in a quiet boding voice. Come in here a minute. I want to talk to you. Somewhat frightened, extremely nervous, he would sit down beside her.",1
890,"How much sleep have you been getting? she asked. Hopefully, he said nine hours a night. That should be about right.",1
891,"Well, make it ten,"" she commanded sternly. See here, 'Gene, you simply can't afford to take chances with your health. Lordy, boy, I know what I'm talking about. I've had to pay the price, I tell you. You can't do anything in this world without your health, boy. But I'm all right,"" he protested desperately, frightened.",1
892,"There's nothing wrong with me. You're not strong, boy. You've got to get some meat on your bones. I tell you what, I'm worried by those circles under your eyes. Do you keep regular hours? He did not: he hated regular hours.",1
893,"The excitement, the movement, the constant moments of crisis at Gant's and Eliza's had him keyed to their stimulation. The order and convention of domestic life he had never known. He was desperately afraid of regularity. It meant dullness and inanition to him. He loved the hour of midnight.",1
894,"But obediently he promised her that he would be regular--regular in eating, sleeping, studying, and exercising. But he had not yet learned to play with the crowd. He still feared, disliked and distrusted them.",1
895,"He shrank from the physical conflict of boy life, but knowing her eye was upon him he plunged desperately into their games, his frail strength buffeted in the rush of strong legs, the heavy jar of strong bodies, picking himself up bruised and sore at heart to follow and join again the mill of the burly pack. Day after day to the ache of his body was added the ache and shame of his spirit, but he hung on with a pallid smile across his lips, and envy and fear of their strength in his heart. He parroted faithfully all that John Dorsey had to say about the ""spirit of fair play,"" ""sportsmanship,"" ""playing the game for the game's sake,"" ""accepting defeat or victory with a smile,"" and so on, but he had no genuine belief or understanding. These phrases were current among all the boys at the school--they had been made somewhat too conscious of them and, as he listened, at times the old, inexplicable shame returned--he craned his neck and drew one foot sharply off the ground.",1
896,"And Eugene noted, with the old baffling shame again, as this cheap tableau of self-conscious, robust, and raucously aggressive boyhood was posed, that, for all the mouthing of phrases, the jargon about fair play and sportsmanship, the weaker, at Leonard's, was the legitimate prey of the stronger. Leonard, beaten by a boy in a play of wits, or in an argument for justice, would assert the righteousness of his cause by physical violence. These spectacles were ugly and revolting: Eugene watched them with sick fascination.",1
897,"Leonard himself was not a bad man--he was a man of considerable character, kindliness, and honest determination. He loved his family, he stood up with some courage against the bigotry in the Methodist church, where he was a deacon, and at length had to withdraw because of his remarks on Darwin's theory. He was, thus, an example of that sad liberalism of the village--an advanced thinker among the Methodists, a bearer of the torch at noon, an apologist for the toleration of ideas that have been established for fifty years. He tried faithfully to do his duties as a teacher. But he was of the earth--even his heavy-handed violence was of the earth, and had in it the unconscious brutality of nature. Although he asserted his interest in ""the things of the mind,"" his interest in the soil was much greater, and he had added little to his stock of information since leaving college. He was slow-witted and quite lacking in the sensitive intuitions of Margaret, who loved the man with such passionate fidelity, however, that she seconded all his acts before the world. Eugene had even heard her cry out in a shrill, trembling voice against a student who had answered her husband insolently:  ""Why, I'd slap his head off! That's what I'd do! And the boy had trembled, with fear and nausea, to see her so. But thus, he knew, could love change one. Leonard thought his actions wise and good: he had grown up in a tradition that demanded strict obedience to the master, and that would not brook opposition to his rulings. He had learned from his father, a Tennessee patriarch who ran a farm, preached on Sundays, and put down rebellion in his family with a horse-whip and pious prayers, the advantages of being God! He thought little boys who resisted him should be beaten.",1
898,"Upon the sons of his wealthiest and most prominent clients, as well as upon his own children, Leonard was careful to inflict no chastisement, and these young men, arrogantly conscious of their immunity, were studious in their insolence and disobedience. The son of the Bishop, Justin Raper, a tall thin boy of thirteen, with black hair, a thin dark bumpy face, and absurdly petulant lips, typed copies of a dirty ballad and sold them among the students at five cents a copy. Madam, your daughter looks very fine,       Slapoon! Madam, your daughter looks very fine,       Slapoon!",1
899,"Moreover, Leonard surprised this youth one afternoon in Spring on the eastern flank of the hill, in the thick grass beneath a flowering dogwood, united in sexual congress with Miss Hazel Bradley, the daughter of a small grocer who lived below on Biltburn Avenue, and whose lewdness was already advertised in the town. Leonard, on second thought, did not go to the Bishop. He went to the Grocer.",1
900,"Well,"" said Mr. Bradley, brushing his long mustache reflectively away from his mouth, ""you ought to put up a no-trespassin' sign. The target of concentrated abuse, both for John Dorsey and the boys, was the son of a Jew. The boy's name was Edward Michalove. His father was a jeweller, a man with a dark, gentle floridity of manner and complexion. He had white delicate fingers. His counters were filled with old brooches, gemmed buckles, ancient incrusted watches. The boy had two sisters--large handsome women. His mother was dead. None of them looked Jewish: they all had a soft dark fluescence of appearance.",1
901,"At twelve, he was a tall slender lad, with dark amber features, and the mincing effeminacy of an old maid. He was terrified in the company of other boys, all that was sharp, spinsterly, and venomous, would come protectively to the surface when he was ridiculed or threatened, and he would burst into shrill unpleasant laughter, or hysterical tears. His mincing walk, with the constant gesture of catching maidenly at the fringe of his coat as he walked along, his high husky voice, with a voluptuous and feminine current playing through it, drew upon him at once the terrible battery of their dislike.",1
902,"They called him ""Miss"" Michalove; they badgered him into a state of constant hysteria, until he became an unpleasant snarling little cat, holding up his small clawed hands to scratch them with his long nails whenever they approached; they made him detestable, master and boys alike, and they hated him for what they made of him. Sobbing one day when he had been kept in after school hours, he leaped up and rushed suddenly for the doors. Leonard, breathing stertorously, pounded awkwardly after him, and returned in a moment dragging the screaming boy along by the collar.",1
903,"Sit down! yelled John Dorsey, hurling him into a desk. Then, his boiling fury unappeased, and baffled by fear of inflicting some crippling punishment on the boy, he added illogically:  ""Stand up!"" and jerked him to his feet again.",1
904,"You young upstart! he panted. You little two-by-two whippersnapper! We'll just see, my sonny, if I'm to be dictated to by the like of you. Take your hands off me!",1
905,"Edward screamed, in an agony of physical loathing. I'll tell my father on you, old man Leonard, and he'll come down here and kick your big fat behind all over the lot. See if he don't. Eugene closed his eyes, unable to witness the snuffing out of a young life.",1
906,"He was cold and sick about his heart. But when he opened his eyes again Edward, flushed and sobbing, was standing where he stood. Nothing had happened.",1
907,"Eugene waited for God's visitation upon the unhappy blasphemer. He gathered, from the slightly open paralysis that had frozen John Dorsey's and Sister Amy's face, that they were waiting too. Edward lived. There was nothing beyond this--nothing.",1
908,"Eugene thought of this young Jew years later with the old piercing shame, with the riving pain by which a man recalls the irrevocable moment of some cowardly or dishonorable act. For not only did he join in the persecution of the boy--he was also glad at heart because of the existence of some one weaker than himself, some one at whom the flood of ridicule might be directed. Years later it came to him that on the narrow shoulders of that Jew lay a burden he might otherwise have borne, that that overladen heart was swollen with a misery that might have been his.",1
909,"Mr. Leonard's ""men of to-morrow"" were doing nicely. The spirit of justice, of physical honor was almost unknown to them, but they were loud in proclaiming the letter. Each of them lived in a fear of discovery; each of them who was able built up his own defenses of swagger, pretense, and loud assertion--the great masculine flower of gentleness, courage, and honor died in a foul tangle. The great clan of go-getter was emergent in young boys--big in voice, violent in threat, withered and pale at heart--the ""He-men"" were on the rails.",1
910,"And Eugene, encysted now completely behind the walls of his fantasy, hurled his physical body daily to defeat, imitated, as best he could, the speech, gesture, and bearing of his fellows, joined, by act or spirit, in the attack on those weaker than himself, and was compensated sometimes for his bruises when he heard Margaret say that he was ""a boy with a fine spirit. She said it very often. He was, fortunately, thanks to Gant and Eliza, a creature that was dominantly masculine in its sex, but in all his life, either at home or in school, he had seldom known victory. Fear he knew well. And so incessant, it seemed to him later, had been this tyranny of strength, that in his young wild twenties when his great boneframe was powerfully fleshed at last, and he heard about him the loud voices, the violent assertion, the empty threat, memory would waken in him a maniacal anger, and he would hurl the insolent intruding swaggerer from his path, thrust back the jostler, glare insanely into fearful surprised faces and curse them.",1
911,"He never forgot the Jew; he always thought of him with shame. But it was many years before he could understand that that sensitive and feminine person, bound to him by the secret and terrible bonds of his own dishonor, had in him nothing perverse, nothing unnatural, nothing degenerate. He was as much like a woman as a man. That was all. There is no place among the Boy Scouts for the androgyne--it must go to Parnassus.",1
912,"18   In the years that had followed Eliza's removal to Dixieland, by a slow inexorable chemistry of union and repellence, profound changes had occurred in the alignment of the Gants. Eugene had passed away from Helen's earlier guardianship into the keeping of Ben. This separation was inevitable. The great affection she had shown him when he was a young child was based not on any deep kinship of mind or body or spirit, but on her vast maternal feeling, something that poured from her in a cataract of tenderness and cruelty upon young, weak, plastic life.",1
913,"The time had passed when she could tousle him on the bed in a smother of slaps and kisses, crushing him, stroking him, biting and kissing his young flesh. He was not so attractive physically--he had lost the round contours of infancy, he had grown up like a weed, his limbs were long and gangling, his feet large, his shoulders bony, and his head too big and heavy for the scrawny neck on which it sagged forward. Moreover, he sank deeper year by year into the secret life, a strange wild thing bloomed darkly in his face, and when she spoke to him his eyes were filled with the shadows of great ships and cities.",1
914,"And this secret life, which she could never touch, and which she could never understand, choked her with fury. It was necessary for her to seize life in her big red-knuckled hands, to cuff and caress it, to fondle, love, and enslave it. Her boiling energy rushed outward on all things that lived in the touch of the sun. It was necessary for her to dominate and enslave, all her virtues--her strong lust to serve, to give, to nurse, to amuse--came from the imperative need for dominance over almost all she touched.",1
915,"She was herself ungovernable; she disliked whatever did not yield to her governance. In his loneliness he would have yielded his spirit into bondage willingly if in exchange he might have had her love which so strangely he had forfeited, but he was unable to reveal to her the flowering ecstasies, the dark and incommunicable fantasies in which his life was bound. She hated secrecy; an air of mystery, a crafty but knowing reticence, or the unfathomable depths of other-wordliness goaded her to fury.",1
916,"Convulsed by a momentary rush of hatred, she would caricature the pout of his lips, the droop of his head, his bounding kangaroo walk. You little freak. You nasty little freak. You don't even know who you are--you little bastard. You're not a Gant. Any one can see that. You haven't a drop of papa's blood in you. Queer one! Queer one! You're Greeley Pentland all over again. She always returned to this--she was fanatically partisan, her hysterical superstition had already lined the family in embattled groups of those who were Gant and those who were Pentland.",1
917,"On the Pentland side, she placed Steve, Daisy, and Eugene--they were, she thought, the ""cold and selfish ones,"" and the implication of the older sister and the younger brother with the criminal member of the family gave her an added pleasure. Her union with Luke was now inseparable. It had been inevitable. They were the Gants--those who were generous, fine, and honorable.",1
918,"The love of Luke and Helen was epic. They found in each other the constant effervescence, the boundless extraversion, the richness, the loudness, the desperate need to give and to serve that was life to them. They exacerbated the nerves of each other, but their love was beyond grievance, and their songs of praise were extravagant.",1
919,"I'll criticise him if I like,"" she said pugnaciously. I've got the right to. But I won't hear any one else criticise him. He's a fine generous boy--the finest one in this family. That's one thing sure. Ben alone seemed to be without the grouping.",1
920,"He moved among them like a shadow--he was remote from their passionate fullblooded partisanship. But she thought of him as ""generous""--he was, she concluded, a ""Gant. In spite of this violent dislike for the Pentlands, both Helen and Luke had inherited all Gant's social hypocrisy. They wanted above all else to put a good face on before the world, to be well liked and to have many friends. They were profuse in their thanks, extravagant in their praise, cloying in their flattery. They slathered it on. They kept their ill-temper, their nervousness, and their irritability for exhibition at home. And in the presence of any members of Jim or Will Pentland's family their manner was not only friendly, it was even touched slightly with servility. Money impressed them.",1
921,"It was a period of incessant movement in the family. Steve had married a year or two before a woman from a small town in lower Indiana. She was thirty-seven years old, twelve years his senior, a squat heavy German with a big nose and a patient and ugly face. She had come to Dixieland one summer with another woman, a spinster of lifelong acquaintance, and allowed him to seduce her before she left. The winter following, her father, a small manufacturer of cigars, had died, leaving her $9,000 in insurance, his home, a small sum of money in the bank, and a quarter share in his business, which was left to the management of his two sons.",1
922,"Early in Spring the woman, whose name was Margaret Lutz, returned to Dixieland. One drowsy afternoon Eugene found them at Gant's. The house was deserted save for them. They were sprawled out face downward, with their hands across each other's hips, on Gant's bed. They lay there silently, while he looked, in an ugly stupor. Steve's yellow odor filled the room. Eugene began to tremble with insane fury. The Spring was warm and lovely, the air brooded slightly in a flowering breeze, there was a smell of soft tar. He had come down to the empty house exultantly, tasting its delicious silence, the cool mustiness of indoors, and a solitary afternoon with great calf volumes. In a moment the world turned hag.",1
923,"There was nothing that Steve touched that he did not taint. Eugene hated him because he stunk, because all that he touched stunk, because he brought fear, shame, and loathing wherever he went; because his kisses were fouler than his curses, his whines nastier than his threats. He saw the woman's hair blown gently by the blubbered exhalations of his brother's foul breath.",1
924,"What are you doing there on papa's bed?"" he screamed. Steve rose stupidly and seized him by the arm. The woman sat up, dopily staring, her short legs widened.",1
925,"I suppose you're going to be a little Tattle-tale,"" said Steve, bludgeoning him with heavy contempt. You're going to run right up and tell mama, aren't you?"" he said. He fastened his yellow fingers on Eugene's arm.",1
926,"Get off papa's bed,"" said Eugene desperately. He jerked his arm away. You're not going to tell on us, buddy, are you? Steve wheedled, breathing pollution in his face.",1
927,"He grew sick. Let me go,"" he muttered. No.""  Steve and Margaret were married soon after.",1
928,"With the old sense of physical shame Eugene watched them descend the stairs at Dixieland each morning for breakfast. Steve swaggered absurdly, smiled complacently, and hinted at great fortune about the town. There was rumor of a quarter-million.",1
929,"Put it there, Steve,"" said Harry Tugman, slapping him powerfully upon the shoulder. By God, I always said you'd get there. Eliza smiled at swagger and boast, her proud, pleased, tremulous sad smile.",1
930,"The first-born. Little Stevie doesn't have to worry any longer,"" said he. He's on Easy Street. Where are all the Wise Guys now who said 'I told you so'? They're all mighty glad to give Little Stevie a Big Smile and the Glad Hand when he breezes down the street. Every Knocker is a Booster now all right, all right. I tell you what,"" said Eliza with proud smiles, ""he's no fool.",1
931,"He's as bright as the next one when he wants to be. Brighter, she thought. Steve bought new clothes, tan shoes, striped silk shirts, and a wide straw hat with a red, white and blue band. He swung his shoulders in a wide arc as he walked, snapped his fingers nonchalantly, and smiled with elaborate condescension on those who greeted him. Helen was vastly annoyed and amused; she had to laugh at his absurd strut, and she had a great rush of feeling for Margaret Lutz. She called her ""honey,"" felt her eyes mist warmly with unaccountable tears as she looked into the patient, bewildered, and slightly frightened face of the German woman. She took her in her arms and fondled her.",1
932,"That's all right, honey,"" she said, ""you let us know if he doesn't treat you right. We'll fix him. Steve's a good boy,"" said Margaret, ""when he isn't drinking.",1
933,"I've nothing to say against him when he's sober. She burst into tears. That awful, that awful curse,"" said Eliza, shaking her head sadly, ""the curse of licker. It's been responsible for the ruination of more homes than anything else. Well, she'll never win any beauty prizes, that's one thing sure,"" said Helen privately to Eliza.",1
934,"I'll vow!"" said Eliza. What on earth did he mean by doing such a thing! she continued. She's ten years older than he if she's a day. I think he's done pretty well, if you ask me,"" said Helen, annoyed.",1
935,"Good heavens, mama! You talk as if he's some sort of prize. Every one in town knows what Steve is. She laughed ironically and angrily. No, indeed! He got the best of the bargain. Margaret's a decent girl. Well,"" said Eliza hopefully, ""maybe he's going to brace up now and make a new start.",1
936,"He's promised that he'd try. Well, I should hope so,"" said Helen scathingly. I should hope so. It's about time. Her dislike for him was innate.",1
937,"She had placed him among the tribe of the Pentlands. But he was really more like Gant than any one else. He was like Gant in all his weakness, with none of his cleanliness, his lean fibre, his remorse. In her heart she knew this and it increased her dislike for him. She shared in the fierce antagonism Gant felt toward his son. But her feeling was broken, as was all her feeling, by moments of friendliness, charity, tolerance.",1
938,"What are you going to do, Steve?"" she asked. You've got a family now, you know. Little Stevie doesn't have to worry any longer,"" he said, smiling easily.",1
939,"He lets the others do the worrying. He lifted his yellow fingers to his mouth, drawing deeply at a cigarette. Good heavens, Steve,"" she burst out angrily. Pull yourself together and try to be a man for once. Margaret's a woman. You surely don't expect her to keep you up, do you?""  ""What business is that of yours, for Christ's sake?"" he said in a high ugly voice.",1
940,"Nobody's asked your advice, have they? All of you are against me. None of you had a good word for me when I was down and out, and now it gets your goat to see me make good. He had believed for years that he was persecuted--his failure at home he attributed to the malice, envy, and disloyalty of his family, his failure abroad to the malice and envy of an opposing force that he called ""the world. No,"" he said, taking another long puff at the moist cigarette, ""don't worry about Stevie.",1
941,"He doesn't need anything from any of you, and you don't hear him asking for anything. You see that, don't you?"" he said, pulling a roll of banknotes from his pocket and peeling off a few twenties. Well, there's lots more where that came from. And I'll tell you something else: Little Stevie will be right up there among the Big Boys soon. He's got a couple of deals coming off that'll show the pikers in this town where to get off. You get that, don't you?"" he said.",1
942,"Ben, who had been sitting on the piano stool all this time, scowling savagely at the keys, and humming a little recurrent tune to himself while he picked it out with one finger, turned now to Helen, with a sharp flicker of his mouth, and jerked his head sideways. I hear Mr. Vanderbilt's getting jealous,"" he said. Helen laughed ironically, huskily.",1
943,"You think you're a pretty wise guy, don't you?"" said Steve heavily. But I don't notice it's getting you anywhere. Ben turned his scowling eyes upon him, and sniffed sharply, unconsciously.",1
944,"Now, I hope you're not going to forget your old friends, Mr. Rockefeller,"" he said in his subdued, caressing ominous voice. I'd like to be vice-president if the job's still open. He turned back to the keyboard--and searched with a hooked finger.",1
945,"All right, all right,"" said Steve. Go ahead and laugh, both of you, if you think it's funny. But you notice that Little Stevie isn't a fifteen-dollar clerk in a newspaper office, don't you? And he doesn't have to sing in moving-picture shows, either,"" he added.",1
946,"Helen's big-boned face reddened angrily. She had begun to sing in public with the saddlemaker's daughter. You'd better not talk, Steve, until you get a job and quit bumming around,"" she said. You're a fine one to talk, hanging around pool-rooms and drug-stores all day on your wife's money. Why, it's absurd! she said furiously.",1
947,"Oh for God's sake! Ben cried irritably, wheeling around. What do you want to listen to him for? Can't you see he's crazy?""  As the summer lengthened, Steve began to drink heavily again.",1
948,"His decayed teeth, neglected for years, began to ache simultaneously: he was wild with pain and cheap whisky. He felt that Eliza and Margaret were in some way responsible for his woe--he sought them out day after day when they were alone, and screamed at them. He called them foul names and said they had poisoned his system.",1
949,"In the early hours of morning, at two or three o'clock, he would waken, and walk through the house weeping and entreating release. Eliza would send him to Spaugh at the hotel or to McGuire, at his residence, in Eugene's charge. The doctors, surly and half-awake, peeled back his shirtsleeve and drove a needle with morphine deep in his upper arm. After that, he found relief and sleep again.",1
950,"One night, at the supper hour, he returned to Dixieland, holding his tortured jaws between his hands. He found Eliza bending over the spitting grease of the red-hot stove. He cursed her for bearing him, he cursed her for allowing him to have teeth, he cursed her for lack of sympathy, motherly love, human kindliness.",1
951,"Her white face worked silently above the heat. Get out of here,"" she said. You don't know what you're talking about. It's that accursed licker that makes you so mean. She began to weep, brushing at her broad red nose with her hand.",1
952,"I never thought I'd live to hear such talk from a son of mine,"" she said. She held out her forefinger with the old powerful gesture. Now, I want to tell you,"" she said, ""I'm not going to put up with you any longer. If you don't get out of here at once I'm going to call 38 and let them take you. This was the police station. It awoke unpleasant memories. He had spent the day in jail on two similar occasions. He became more violent than before, screamed a vile name at her, and made a motion to strike her. At this moment, Luke entered; he was on his way to Gant's.",1
953,"The antagonism between the boy and his older brother was deep and deadly. It had lasted for years. Now, trembling with anger, Luke came to his mother's defense.",1
954,"You m-m-m-miserable d-d-degenerate,"" he stuttered, unconsciously falling into the swing of the Gantian rhetoric. You ought to b-b- b-be horsewhipped. He was a well grown and muscular young fellow of nineteen years, but too sensitive to all the taboos of brotherhood to be prepared for the attack Steve made on him.",1
955,"Steve drove at him viciously, smashing drunkenly at his face with both hands. He was driven gasping and blinded across the kitchen. Wrong forever on the throne.",1
956,"Somewhere, through fear and fury, Eugene heard Ben's voice humming unconcernedly, and the slow picked tune on the piano. Ben!"" he screamed, dancing about and grasping a hammer. Ben entered like a cat. Luke was bleeding warmly from the nose.",1
957,"Come on, come on, you big bastard,"" said Steve, exalted by his success, throwing himself into a fancy boxing posture. I'll take you on now. You haven't got a chance, Ben,"" he continued, with elaborate pity. You haven't got a chance, boy. I'll tear your head off with what I know. Ben scowled quietly at him for a moment while he pranced softly about, proposing his fists in Police Gazette attitudes.",1
958,"Then, exploding suddenly in maniacal anger, the quiet one sprang upon the amateur pugilist with one bound, and flattened him with a single blow of his fist. Steve's head bounced upon the floor in a most comforting fashion. Eugene gave a loud shriek of ecstasy and danced about, insane with joy, while Ben, making little snarling noises in his throat, leaped on his brother's prostrate body and thumped his bruised skull upon the boards. There was a beautiful thoroughness about his wakened anger--it never made inquiries till later.",1
959,"Good old Ben,"" screamed Eugene, howling with insane laughter. Good old Ben.""  Eliza, who had been calling out loudly for help, the police, and the interference of the general public, now succeeded, with Luke's assistance, in checking Ben's assault, and pulling him up from his dazed victim. She wept bitterly, her heart laden with pain and sadness, while Luke, forgetful of his bloody nose, sorrowful and full of shame only because brother had struck brother, assisted Steve to his feet and brushed him off.",1
960,"A terrible shame started up in each of them--they were unable to meet one another's gaze. Ben's thin face was very white; he trembled violently and, catching sight of Steve's bleared eyes for a moment, he made a retching noise in his throat, went over to the sink, and drank a glass of cold water. A house divided against itself cannot stand,"" Eliza wept.",1
961,"Helen came in from town with a bag of warm bread and cakes. What's the matter?"" she said, noting at once all that had happened. I don't know,"" said Eliza, her face working, shaking her head for several moments before she spoke. It seems that the judgment of God is against us. There's been nothing but misery all my life. All I want is a little peace. She wept softly, wiping her weak bleared eyes with the back of her hand.",1
962,"Well, forget about it,"" said Helen quietly. Her voice was casual, weary, sad. How do you feel, Steve?"" she asked.",1
963,"I wouldn't make any trouble for any one, Helen,"" he said, with a maudlin whimper. No!  No!"" he continued in a brooding voice. They've never given Steve a chance. They're all down on him. They jumped on me, Helen. My own brothers jumped on me, sick as I am, and beat me up. It's all right. I'm going away somewhere and try to forget. Stevie doesn't hold any grudge against any one. He's not built that way. Give me your hand, buddy,"" he said, turning to Ben with nauseous sentimentality and extending his yellow fingers, ""I'm willing to shake your hand. You hit me to- night, but Steve's willing to forget. Oh my God,"" said Ben, grasping his stomach.",1
964,"He leaned weakly across the sink and drank another glass of water. No.  No.""  Steve began again. Stevie isn't built--""  He would have continued indefinitely in this strain, but Helen checked him with weary finality.",1
965,"Well, forget about it,"" she said, ""all of you. Life's too short. Life was.",1
966,"At these moments, after battle, after all the confusion, antagonism, and disorder of their lives had exploded in a moment of strife, they gained an hour of repose in which they saw themselves with sad tranquillity. They were like men who, driving forward desperately at some mirage, turn, for a moment, to see their footprints stretching interminably away across the waste land of the desert; or I should say, they were like those who have been mad, and who will be mad again, but who see themselves for a moment quietly, sanely, at morning, looking with sad untroubled eyes into a mirror. Their faces were sad. There was great age in them. They felt suddenly the distance they had come and the amount they had lived. They had a moment of cohesion, a moment of tragic affection and union, which drew them together like small jets of flame against all the senseless nihilism of life.",1
967,"Margaret came in fearfully. Her eyes were red, her broad German face white and tearful. A group of excited boarders whispered in the hall.",1
968,"I'll lose them all now,"" Eliza fretted. The last time three left. Over twenty dollars a week and money so hard to get. I don't know what's to become of us all. She wept again.",1
969,"Oh, for heaven's sake,"" said Helen impatiently. Forget about the boarders once in a while. Steve sank stupidly into a chair by the long table.",1
970,"From time to time he muttered sentimentally to himself. Luke, his face sensitive, hurt, ashamed around his mouth, stood by him attentively, spoke gently to him, and brought him a glass of water. Give him a cup of coffee, mama,"" Helen cried irritably. For heaven's sake, you might do a little for him. Why here, here,"" said Eliza, rushing awkwardly to the gas range and lighting a burner.",1
971,"I never thought--I'll have some in a minute. Margaret sat in a chair on the other side of the disorderly table, leaning her face in her hand and weeping. Her tears dredged little gulches through the thick compost of rouge and powder with which she coated her rough skin.",1
972,"Cheer up, honey,"" said Helen, beginning to laugh. Christmas is coming. She patted the broad German back comfortingly.",1
973,"Ben opened the torn screen door and stepped out on the back porch. It was a cool night in the rich month of August; the sky was deeply pricked with great stars. He lighted a cigarette, holding the match with white trembling fingers. There were faint sounds from summer porches, the laughter of women, a distant throb of music at a dance. Eugene went and stood beside him: he looked up at him with wonder, exultancy, and with sadness. He prodded him half with fear, half with joy.",1
974,"Ben snarled softly at him, made a sudden motion to strike him, but stopped. A swift light flickered across his mouth. He smoked.",1
975,"Steve went away with the German woman to Indiana, where, at first, came news of opulence, fatness, ease, and furs (with photographs), later of brawls with her honest brothers, and talk of divorce, reunion and renascence. He gravitated between the two poles of his support, Margaret and Eliza, returning to Altamont every summer for a period of drugs and drunkenness that ended in a family fight, jail, and a hospital cure. Hell commences,"" howled Gant, ""as soon as he comes home. He's a curse and a care, the lowest of the low, the vilest of the vile. Woman, you have given birth to a monster who will not rest until he has done me to death, fearful, cruel, and accursed reprobate that he is!",1
976,"But Eliza wrote her oldest son regularly, enclosed sums of money from time to time, and revived her hopes incessantly, against nature, against reason, against the structure of life. She did not dare to come openly to his defense, to reveal frankly the place he held in her heart's core, but she would produce each letter in which he spoke boastfully of his successes, or announced his monthly resurrection, and read them to an unmoved family. They were florid, foolish letters, full of quotation marks and written in a large fancy hand. She was proud and pleased at all their extravagances; his flowery illiteracy was another proof to her of his superior intelligence.",1
977,"Dear Mama:  Yours of the 11th to hand and must say I was glad to know you were in ""the land of the living"" again as I had begun to feel it was a ""long time between drinks"" since your last. (""I tell you what,"" said Eliza, looking up and sniggering with pleasure, ""he's no fool. Helen, with a smile that was half ribald, half annoyed, about her big mouth, made a face at Luke, and lifted her eyes patiently upward to God as Eliza continued. Gant leaned forward tensely with his head craned upward, listening carefully with a faint grin of pleasure.) Well, mama, since I last wrote you things have been coming my way and it now looks as if the ""Prodigal Son"" will come home some day in his own private car. (""Hey, what's that?"" said Gant, and she read it again for him. He wet his thumb and looked about with a pleased grin. Wh-wh-what's the matter?"" asked Luke. Has he b-b-bought the railroad? Helen laughed hoarsely. I'm from Missouri,"" she said.) It took me a long time to get started, mama, but things were breaking against me and all that little Stevie has ever asked from any one in this ""vale of tears"" is a fair chance. (Helen laughed her ironical husky falsetto. All that little S-S-Stevie has ever asked,"" said Luke, reddening with annoyance, ""is the whole g-g-g-goddam world with a few gold mines thrown in."") But now that I'm on my feet at last, mama, I'm going to show the world that I haven't forgotten those who stood by me in my ""hour of need,"" and that the best friend a man ever had is his mother. (""Where's the shovel?"" said Ben, snickering quietly.)",1
978,"'That boy writes a good letter,"" said Gant appreciatively. I'm damned if he's not the smartest one of the lot when he wants to be. Yes,"" said Luke angrily, ""he's so smart that you'll b-b-be-lieve any fairy tale he wants to tell you.",1
979,"B-b-b-but the one who's stuck by you through thick and thin gets no c-c-credit at all. He glanced meaningly at Helen. It's a d-d-damn shame. Forget about it,"" she said wearily.",1
980,"Well,"" said Eliza thoughtfully, holding the letter in her folded hands and gazing away, ""perhaps he's going to turn over a new leaf now. You never know. Lost in pleased revery she looked into vacancy, pursing her lips.",1
981,"I hope so!"" said Helen wearily. You've got to show me. Privately:  ""You see how it is, don't you?",1
982,"she said to Luke, mounting to hysteria. Do I get any credit? Do I? I can work my fingers to the bone for them, but do I get so much as Go to Hell for my trouble? Do I?""    In these years Helen went off into the South with Pearl Hines, the saddlemaker's daughter.",1
983,"They sang together at moving-picture theatres in country towns. They were booked from a theatrical office in Atlanta. Pearl Hines was a heavily built girl with a meaty face and negroid lips. She was jolly and vital. She sang ragtime and nigger songs with a natural passion, swinging her hips and shaking her breasts erotically.",1
984,"Here comes my da-dad-dy now       O pop, O pop, O-o pop. They earned as much as $100 a week sometimes. They played in towns like Waycross, Georgia; Greenville, South Carolina; Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.",1
985,"They brought with them the great armor of innocency. They were eager and decent girls. Occasionally the village men made cautious explorative insults, relying on the superstition that lives in small towns concerning ""show girls. But generally they were well treated.",1
986,"For them, these ventures into new lands were eager with promise. The vacant idiot laughter, the ribald enthusiasm with which South Carolina or Georgia countrymen, filling a theatre with the strong smell of clay and sweat, greeted Pearl's songs, left them unwounded, pleased, eager. They were excited to know that they were members of the profession; they bought Variety regularly, they saw themselves finally a celebrated high-salaried team on ""big time"" in great cities. Pearl was to ""put over"" the popular songs, to introduce the rag melodies with the vital rhythm of her dynamic meatiness, Helen was to give operatic dignity to the programme. In a respectful hush, bathed in a pink spot, she sang ditties of higher quality--Tosti's ""Goodbye,"" ""The End of a Perfect Day,"" and ""The Rosary. She had a big, full, somewhat metallic voice: she had received training from her Aunt Louise, the splendid blonde who had lived in Altamont for several years after her separation from Elmer Pentland. Louise gave music lessons and enjoyed her waning youth with handsome young men. She was one of the ripe, rich, dangerous women that Helen liked. She had a little girl and went away to New York with the child when tongues grew fanged.",1
987,"But she said:  ""Helen, that voice ought to be trained for grand opera. Helen had not forgotten. She fantasied of France and Italy: the big crude glare of what she called ""a career in opera,"" the florid music, the tiered galleries winking with gems, the torrential applause directed toward the full-blooded, dominant all-shadowing songsters struck up great anthems in her. It was a scene, she thought, in which she was meant to shine. And as the team of Gant and Hines (The Dixie Melody Twins) moved on their jagged circuit through the South, this desire, bright, fierce, and formless, seemed, in some way, to be nearer realization.",1
988,"She wrote home frequently, usually to Gant. Her letters beat like great pulses; they were filled with the excitement of new cities, presentiments of abundant life. In every town they met ""lovely people""--everywhere, in fact, good wives and mothers, and nice young men, were attracted hospitably to these two decent, happy, exciting girls. There was a vast decency, an enormous clean vitality about Helen that subjugated good people and defeated bad ones. She held under her dominion a score of young men--masculine, red-faced, hard-drinking and shy. Her relation to them was maternal and magistral, they came to listen and to be ruled; they adored her, but few of them tried to kiss her.",1
989,"Eugene was puzzled and frightened by these lamb-like lions. Among men, they were fierce, bold, and combative; with her, awkward and timorous. One of them, a city surveyor, lean, highboned, alcoholic, was constantly involved in police-court brawls; another, a railroad detective, a large fair young man, split the skulls of negroes when he was drunk, shot several men, and was himself finally killed in a Tennessee gun-fight.",1
990,"She never lacked for friends and protectors wherever she went. Occasionally, Pearl's happy and vital sensuality, the innocent gusto with which she implored        ""Some sweet old daddy       Come make a fuss over me. drew on village rakedom to false conjectures.",1
991,"Unpleasant men with wet cigars would ask them to have a convivial drink of corn whisky, call them ""girley,"" and suggest a hotel room or a motorcar as a meeting-place. When this happened, Pearl was stricken into silence; helpless and abashed, she appealed to Helen. And she, her large loose mouth tense and wounded at the corners, her eyes a little brighter, would answer:  ""I don't know what you mean by that remark.",1
992,"I guess you've made a mistake about us. This did not fail to exact stammering apologies and excuses. She was painfully innocent, temperamentally incapable of wholly believing the worst about any one. She lived in the excitement of rumor and suggestion: it never seemed to her actually possible that the fast young women who excited her had, in the phrase she used, ""gone the limit. She was skilled in gossip, and greedily attentive to it, but of the complex nastiness of village life she had little actual knowledge. Thus, with Pearl Hines, she walked confidently and joyously over volcanic crust, scenting only the odor of freedom, change, and adventure.",1
993,"But this partnership came to an end. The intention of Pearl Hines' life was direct and certain. She wanted to get married, she had always wanted to get married before she was twenty-five. For Helen, the singing partnership, the exploration of new lands, had been a gesture toward freedom, an instinctive groping toward a centre of life and purpose to which she could fasten her energy, a blind hunger for variety, beauty, and independence. She did not know what she wanted to do with her life; it was probable that she would never control even partially her destiny: she would be controlled, when the time came, by the great necessity that lived in her. That necessity was to enslave and to serve.",1
994,"For two or three years Helen and Pearl supported themselves by these tours, leaving Altamont during its dull winter lassitude, and returning to it in Spring, or in Summer, with money enough to suffice them until their next season. Pearl juggled carefully with the proposals of several young men during this period. She had the warmest affection for a ball- player, the second baseman and manager of the Altamont team. He was a tough handsome young animal, forever hurling his glove down in a frenzy of despair during the course of a game, and rushing belligerently at the umpire. She liked his hard assurance, his rapid twang, his tanned lean body.",1
995,"But she was in love with no one--she would never be--and caution told her that the life-risk on bush-league ball-players was very great. She married finally a young man from Jersey City, heavy of hand, hoof, and voice, who owned a young but flourishing truck and livery business. Thus, the partnership of the Dixie Melody Twins was dissolved. Helen, left alone, turned away from the drear monotony of the small towns to the gaiety, the variety, and the slaking fulfilment of her desires, which she hoped somehow to find in the cities.",1
996,"She missed Luke terribly. Without him she felt incomplete, unarmored. He had been enrolled in the Georgia School of Technology in Atlanta for two years. He was taking the course in electrical engineering, the whole direction of his life had been thus shaped by Gant's eulogies, years before, of the young electrical expert, Liddell. He was failing in his work--his mind had never been forced to the discipline of study. All purpose with him was broken by a thousand impulses: his brain stammered as did his tongue, and as he turned impatiently and irritably to the logarithm tables, he muttered the number of the page in idiot repetition, keeping up a constant wild vibration of his leg upon the ball of his foot.",1
997,"His great commercial talent was salesmanship; he had superlatively that quality that American actors and men of business call ""personality""--a wild energy, a Rabelaisian vulgarity, a sensory instinct for rapid and swinging repartee, and a hypnotic power of speech, torrential, meaningless, mad, and evangelical. He could sell anything because, in the jargon of salesmen, he could sell himself; and there was a fortune in him in the fantastic elasticity of American business, the club of all the queer trades, of wild promotions, where, amok with zealot rage, he could have chanted the yokels into delirium, and cut the buttons from their coats, doing every one, everything, and finally himself. He was not an electrical engineer--he was electrical energy. He had no gift for study--he gathered his unriveted mind together and bridged with it desperately, but crumpled under the stress and strain of calculus and the mechanical sciences.",1
998,"Enormous humor flowed from him like crude light. Men who had never known him seethed with strange internal laughter when they saw him, and roared helplessly when he began to speak. Yet, his physical beauty was astonishing. His head was like that of a wild angel-- coils and whorls of living golden hair flashed from his head, his features were regular, generous, and masculine, illuminated by the strange inner smile of idiot ecstasy.",1
999,"His broad mouth, even when stammering irritably or when nervousness clouded his face, was always cocked for laughter--unearthly, exultant, idiot laughter. There was in him demonic exuberance, a wild intelligence that did not come from the brain. Eager for praise, for public esteem, and expert in ingratiation, this demon possessed him utterly at the most unexpected moments, in the most decorous surroundings, when he was himself doing all in his power to preserve the good opinion in which he was held.",1
1000,"Thus, listening to an old lady of the church, who with all her power of persuasion and earnestness was unfolding the dogmas of Presbyterianism to him, he would lean forward in an attitude of exaggerated respectfulness and attention, one broad hand clinched about his knee, while he murmured gentle agreement to what she said:  ""Yes? . . . Ye-e-es? . . . Ye-e-e-es? . . . Ye-e-es? . . . Is that right? . . . Ye-e-es?""  Suddenly the demonic force would burst in him.",1
1001,"Insanely tickled at the cadences of his agreement, the earnest placidity and oblivion of the old woman, and the extravagant pretense of the whole situation, his face flooded with wild exultancy, he would croon in a fat luscious bawdily suggestive voice:  ""Y-ah-s? . . . Y-a-h-s? . . . Y-a-h-s? . . . Y-ah-s?",1
1002,"And when at length too late she became aware of this drowning flood of demonic nonsense, and paused, turning an abrupt startled face to him, he would burst into a wild ""Whah-whah-whah-whah"" of laughter, beyond all reason, with strange throat noises, tickling her roughly in the ribs. Often Eliza, in the midst of long, minutely replenished reminiscence, would grow conscious, while she was purse-lipped in revery, of this annihilating mockery, would slap at his hand angrily as he gooched her, and shake a pursed piqued face at him, saying, with a heavy scorn that set him off into fresh ""whah- whahs"": I'll declare, boy! You act like a regular idiot,"" and then shaking her head sadly, with elaborate pity:  ""I'd be ash-a- amed! A-sha-a-med.",1
1003,"His quality was extraordinary; he had something that was a great deal better than most intelligence; he saw the world in burlesque, and his occasional answer to its sham, hypocrisy, and intrigue was the idiot devastation of ""whah-whah! But he did not possess his demon; it possessed him from time to time. If it had possessed him wholly, constantly, his life would have prevailed with astonishing honesty and precision. But when he reflected, he was a child--with all the hypocrisy, sentimentality and dishonest pretense of a child.",1
1004,"His face was a church in which beauty and humor were married--the strange and the familiar were at one in him. Men, looking at Luke, felt a start of recognition as if they saw something of which they had never heard, but which they had known forever. Once or twice, during the Winter and Spring, while she was touring with Pearl Hines, Helen got into Atlanta to see him. In Spring they attended the week of Grand Opera. He would find employment for one night as a spearman in Aïda and pass the doorman for the remainder of the week with the assurance that he was ""a member of the company--Lukio Gantio. His large feet spread tightly out in sandals; behind the shingreaves his awkward calves were spined thickly with hair; a thick screw of hair writhed under the edge of his tin helmet, as he loafed in the wings, leaning comically on his spear, his face lit with exultancy.",1
1005,"Caruso, waiting his entrance, regarded him from time to time with a wide Wop smile. Wotta you call yourself, eh?"" asked Caruso, approaching and looking him over. W-w-w-why,"" he said, ""d-don't you know one of your s-s-s-soldiers when you see him?""  ""You're one hell of a soldier,"" said Caruso.",1
1006,Whah-whah-whah! Luke answered. With difficulty he restrained his prodding fingers.,1
1007,"In the summer now he returned to Altamont, finding employment with a firm of land-auctioneers, and assisting them at the sale of a tract or a parcel of lots. He moved about above the crowd in the bed of a wagon, exhorting them to bid, with his hand at the side of his mouth, in a harangue compounded of frenzy, passionate solicitation, and bawdry. The work intoxicated him. With wide grins of expectancy they crowded round the spokes. In a high throaty tenor he called to them:  ""Step right up, gentlemen, lot number 17, in beautiful Homewood--we furnish the wood, you furnish the home.",1
1008,"Now gentlemen, this handsome building-site has a depth of 179 feet, leaving plenty of room for garden and backhouse (grow your own corn cobs in beautiful Homewood) with a frontage of 114 feet on a magnificent new macadam road. Where is the road? some one shouted.",1
1009,"On the blueprint, of course, Colonel. You've got it all in black and white. Now, gentlemen, the opportunity of your lives is kicking you in the pants. Are you men of vision? Think what Ford, Edison, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Julius Caesar would do. Obey that impulse. You can't lose. The town is coming this way. Listen carefully. Do you hear it? Swell. The new courthouse will be built on yonder hill, the undertaker and the village bakery will occupy handsome edifices of pressed brick just above you. Oyez, oyez, oyez. What am I offered? What am I offered? Own your own home in beautiful Homewood, within a cannonshot of all railway, automobile, and airplane connections. Running water abounds within a Washingtonian stone's throw and in all the pipes. Our caravans meet all trains. Gentlemen, here's your chance to make a fortune. The ground is rich in mineral resources--gold, silver, copper, iron, bituminous coal and oil, will be found in large quantities below the roots of all the trees. What about the bushes, Luke?"" yelled Mr. Halloran, the dairy-lunch magnate.",1
1010,"Down in the bushes, that is where she gushes,"" Luke answered amid general tumult. All right, Major. You with the face. What am I offered? What am I offered? When there was no sale, he greeted incoming tourists at the station-curbing with eloquent invitations to Dixieland, rich, persuasive, dominant above all the soliciting babel of the car- drivers, negro hotel-porters, and boarding-house husbands.",1
1011,"I'll give you a dollar apiece for every one you drum up,"" said Eliza. O that's all right. O modestly. Generously.",1
1012,"He'd give you the shirt off his back,"" said Gant. A fine boy. As she cooled from her labors in the summer night, he brought her little boxes of ice-cream from town.",1
1013,"He was a hustler: he sold patent washboards, trick potato-peelers, and powdered cockroach-poison from house to house. To the negroes he sold hair-oil guaranteed to straighten kinky hair, and religious lithographs, peopled with flying angels, white and black, and volant cherubs, black and white, sailing about the knees of an impartial and crucified Saviour, and subtitled ""God Loves Them Both. They sold like hot cakes.",1
1014,"Otherwise, he drove Gant's car--a 1913 five-passenger Ford, purchase of an inspired hour of madness, occupant now of half Gant's conversation, object of abuse, boast, and anathema. It was before every one owned a car. Gant was awed and terrified by his rash act, exalted at the splendor of his chariot, appalled at its expense. Each bill for gasoline, repairs, or equipment brought a howl of anguish from him; a puncture, a breakdown, a minor disorder caused him to circle about in maddened strides, cursing, praying, weeping.",1
1015,"I've never had a moment's peace since I bought it,"" he howled. Accursed and bloody monster that it is, it will not be content until it has sucked out my life-blood, sold the roof over my head, and sent me out to the pauper's grave to perish. Merciful God,"" he wept, ""it's fearful, it's awful, it's cruel that I should be afflicted thus in my old age. Turning to his constrained and apologetic son abruptly, he said:  ""How much is the bill? Hey?"" His eyes roved wildly in his head.",1
1016,"D-d-d-don't get excited, papa,"" Luke answered soothingly, teetering from foot to foot, ""it's only $8.92. Jesus God! Gant screamed. I'm ruined. Sobbing in loud burlesque sniffles, he began his caged pacing.",1
1017,"But it was pleasant at dusk or in the cool summer nights, with Eliza or one of his daughters beside him, and a fragrant weed between his pallid lips, to hinge his long body into the back seat, and ride out into the fragrant countryside, or through the long dark streets of town. At the approach of another car he cried out in loud alarm, by turns cursing and entreating his son to caution. Luke drove nervously, erratically, wildly--his stammering impatient hands and knees communicated their uneven fidget to the flivver. He cursed irritably, plunged in exacerbated fury at the brake, and burst out in an annoyed ""tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh,"" when the car stalled.",1
1018,"As the hour grew late, and the streets silent, his madness swelled in him. Lipping the rim of a long hill street, tree-arched and leafy and shelving in even terraces, he would burst suddenly into insane laughter, bend over the wheel, and pull the throttle open, his idiot ""whah-whahs"" filling the darkness as Gant screamed curses at him. Down through the night they tore at murderous speed, the boy laughing at curse and prayer alike as they shot past the blind menace of street-crossings.",1
1019,"You Goddamned scoundrel! Gant yelled. Stop, you mountain grill, or I'll put you in jail. Whah-whah.",1
1020,"--His laughter soared to a crazy falsetto. Daisy, arrived for a few weeks of summer coolness, quite blue with terror, would clutch the most recent of her annual arrivals to her breast, melodramatically, and moan: I beg of you, for the sake of my family, for the sake of my innocent motherless babes--""  ""Whah-whah-whah!""  ""He's a fiend out of hell,"" cried Gant, beginning to weep.",1
1021,"Cruel and criminal monster that he is, he will batter our brains out against a tree, before he's done. They whizzed with a perilous swerve by a car that, with a startled screech of its brakes, balked at the corner like a frightened horse. You damned thug! Gant roared, plunging forward and fastening his great hands around Luke's throat. Will you stop?""  Luke added another notch of blazing speed.",1
1022,"Gant fell backward with a howl of terror. On Sunday they made long tours into the country. Often they drove to Reynoldsville, twenty-two miles away. It was an ugly little resort, noisy with arriving and departing cars, with a warm stench of oil and gasoline heavy above its broad main street. But people were coming and going from several States: Southward they came up from South Carolina and Georgia, cotton-farmers, small tradesmen and their families in battered cars coated with red sandclay dust. They had a heavy afternoon dinner of fried chicken, corn, string- beans, and sliced tomatoes, at one of the big wooden boarding-house hotels, spent another hour in a drugstore over a chocolate nut- sundae, watched the summer crowd of fortunate tourists and ripe cool-skinned virgins flow by upon the wide sidewalk in thick pullulation, and returned again, after a brief tour of the town, on the winding immediate drop to the hot South. New lands.",1
1023,"Fluescent with smooth ripe curves, the drawling virgins of the South filled summer porches. Luke was a darling. He was a dear, a fine boy, a big-hearted generous fellow, and just the cutest thing. Women liked him, laughed at him, pulled fondly the thick golden curls of his hair. He was sentimentally tender to children--girls of fourteen years. He had a grand romantic feeling for Delia Selborne, the oldest daughter of Mrs. Selborne. He bought her presents, was tender and irritable by turns. Once, at Gant's, on the porch under an August moon and the smell of ripening grapes, he caressed her while Helen sang in the parlor. He caressed her gently, leaned his head over her, and said he would like to lay it on her b-b-b-b-breast. Eugene watched them bitterly, with an inch of poison round his heart. He wanted the girl for himself: she was stupid, but she had the wise body and faint hovering smile of her mother. He wanted Mrs. Selborne more, he fantasied passionately about her yet, but her image lived again in Delia. As a result, he was proud, cold, scornful and foolish before them. They disliked him.",1
1024,"Enviously, with gnawn heart, he observed Luke's ministrations to Mrs. Selborne. His service was so devout, so extravagant that even Helen grew annoyed and occasionally jealous. And nightly, from a remote corner at Gant's or Eliza's, or from a parked automobile before the house, he heard her rich welling laughter, full of tenderness, surrender, and mystery. Sometimes, waiting in pitch darkness on the stairs at Eliza's, at one or two o'clock in the morning, he felt her pass him. As she touched him in the dark, she gave a low cry of terror; with an uncivil grunt he reassured her, and descended to bed with a pounding heart and burning face.",1
1025,"Ah, yes, he thought, with green morality, observing his brother throned in laughter and affection, you Big Fool, you--you're just a sucker! You show off and act big, my sonny, and spend your money bringing ice-cream for them--but what do you get out of it? How do you feel when she gets out of an automobile at two o'clock in the morning after grunting in the dark with some damned travelling-man, or with old Poxy Logan who's been keeping a nigger woman up for years. May I p-p-p-put my head on your breast? You make me sick, you damned fool. SHE'S no better, only you don't know beans. She'll let you spend all your money on her and then she'll run off with some little pimp in an automobile for the rest of the night. Yes, that's so. Do you want to make anything out of it? You big bluff. Come out into the back yard. . . . I'll show you . . . take that . . . and that . . . and that . . .",1
1026,"Pumping his fists wildly, he fought his phantom into defeat and himself into exhaustion. Luke had several hundred dollars saved from The Saturday Evening Post days, when he went off to school. He accepted very little money from Gant. He waited on tables, he solicited for college boarding-houses, he was the agent for a tailor who made Kippy Kampus Klothes. Gant boasted of these efforts. The town shifted its quid, nodded pertly, and spat, saying:  ""That boy'll make his mark.",1
1027,Luke worked as hard for an education as any other self-made man. He made every sacrifice. He did everything but study.,1
1028,"He was an immense popular success, so very extra, so very Luky. The school sought and adored him. Twice, after football games, he mounted a hearse and made funeral orations over the University of Georgia.",1
1029,"But, in spite of all his effort, toward the end of his third year he was still a sophomore, with every prospect of remaining one. One day in Spring he wrote the following letter to Gant:  ""The b-b-b-bastards who r-r-run this place have it in for me. I've been c-c-c-crooked good and proper. They take your hard-earned m- m-money here and skin you. I'm g-g-g-going to a real school. He went to Pittsburgh and found work with the Westinghouse Electric Company.",1
1030,Three times a week at night he attended courses at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. He made friends. The war had come. After fifteen months in Pittsburgh he moved on to Dayton where he got employment at a boiler factory engaged in the fabrication of war materials.,1
1031,"From time to time, in summer for a few weeks, at Christmas for a few days, he returned to celebrate his holidays with his family. Always he brought Gant a suitcase stocked with beer and whisky. That boy was ""good to his father. 19   One afternoon in the young summer, Gant leaned upon the rail, talking to Jannadeau.",1
1032,"He was getting on to sixty-five, his erect body had settled, he stooped a little. He spoke of old age often, and he wept in his tirades now because of his stiffened hand. Soaked in pity, he referred to himself as ""the poor old cripple who has to provide for them all. The indolence of age and disintegration was creeping over him.",1
1033,"He now rose a full hour late, he came to his shop punctually, but he spent long hours of the day extended on the worn leather couch of his office, or in gossip with Jannadeau, bawdy old Liddell, Cardiac, and Fagg Sluder, who had salted away his fortune in two big buildings on the Square and was at the present moment tilted comfortably in a chair before the fire department, gossiping eagerly with members of the ball club, whose chief support he was. It was after five o'clock, the game was over. Negro laborers, grisly with a white coating of cement, sloped down past the shop on their way home. The draymen dispersed slowly, a slouchy policeman loafed down the steps of the city hall picking his teeth, and on the market side, from high grilled windows, there came the occasional howls of a drunken negress. Life buzzed slowly like a fly.",1
1034,"The sun had reddened slightly, there was a cool flowing breath from the hills, a freshening relaxation over the tired earth, the hope, the ecstasy of evening in the air. In slow pulses the thick plume of fountain rose, fell upon itself, and slapped the pool in lazy rhythms. A wagon rattled leanly over the big cobbles; beyond the firemen, the grocer Bradley wound up his awning with slow creaking revolutions.",1
1035,"Across the Square, at its other edge, the young virgins of the eastern part of town walked lightly home in chattering groups. They came to town at four o'clock in the afternoon, walked up and down the little avenue several times, entered a shop to purchase small justifications, and finally went into the chief drugstore, where the bucks of the town loafed and drawled in lazy alert groups. It was their club, their brasserie, the forum of the sexes. With confident smiles the young men detached themselves from their group and strolled back to booth and table.",1
1036,"Hey theah! Wheahd you come from? Move ovah theah, lady.",1
1037,"I want to tawk to you. Eyes as blue as Southern skies looked roguishly up to laughing gray ones, the winsome dimples deepened, and the sweetest little tail in dear old Dixie slid gently over on the polished board. Gant spent delightful hours now in the gossip of dirty old men-- their huddled bawdry exploded in cracked high wheezes on the Square. He came home at evening stored with gutter tidings, wetting his thumb and smiling slyly as he questioned Helen hopefully:  ""She's no better than a regular little chippie--eh?""  ""Ha-ha-ha-ha,"" she laughed mockingly.",1
1038,"Don't you wish you knew? His age bore certain fruits, emoluments of service. When she came home in the evening with one of her friends, she presented the girl with jocose eagerness to his embrace. And, crying out paternally, ""Why, bless her heart! Come kiss the old man,"" he planted bristling mustache kisses on their white throats, their soft lips, grasping the firm meat of one arm tenderly with his good hand and cradling them gently. They shrieked with throaty giggle-twiddles of pleasure because it tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh-TICKLED so.",1
1039,"Ooh!  Mr. Gant!  Whah-whah-whah!""  ""Your father's such a nice man,"" they said. Such lovely manners. Helen's eyes fed fiercely on them.",1
1040,"She laughed with husky-harsh excitement. Hah-ha-ha! He likes that, doesn't he? It's too bad, old boy, isn't it? No more monkey business. He talked with Jannadeau, while his fugitive eyes roved over the east end of the Square.",1
1041,"Before the shop the comely matrons of the town came up from the market. From time to time they smiled, seeing him, and he bowed sweepingly. Such lovely manners.",1
1042,"The King of England,"" he observed, ""is only a figurehead. He doesn't begin to have the power of the President of the United States. His power is severely li-MIT-ed,"" said Jannadeau gutturally, ""by custom but not by statute.",1
1043,"In actua-LITY he is still one of the most powerful monarchs in the world. His thick black fingers probed carefully into the viscera of a watch. The late King Edward for all his faults,"" said Gant, wetting his thumb, ""was a smart man. This fellow they've got now is a nonentity and a nincompoop. He grinned faintly, craftily, with pleasure at the big words, glancing slily at the Swiss to see if they had told.",1
1044,"His uneasy eyes followed carefully the stylish carriage of ""Queen"" Elizabeth's well clad figure as she went down by the shop. She smiled pleasantly, and for a moment turned her candid stare upon smooth marble slabs of death, carved lambs and cherubim. Gant bowed elaborately.",1
1045,"Good-evening, madam,"" he said. She disappeared. In a moment she came back decisively and mounted the broad steps. He watched her approach with quickened pulses. Twelve years.",1
1046,"How's the madam?"" he said gallantly. Elizabeth, I was just telling Jannadeau you were the most stylish woman in town. Well, that's mighty sweet of you, Mr. Gant,"" she said in her cool poised voice.",1
1047,"You've always got a word for every one. She gave a bright pleasant nod to Jannadeau, who swung his huge scowling head ponderously around and muttered at her. Why, Elizabeth,"" said Gant, ""you haven't changed an inch in fifteen years. I don't believe you're a day older. She was thirty-eight and pleasantly aware of it.",1
1048,"Oh, yes,"" she said laughing. You're only saying that to make me feel good. I'm no chicken any more. She had a pale clear skin, pleasantly freckled, carrot-colored hair, and a thin mouth live with humor.",1
1049,"Her figure was trim and strong--no longer young. She had a great deal of energy, distinction, and elegance in her manner. How are all the girls, Elizabeth?"" he asked kindly.",1
1050,"Her face grew sad. She began to pull her gloves off. That's what I came to see you about,"" she said. I lost one of them last week. Yes,"" said Gant gravely, ""I was sorry to hear of that.",1
1051,"She was the best girl I had,"" said Elizabeth. I'd have done anything in the world for her. We did everything we could,"" she added. I've no regrets on that score. I had a doctor and two trained nurses by her all the time. She opened her black leather handbag, thrust her gloves into it, and pulling out a small bluebordered handkerchief, began to weep quietly.",1
1052,"Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh,"" said Gant, shaking his head. Too bad, too bad, too bad. Come back to my office,"" he said. They went back and sat down. Elizabeth dried her eyes.",1
1053,"What was her name?"" he asked. We called her Lily--her full name was Lillian Reed. Why, I knew that girl,"" he exclaimed.",1
1054,"I spoke to her not over two weeks ago. Yes,"" said Elizabeth, ""she went like that--one hemorrhage right after another, down here. She tapped her abdomen. Nobody ever knew she was sick until last Wednesday. Friday she was gone. She wept again.",1
1055,"T-t-t-t-t-t,"" he clucked regretfully. Too bad, too bad. She was pretty as a picture. I couldn't have loved her more, Mr. Gant,"" said Elizabeth, ""if she had been my own daughter.",1
1056,"How old was she? he asked. Twenty-two,"" said Elizabeth, beginning to weep again.",1
1057,"What a pity! What a pity! he agreed. Did she have any people? No one who would do anything for her,"" Elizabeth said.",1
1058,"Her mother died when she was thirteen--she was born out here on the Beetree Fork--and her father,"" she added indignantly, ""is a mean old bastard who's never done anything for her or any one else. He didn't even come to her funeral. He will be punished,"" said Gant darkly.",1
1059,"As sure as there's a God in heaven,"" Elizabeth agreed, ""he'll get what's coming to him in hell. The old bastard! she continued virtuously, ""I hope he rots! You can depend upon it,"" he said grimly.",1
1060,"He will. Ah, Lord. He was silent a moment while he shook his head with slow regret.",1
1061,"A pity, a pity,"" he muttered. So young. He had the moment of triumph all men have when they hear some one has died. A moment, too, of grisly fear. Sixty-four.",1
1062,"I couldn't have loved her more,"" said Elizabeth, ""if she'd been one of my own. A young girl like that, with all her life before her. It's pretty sad when you come to think of it,"" he said.",1
1063,"By God, it is. And she was such a fine girl, Mr. Gant,"" said Elizabeth, weeping softly. She had such a bright future before her. She had more opportunities than I ever had, and I suppose you know""--she spoke modestly--""what I've done. Why,"" he exclaimed, startled, ""you're a rich woman, Elizabeth-- damned if I don't believe you are.",1
1064,"You own property all over town. I wouldn't say that,"" she answered, ""but I've got enough to live on without ever doing another lick of work. I've had to work hard all my life. From now on I don't intend to turn my hand over. She regarded him with a shy pleased smile, and touched a coil of her fine hair with a small competent hand.",1
1065,"He looked at her attentively, noting with pleasure her firm uncorseted hips, moulded compactly into her tailored suit, and her cocked comely legs tapering to graceful feet, shod in neat little slippers of tan. She was firm, strong, washed, and elegant--a faint scent of lilac hovered over her: he looked at her candid eyes, lucently gray, and saw that she was quite a great lady. By God, Elizabeth,"" he said, ""you're a fine-looking woman. I've had a good life,"" she said.",1
1066,"I've taken care of myself. They had always known each other--since first they met. They had no excuses, no questions, no replies. The world fell away from them. In the silence they heard the pulsing slap of the fountain, the high laughter of bawdry in the Square. He took a book of models from the desk, and began to turn its slick pages. They showed modest blocks of Georgia marble and Vermont granite.",1
1067,"I don't want any of those,"" she said impatiently. I've already made up my mind. I know what I want. He looked up surprised.",1
1068,"What is it?""  ""I want the angel out front. His face was shocked and unwilling. He gnawed the corner of his thin lip. No one knew how fond he was of the angel. Publicly he called it his White Elephant. He cursed it and said he had been a fool to order it. For six years it had stood on the porch, weathering, in all the wind and the rain. It was now brown and fly-specked. But it had come from Carrara in Italy, and it held a stone lily delicately in one hand. The other hand was lifted in benediction, it was poised clumsily upon the ball of one phthisic foot, and its stupid white face wore a smile of soft stone idiocy.",1
1069,"In his rages, Gant sometimes directed vast climaxes of abuse at the angel. Fiend out of Hell! he roared. You have impoverished me, you have ruined me, you have cursed my declining years, and now you will crush me to death, fearful, awful, and unnatural monster that you are.",1
1070,"But sometimes when he was drunk he fell weeping on his knees before it, called it Cynthia, and entreated its love, forgiveness, and blessing for its sinful but repentant boy. There was laughter from the Square. What's the matter?"" said Elizabeth. Don't you want to sell it?""  ""It will cost you a good deal, Elizabeth,"" he said evasively.",1
1071,"I don't care,"" she answered, positively. I've got the money. How much do you want? He was silent, thinking for a moment of the place where the angel stood.",1
1072,"He knew he had nothing to cover or obliterate that place-- it left a barren crater in his heart. All right,"" he said. You can have it for what I paid for it-- $420. She took a thick sheaf of banknotes from her purse and counted the money out for him.",1
1073,"He pushed it back. No.  Pay me when the job's finished and it has been set up. You want some sort of inscription, don't you?""  ""Yes.",1
1074,"There's her full name, age, place of birth, and so on,"" she said, giving him a scrawled envelope. I want some poetry, too-- something that suits a young girl taken off like this. He pulled his tattered little book of inscriptions from a pigeonhole, and thumbed its pages, reading her a quatrain here and there.",1
1075,"To each she shook her head. Finally, he said:  ""How's this one, Elizabeth? He read:         She went away in beauty's flower,       Before her youth was spent;       Ere life and love had lived their hour       God called her, and she went.",1
1076,"Yet whispers Faith upon the wind:       No grief to her was given. She left YOUR love and went to find       A greater one in heaven. Oh, that's lovely--lovely,"" she said. I want that one. Yes,"" he agreed, ""I think that's the best one.",1
1077,"In the musty cool smell of his little office they got up. Her gallant figure reached his shoulder. She buttoned her kid gloves over the small pink haunch of her palms and glanced about her. His battered sofa filled one wall, the line of his long body was printed in the leather. She looked up at him. His face was sad and grave. They remembered.",1
1078,"It's been a long time, Elizabeth,"" he said. They walked slowly to the front through aisled marbles. Sentinelled just beyond the wooden doors, the angel leered vacantly down. Jannadeau drew his great head turtlewise a little further into the protective hunch of his burly shoulders. They went out on to the porch.",1
1079,"The moon stood already, like its own phantom, in the clear washed skies of evening. A little boy with an empty paper-delivery bag swung lithely by, his freckled nostrils dilating pleasantly with hunger and the fancied smell of supper. He passed, and for a moment, as they stood at the porch edge, all life seemed frozen in a picture: the firemen and Fagg Sluder had seen Gant, whispered, and were now looking toward him; a policeman, at the high side- porch of the Police Court, leaned on the rail and stared; at the near edge of the central grass-plot below the fountain, a farmer bent for water at a bubbling jet, rose dripping, and stared; from the Tax Collector's office, City Hall, upstairs, Yancey, huge, meaty, shirtsleeved, stared. And in that second the slow pulse of the fountain was suspended, life was held, like an arrested gesture, in photographic abeyance, and Gant felt himself alone move deathward in a world of seemings as, in 1910, a man might find himself again in a picture taken on the grounds of the Chicago Fair, when he was thirty and his mustache black, and, noting the bustled ladies and the derbied men fixed in the second's pullulation, remember the dead instant, seek beyond the borders for what was there (he knew); or as a veteran who finds himself upon his elbow near Ulysses Grant, before the march, in pictures of the Civil War, and sees a dead man on a horse; or I should say, like some completed Don, who finds himself again before a tent in Scotland in his youth, and notes a cricket-bat long lost and long forgotten, the face of a poet who has died, and young men and the tutor as they looked that Long Vacation when they read nine hours a day for ""Greats.",1
1080,"Where now? Where after? Where then?    20   Gant, during these years in which Helen and Luke, the two for whom he felt the deepest affection, were absent a large part of the time, lived a splintered existence at home and at Eliza's.",1
1081,"He feared and hated a lonely life, but habit was deeply rooted in him, and he was unwilling to exchange the well-used comfort of his own home for the bald wintriness of Eliza's. She did not want him. She fed him willingly enough, but his tirades and his nightly sojourns, both longer and more frequent now that his daughter was absent, annoyed her more than they ever had before.",1
1082,"You have a place of your own,"" she cried fretfully. Why don't you stay in it? I don't want you around making trouble. Send him on,"" he moaned bitterly.",1
1083,"Send him on. Over the stones rattle his bones, he's only a beggar that nobody owns. Ah, Lord! The old drayhorse has had its day. Its race is run. Kick him out: the old cripple can no longer provide them with victuals, and they will throw him on the junkheap, unnatural and degenerate monsters that they are.",1
1084,"But he remained at Dixieland as long as there was any one to listen to him, and to the bleak little group of winter boarders he brought magic. They fed hungrily on all the dramatic gusto with which, lunging back and forth in the big rocker, before the blazing parlor fire, he told and retold the legends of his experience, taking, before their charmed eyes, an incident that had touched him romantically, and embellishing, weaving and building it up. A whole mythology grew up as, goggle-eyed, they listened:  General Fitzhugh Lee, who had reined up before the farmer boy and asked for a drink of water, now tossed off an oaken bucketful, questioned him closely concerning the best roads into Gettysburg, asked if he had seen detachments of the enemy, wrote his name down in a small book, and went off saying to his staff:  ""That boy will make his mark.",1
1085,"It is impossible to defeat an enemy which breeds boys like that. The Indians, whom he had passed amicably as he rode out into the New Mexican desert on a burro, seeking the ancient fort, now spurred after him with fell intent and wild scalping whoops. He rode furiously through muttering redskin villages, and found the protection of two cattlemen in the nick of time. The thief who had entered his room at dead of night in New Orleans, and picked up his clothes, and whom he had fought desperately upon the floor, he now pursued naked for seventeen blocks (not five) down Canal Street.",1
1086,"He went several times a week to the moving-picture shows, taking Eugene, and sitting, bent forward in hunched absorption, through two full performances. They came out at ten-thirty or eleven o'clock, on cold ringing pavements, into a world frozen bare--a dead city of closed shops, dressed windows, milliners' and clothiers' models posturing with waxen gaiety at congealed silence. On the Square the slackened fountain dropped a fat spire of freezing water into its thickening rim of ice. In summer, a tall spire blown in blue sheets of spray. When they turned it down it wilted--that was like a fountain, too. No wind blew.",1
1087,"His eyes fixed on the clean concrete walk, Gant strode on, muttering dramatically, composing a narrative of the picture. The cold steel of new sewing-machines glinted in dim light. The Singer building. Tallest in the world. The stitching hum of Eliza's machine. Needle through your finger before you know it. He winced. They passed the Sluder Building at the corner of the Square and turned left. Gets over $700 a month in office-rent from this alone. The window on the corner was filled with rubber syringes and thermos bottles. Drink Coca Cola. They say he stole the formula from old mountain woman. $50,000,000 now. Rats in the vats. Dope at Wood's better. Too weak here. He had recently acquired a taste for the beverage and drank four or five glasses a day.",1
1088,"D. Stern had his old shack on that corner twenty years before Fagg bought it. Belonged to Paston estate. Could have bought it for a song. Rich man now. D. moved to North Main now. The Jew's rich. Fortune out of winnies. They're hot, they're hot. In a broken pot. If I had a little time I'd make a little rhyme. Thirteen kids--she had one every year. As broad as she's long. They all get fat. Every one works. Sons pay father board. None of mine, I can assure you. The Jews get there.",1
1089,"The hunchback--what did they call him? One of Nature's Cruel Jests. Ah, Lord! What's become of old John Bunny? I used to like his pictures. Oh yes. Dead.",1
1090,"That pure look they have, at the end, when he kisses her, mused Eugene. Later--A Warmer Clime. Her long lashes curled down over her wet eyes, she was unable to meet his gaze. The sweet lips trembled with desire as, clasping her in a grip of steel, he bent down over her yielding body and planted hungry kisses on her mouth. When the purple canopy of dawn had been reft asunder by the rays of the invading sun. The Stranger. It wouldn't do to say the next morning. They have a thick coat of yellow paint all over their face. Meanwhile, in Old England. I wonder what they say to each other. They're a pretty tough lot, I suppose.",1
1091,A swift thrust of conviction left him unperturbed. The other was better. He thought of the Stranger. Steel-gray eyes. A steady face. An eighth of a second faster on the draw than any one else. Two-gun Bill Hart. Anderson of the Essanay. Strong quiet men.,1
1092,"He clapped his hand against his buttock with a sharp smack and shot the murderous forefinger at an ashcan, a lamp-post, and a barber- pole, with a snapping wrist. Gant, startled in composition, gave him a quick uneasy look. They walked on.",1
1093,"Came a day when Spring put forth her blossoms on the earth again. No, no--not that. Then all grew dark. Picture of a lily trampled on the earth. That means he bigged her. Art.  Filled her with thee a baby fair. You can't go away now. Why? Because--because-- her eyes dropped shyly, a slow flush mantled her cheek. He stared at her blankly for a moment, then his puzzled gaze--(O good!)--fell to the tiny object she was fingering nervously, with dawning comprehension. Blushing rosily, she tried to conceal the little jacket behind her. Grace! A great light broke on him! Do you mean it? She went to him with a cry, half laugh, half sob, and buried her burning face in his neck. You silly boy. Of course I mean it (you bastard!). The little dance girl. Smiling with wet lechery and manipulating his moist rope of cigar, Faro Jim shuffled a pack of cards slowly and fixed on her his vulturesque eye. A knife in his shiny boots, a small derringer and three aces up his ruffled sleeve, and suave murder in his heart. But the cold gray eyes of the Stranger missed nothing. Imperturbably he drank his Scotch, wheeled from the mirror with barking Colt just one-sixth of a second before the gambler could fire. Faro coughed and slid forward slowly upon the floor.",1
1094,"There was no sound now in the crowded room of the Triple Y.  Men stood petrified. The face of Bad Bill and the two Mexicans had turned a dirty gray. Finally, the sheriff spoke, turning with awe from the still figure on the sawdust floor.",1
1095,"By God, stranger! he ejaculated, ""I never knew the man lived who could beat Faro to the draw. What's yore name? In the fam'ly Bible back home, pardner,"" the Stranger drawled, ""it's Eugene Gant, but folks out here generally calls me The Dixie Ghost.",1
1096,There was a slow gasp of wonder from the crowd. Gawd! some one whispered. It's the Ghost!,1
1097,"As the Ghost turned coolly back to finish his interrupted drink, he found himself face to face with the little dancing girl. Two smoking globes of brine welled from the pellucid depths of her pure eyes and fell with a hot splash on his bronzed hand. How can I ever thank you! she cried. You have saved me from a fate far worse than death.",1
1098,"But the Ghost, who had faced death many times without a flicker of a lash, was unable to face something he saw now in a pair of big brown eyes. He took off his sombrero and twisted it shyly in his big hands. Why, that's all right, ma'am,"" he gulped awkwardly. Glad to be of service to a lady any time. By this time the two bartenders had thrown a table-cloth over Faro Bill, carried the limp body into the back room, and returned to their positions behind the bar.",1
1099,"The crowd clustered about in little groups, laughing and talking excitedly, and in a moment, as the pianist began to hammer out a tune on the battered piano, broke into the measures of a waltz. In the wild West of those days, passions were primitive, vengeance sudden, and retribution immediate. Two dimples sentinelled a platoon of milk-white teeth.",1
1100,"Won't you dance with me, Mr. Ghost?"" she coaxed. Thoughtfully he pondered on love's mystery. Pure but passionate. Appearances against her, 'tis true. The foul breath of slander. She worked in a bawdy-house but her heart was clean. Outside of that, what can one say against her? He thought pleasantly of murder. With child's eyes he regarded his extinct enemies. Men died violently but cleanly, in the movies. Bang-bang. Good-by, boys, I'm through. Through the head or heart--a clean hole, no blood. He had kept innocency. Do their guts or their brains come spilling out? Currant jelly where a face was, the chin shot off. Or down there that other--His arm beat the air like a wing: he writhed. If you lose that? Done, die. He clutched his throat in his anguish.",1
1101,"They bent down eastward along Academy Street, having turned right from the little caudal appendage that gave on the northeastern corner of the Square. The boy's mind flamed with bright streaming images, sharp as gems, mutable as chameleons. His life was the shadow of a shadow, a play within a play. He became the hero- actor-star, the lord of the cinema, and the lover of a beautiful movie-queen, as heroic as his postures, with a superior actuality for every make-believe. He was the Ghost and he who played the Ghost, the cause that minted legend into fact.",1
1102,"He was those heroes whom he admired, and the victor, in beauty, nobility, and sterling worth, over those whom he despised because they always triumphed and were forever good and pretty and beloved of women. He was chosen and beloved of a bevy of internationally renowned beauties, vampires and pure sweet girls alike, with fruity blondes in the lead, all contesting for his favors, and some of the least scrupulous resorting to underhand practices in order to win him. Their pure eyes turned up to him in everlasting close-ups: he feasted virtuously upon their proffered lips and, conflict over, murder sanctified, and virtue crowned, walked away with his siren into the convenient blaze of a constantly setting sun.",1
1103,"With burning sidelong face he looked quickly up at Gant, twisting his convulsive neck. Across the street, a calcium glare from the corner light bathed coldly the new brick facade of the Orpheum Theatre. All This Week Gus Nolan and His Georgia Peaches. Also the Piedmont Comedy Four and Miss Bobbie Dukane.",1
1104,"The theatre was dark, the second show was over. They stared curiously across the street at the posters. In this cold silence where were the Peaches? At the Athens now, upon the Square. They always went there after. Gant looked at his watch. 11:12. Big Bill Messier outside swinging his club and watching them. On the counter stools a dozen bucks and ogling rakehells. I've got a car outside. Dalliance under difficulties. Later, the Genevieve on Liberty Street. They all stay there. Whisperings. Footfalls. Raided.",1
1105,"Girls from good families, some of them, I suppose, Gant thought. Opposite the Baptist Church a hearse was drawn up before Gorham's Undertaking Parlors. A light burned dimly through the ferns. Who can that be? he wondered. Miss Annie Patton critically ill. She's past eighty. Some lunger from New York. A little Jew with a peaked face. Some one all the time. Await alike th' inevitable hour. Ah, Lord!",1
1106,"With loss of hunger, he thought of undertaking and undertakers, and in particular of Mr. Gorham. He was a man with blond hair and white eyebrows. Waited to marry her when that rich young Cuban died, so they could take honeymoon to Havana.",1
1107,"They turned down Spring Street by the Baptist Church. This is really like a city of the dead, Eugene thought. The town, rimmed with frost, lay frozen below the stars in a cataleptic trance. The animacy of life hung in abeyance. Nothing grew old, nothing decayed, nothing died. It was triumph over time. If a great demon snapped his fingers and stopped all life in the world for an instant that should be a hundred years, who would know the difference? Every man a Sleeping Beauty. If you're waking call me early, call me early, mother dear.",1
1108,"He tried to see life and movement behind the walls, and failed. He and Gant were all that lived. For a house betrays nothing: there may be murder behind its very quiet face. He thought that Troy should be like this--perfect, undecayed as the day when Hector died. Only they burned it. To find old cities as they were, unruined--the picture charmed him. The Lost Atlantis. Ville d'Ys. The old lost towns, seasunken. Great vacant ways, unrusted, echoed under his lonely feet; he haunted vast arcades, he pierced the atrium, his shoes rang on the temple flags.",1
1109,"Or to be, he lusciously meditated, left alone with a group of pretty women in a town whence all the other people had fled from some terror of plague, earthquake, volcano, or other menace to which he, quite happily, was immune. Lolling his tongue delicately, he saw himself loafing sybaritically through first- class confectioners' and grocers' shops, gorging like an anaconda on imported dainties: exquisite small fish from Russia, France, and Sardinia; coal-black hams from England; ripe olives, brandied peaches, and liqueur chocolates. He would loot old cellars for fat Burgundies, crack the gold necks of earth-chilled bottles of Pol Roger against the wall, and slake his noonday thirst at the spouting bung of a great butt of Münchener dunkels. When his linen was soiled he would outfit himself anew with silk underwear and the finest shirtings; he would have a new hat every day in the week and new suits whenever he pleased.",1
1110,"He would occupy a new house every day, and sleep in a different bed every night, selecting the most luxurious residence ultimately for permanent occupancy, and bringing together in it the richest treasures of every notable library in the city. Finally, when he wanted a woman from the small group that remained and that spent its time in weaving new enticements for him, he would summons her by ringing out the number he had given her on the Court House bell. He wanted opulent solitude. His dark vision burned on kingdoms under the sea, on windy castle crags, and on the deep elf kingdoms at the earth's core. He groped for the doorless land of faery, that illimitable haunted country that opened somewhere below a leaf or a stone. And no birds sing.",1
1111,"More practically, he saw for himself great mansions in the ground, grottoes buried in the deep heart of a hill, vast chambers of brown earth, sumptuously appointed with his bee-like plunder. Cool hidden cisterns would bring him air; from a peephole in the hillside he could look down on a winding road and see armed men seeking for him, or hear their thwarted gropings overhead. He would pull fat fish from subterranean pools, his great earth cellars would be stocked with old wine, he could loot the world of its treasures, including the handsomest women, and never be caught.",1
1112,"King Solomon's mines. She. Proserpine. Ali Baba. Orpheus and Eurydice. Naked came I from my mother's womb. Naked shall I return. Let the mothering womb of earth engulf me. Naked, a valiant wisp of man, in vast brown limbs engulfed.",1
1113,"They neared the corner above Eliza's. For the first time the boy noted that their pace had quickened, and that he had almost broken into a trot in order to keep up with Gant's awkward plunging strides. His father was moaning softly with long quivering exhalations of breath, and he had one hand clasped over his pain. The boy spluttered idiotically with laughter. Gant turned a glance full of reproach and physical torture upon him.",1
1114,"Oh-h-h-h-h! Merciful God,"" he whined, ""it's hurting me. Abruptly, Eugene was touched with pity.",1
1115,For the first time he saw plainly that great Gant had grown old. The sallow face had yellowed and lost its sinew. The thin mouth was petulant. The chemistry of decay had left its mark.,1
1116,"No, there was no return after this. Eugene saw now that Gant was dying very slowly. The vast resiliency, the illimitable power of former times had vanished. The big frame was breaking up before him like a beached ship. Gant was sick. He was old.",1
1117,"He had a disease that is very common among old men who have lived carelessly and lustily--enlargement of the prostate gland. It was not often in itself a fatal disease--it was more often one of the flags of age and death, but it was ugly and uncomfortable. It was generally treated successfully by surgery--the operation was not desperate. But Gant hated and feared the knife: he listened eagerly to all persuasions against it.",1
1118,"He had no gift for philosophy. He could not view with amusement and detachment the death of the senses, the waning of desire, the waxing of physical impotence. He fed hungrily, lewdly, on all news of seduction: his amusement had in it the eyes of eagerness, the hot breath of desire. He was incapable of the pleasant irony by which the philosophic spirit mocks that folly it is no longer able to enjoy.",1
1119,"Gant was incapable of resignation. He had the most burning of all lusts--the lust of memory, the ravenous hunger of the will which tries to waken what is dead. He had reached the time of life when he read the papers greedily for news of death. As friends and acquaintances died he shook his head with the melancholy hypocrisy of old men, saying:  ""They're all going, one by one. Ah, Lord! The old man will be the next. But he did not believe it. Death was still for the others, not for himself.",1
1120,"He grew old very rapidly. He began to die before their eyes--a quick age, and a slow death, impotent, disintegrating, horrible because his life had been so much identified with physical excess-- huge drinking, huge eating, huge rioting debauchery. It was fantastic and terrible to see the great body waste. They began to watch the progress of his disease with something of the horror with which one watches the movements of a dog with a broken leg, before he is destroyed--a horror greater than that one feels when a man has a similar hurt, because a man may live without legs. A dog is all included in his hide.",1
1121,"His wild bombast was tempered now by senile petulance. He cursed and whined by intervals. At the dead of night he would rise, full of pain and terror, blaspheming vilely against his God at one moment, and frantically entreating forgiveness at the next. Through all this tirade ran the high quivering exhalation of physical pain--actual and undeniable.",1
1122,"Oh-h-h-h! I curse the day I was born! . . . I curse the day I was given life by that bloodthirsty Monster up above . . . Oh-h-h- h-h! Jesus! I beg of you. I know I've been bad. Forgive me. Have mercy and pity upon me! Give me another chance, in Jesus' name . . . Oh-h-h-h-h!",1
1123,"Eugene had moments of furious anger because of these demonstrations. He was angry that Gant, having eaten his cake, now howled because he had stomach-ache and at the same time begged for more. Bitterly he reflected that his father's life had devoured whatever had served it, and that few men had had more sensuous enjoyment, or had been more ruthless in their demands on others. He found these exhibitions, these wild denunciations and cowardly grovellings in propitiation of a God none of them paid any attention to in health, ugly and abominable. The constant meditation of both Gant and Eliza on the death of others, their morbid raking of the news for items announcing the death of some person known to them, their weird absorption with the death of some toothless hag who, galled by bedsores, at length found release after her eightieth year, while fire, famine, and slaughter in other parts of the world passed unnoticed by them, their extravagant superstition over what was local and unimportant, seeing the intervention of God in the death of a peasant, and the suspension of divine law and natural order in their own, filled him with choking fury.",1
1124,"But Eliza was in splendid condition now to ponder upon the death of others. Her health was perfect. She was in her middle-fifties: she had grown triumphantly stronger after the diseases of the middle years. White, compact, a great deal heavier now than she had ever been, she performed daily tasks of drudgery in the maintenance of Dixieland, that would have floored a strong negro. She hardly ever got to bed before two o'clock in the morning, and was up again before seven.",1
1125,"She admitted her health grudgingly. She made the most of every ache, and she infuriated Gant by meeting every complaint with a corresponding account of her own disorders. When badgered by Helen because of her supposed neglect of the sick man or when the concentration of attention upon the invalid piqued her jealousy, she smiled with white tremulous bitterness, hinting darkly:  ""He may not be the first to go.",1
1126,"I had a premonition--I don't know what else you'd call it--the other day. I tell you what--it may not be long now--""  Her eyes bleared with pity--shaking her puckered mouth, she wept at her own funeral. Good heavens, mama! Helen burst out furiously. There's nothing wrong with you. Papa's a sick man! Don't you realize that? She didn't.",1
1127,Pshaw! she said. There's nothing much wrong with him. McGuire told me two men out of three have it after they're fifty. His body as it sickened distilled a green bile of hatred against her crescent health.,1
1128,"It made him mad to see her stand so strong. Murderous impotent, baffled--a maniacal anger against her groped for an outlet in him, sometimes exploding in a wild inchoate scream. He yielded weakly to invalidism, he became tyrannous of attention, jealous of service. Her indifference to his health maddened him, created a morbid hunger for pity and tears. At times he got insanely drunk and tried to frighten her by feigning death, one time so successfully that Ben, bending over his rigid form in the hallway, was whitened with conviction.",1
1129,"I can't feel his heart, mama,"" he said, with a nervous whicker of his lips. Well,"" she said, picking her language with deliberate choosiness, ""the pitcher went to the well once too often. I knew it would happen sooner or later. Through a slotted eye he glared murderously at her.",1
1130,"Judicially, with placid folded hands, she studied him. Her calm eye caught the slow movement of a stealthy inhalation. You get his purse, son, and any papers he may have,"" she directed. I'll call the undertaker. With an infuriate scream the dead awakened.",1
1131,"I thought that would bring you to,"" she said complacently. He scrambled to his feet. You hell-hound! he yelled. You would drink my heart's blood. You are without mercy and without pity--inhuman and bloody monster that you are. Some day,"" Eliza observed, ""you'll cry wolf-wolf once too often.",1
1132,"He went three times a week to Cardiac's office for treatment. The dry doctor had grown old; behind his dusty restraint, the prim authority of his manner, there was a deepening well of senile bawdry. He had a comfortable fortune, he cared little for his dwindling practice. He was still a brilliant bacteriologist: he spent hours over slides etched in flowering patterns of bacilli, and he was sought after by diseased prostitutes, to whom he rendered competent service.",1
1133,"He dissuaded the Gants from surgery. He was jealously absorbed in the treatment of Gant's disease, scoffed at operations, and insisted he could give adequate relief by manipulation of the affected parts and the use of the catheter. The two men became devoted friends. The doctor gave up entire mornings to the treatment of Gant's disease. The consulting-room was filled with their sly laughter while scrofulous mountaineers glared dully at the pages of Life in the antechamber. As Gant sprawled out voluptuously on the table after his masseur had finished his work, he listened appreciatively to the secrets of light women, or to tidbits from books of pseudoscientific pornography, of which the doctor had a large number.",1
1134,"You say,"" he demanded eagerly, ""that the monks petitioned the archbishop?""  ""Yes,"" said the doctor. They suffered during the hot weather. He wrote 'granted' across the petition. Here's a photograph of the document. He held the book open in his clean parched fingers.",1
1135,"Merciful God!"" said Gant, staring. I suppose it's pretty bad in those hot countries. He licked his thumb, smiling lewdly to himself.",1
1136,"The late Oscar Wilde, for instance. 21   During the first years of this illness Gant showed a diminished, but not a seriously impaired, energy. At first he had, under the doctor's treatment, periods of tranquillity when he almost believed himself well. There were also times when he became a whining dotard over night, lay indolently abed for days, and was flabbily acquiescent to his disorder. These climaxes usually came on the heels of a roaring spree. The saloons had been closed for years: the town had been one of the first to vote on ""local option. Gant had piously contributed his vote for purity.",1
1137,"Eugene remembered the day, years before, when he went proudly with his father to the polls. The militant ""drys"" had agreed to advertise their vote by wearing a scrap of white silk in their lapels. That was for purity. The defiant wets wore ""red.""  Announced by violent trumpetings in the Protestant churches, the day of atonement dawned on a seasoned army of well drilled teetotalers.",1
1138,"Those wets who had victoriously withstood the pressure of hearth and pulpit--their number (aië, aië,) was small-- went to their death with the gallant swagger, and with the gleam of purloined honor, of men who are to die fighting most desperately against the engulfing mob. They did not know how gallant was their cause: they knew only that they had stood against the will of a priest-ridden community--the most annihilating force in the village. They had never been told they stood for liberty; they stood rubily, stubbornly, with the strong brown smell of shame in their nostrils, for the bloodshot, malt-mouthed, red-nosed, loose-pursed Demon Rum. So, they came down with vine leaves in their hair, and a good fog of rye upon their breaths, and with brave set smiles around their determined mouths.",1
1139,"As they approached the polls, glancing, like surrounded knights, for an embattled brother, the church women of the town, bent like huntresses above the straining leash, gave the word to the eager children of the Sunday schools. Dressed all in white, and clutching firmly in their small hands the tiny stems of American flags, the pigmies, monstrous as only children can be when they become the witless mouths of slogans and crusades, charged hungrily, uttering their shrill cries, upon their Gulliver. There he is, children. Go get him. Swirling around the marked man in wild elves' dance, they sang with piping empty violence:        ""We are some fond mother's treasure,       Men and women of to-morrow,       For a moment's empty pleasure       Would you give us lifelong sorrow?        Think of sisters, wives, and mothers,       Of helpless babes in some low slum,       Think not of yourself, but others,       Vote against the Demon Rum.",1
1140,"Eugene shuddered, and looked up at Gant's white emblem with coy pride. They walked happily by unhappy alcoholics, deltaed in foaming eddies of innocence, and smiling murderously down at some fond mother's treasure. If they were mine I'd warm their little tails, they thought-- privately.",1
1141,"Outside the corrugated walls of the warehouse, Gant paused for a moment to acknowledge the fervent congratulation of a group of ladies from the First Baptist Church: Mrs. Tarkinton, Mrs. Fagg Sluder, Mrs. C. M. McDonnel, and Mrs. W. H. (Pert) Pentland, who, heavily powdered, trailed her long skirt of gray silk with a musty rustle, and sneered elegantly down over her whaleboned collar. She was very fond of Gant.",1
1142,"Where's Will?"" he asked. Feathering the pockets of the licker interests, when he ought to be down here doing the Lord's Work,"" she replied with Christian bitterness. Nobody but you knows what I've had to put up with, Mr. Gant. You've had to put up with the queer Pentland streak, in your own home,"" she added with lucid significance.",1
1143,"He shook his head regretfully, and stared sorrowfully at the gutter. Ah, Lord, Pett! We've been through the mill--both of us. A smell of drying roots and sassafras twisted a sharp spiral from the warehouse into the thin slits of his nostrils.",1
1144,"When the time comes to speak up for the right,"" Pett announced to several of the ladies, ""you'll always find Will Gant ready to do his part. With far-seeing statesmanship he looked westward toward Pisgah. Licker,"" he said, ""is a curse and a care. It has caused the sufferings of untold millions--""  ""Amen, Amen,"" Mrs. Tarkinton chanted softly, swaying her wide hips rhythmically.",1
1145,"--it has brought poverty, disease, and suffering to hundreds of thousands of homes, broken the hearts of wives and mothers, and taken bread from the mouths of little orphaned children. Amen, brother. It has been,"" Gant began, but at this moment his uneasy eye lighted upon the broad red face of Tim O'Doyle and the fierce whiskered whiskiness of Major Ambrose Nethersole, two prominent publicans, who were standing near the entrance not six feet away and listening attentively.",1
1146,"Go on! Major Nethersole urged, with the deep chest notes of a bullfrog. Go on, W. O., but for God's sake, don't belch!""  ""Begod!"" said Tim O'Doyle, wiping a tiny rill of tobacco juice from the thick simian corner of his mouth, ""I've seen him start for the door and step through the windey.",1
1147,"When we see him coming we hire two extra bottle openers. He used to give the barman a bonus to get up early. Pay no attention to them, ladies, I beg of you,"" said Gant scathingly.",1
1148,"They are the lowest of the low, the whisky-besotted dregs of humanity, who deserve to bear not even the name of men, so far have they retrograded backwards. With a flourishing sweep of his slouch hat he departed into the warehouse. By God!"" said Ambrose Nethersole approvingly. It takes W. O. to tie a knot in the tail of the English language. It always did.",1
1149,"But within two months he moaned bitterly his unwetted thirst. For several years he ordered, from time to time, the alloted quota--a gallon of whisky every two weeks--from Baltimore. It was the day of the blind tiger. The town was mined thickly with them. Bad rye and moonshine corn were the prevailing beverages. He grew old, he was sick, he still drank.",1
1150,"A slow trickle of lust crawled painfully down the parched gulley of desire, and ended feebly in dry fumbling lechery. He made pretty young summer widows at Dixieland presents of money, underwear, and silk stockings, which he drew on over their shapely legs in the dusty gloom of his little office. Smiling with imperturbable tenderness, Mrs. Selborne thrust out her heavy legs slowly to swell with warm ripe smack his gift of flowered green-silk garters. Wetting his thumb with sly thin aftersmile, he told.",1
1151,"A grass widow, forty-nine, with piled hair of dyed henna, corseted breasts and hips architecturally protuberant in a sharp diagonal, meaty mottled arms, and a gulched face of leaden flaccidity puttied up brightly with cosmetics, rented the upstairs of Woodson Street while Helen was absent. She looks like an adventuress, hey?"" said Gant hopefully. She had a son. He was fourteen, with a round olive face, a soft white body, and thin legs. He bit his nails intently. His hair and eyes were dark, his face full of sad stealth. He was wise and made himself unobtrusively scarce at proper times.",1
1152,"Gant came home earlier. The widow rocked brightly on the porch. He bowed sweepingly, calling her Madam. Coy-kittenish, she talked down at him, slogged against the creaking stair rail. She leered cosily at him. She came and went freely through his sitting-room, where he now slept. One evening, just after he had entered, she came in from the bathroom, scented lightly with the best soap, and beefily moulded into a flame-red kimono.",1
1153,"A handsome woman yet, he thought. Good evening, madam. He got up from his rocker, put aside the crackling sheets of the evening paper (Republican), and undipped his steel-rimmed glasses from the great blade of his nose.",1
1154,"She came over with sprightly gait to the empty hearth, clasping her wrapper tightly with veinous hands. Swiftly, with a gay leer, she opened the garment, disclosing her thin legs, silkshod, and her lumpy hips, gaudily clothed in ruffled drawers of blue silk. Aren't they pretty? she twittered invitingly but obscurely. Then, as he took an eager stride forward, she skipped away like a ponderous maenad soliciting Bacchic pursuit.",1
1155,"A pair of pippins,"" he agreed, inclusively. After this, she prepared breakfast for him. From Dixieland, Eliza surveyed them with a bitter eye. He had no talent for concealment. His visits morning and evening were briefer, his tongue more benevolent.",1
1156,"I know what you're up to down there,"" she said. You needn't think I don't. He grinned sheepishly and wet his thumb.",1
1157,"Her mouth worked silently at attempted speech for a moment. She speared a frying steak and flipped it over on its raw back, smiling vengefully in a mounting column of greasy blue vapor. He poked her clumsily with his stiff fingers; she shrieked a protest mixed of anger and amusement, and moved awkwardly out of his reach with bridling gait.",1
1158,Get away! I don't want you round me! It's too late for that. She laughed with nagging mockery.,1
1159,"Don't you wish you could, though? I'll vow! she continued, kneading her lips for several seconds in an effort to speak. I'd be ashamed. Every one's laughing at you behind your back. You lie!",1
1160,"By God, you lie! he thundered magnificently, touched. Hammer-hurling Thor.",1
1161,"But he tired very quickly of his new love. He was weary, and frightened by his depletion. For a time he gave the widow small sums of money, and forgot the rent. He transferred to her his storming abuse, muttered ominously to himself in long aisle-pacings at his shop, when he saw that he had lost the ancient freedom of his house and saddled himself with a tyrannous hag. One evening he returned insanely drunk, routed her out of her chamber and pursued her unfrocked, untoothed, unputtied, with a fluttering length of kimono in her palsied hand, driving her finally into the yard beneath the big cherry tree, which he circled, howling, making frantic lunges for her as she twittered with fear, casting splintered glances all over the listening neighborhood as she put on the crumpled wrapper, hid partially the indecent jigging of her breasts, and implored succor. It did not come.",1
1162,"You bitch! he screamed. I'll kill you. You have drunk my heart's-blood, you have driven me to the brink of destruction, and you gloat upon my misery, listening with fiendish delight to my death-rattle, bloody and unnatural monster that you are. She kept the tree deftly between them and, when his attention was diverted for a moment to the flood of anathema, tore off on fear- quick feet, streetward to the haven of the Tarkintons' house.",1
1163,"As she rested there, in Mrs. Tarkinton's consolatory arms, weeping hysterically and dredging gullies in her poor painted face, they heard his chaotic footsteps blundering within his house, the heavy crash of furniture, and his fierce curses when he fell. He'll kill himself! He'll kill himself! she cried. He doesn't know what he's doing. Oh, my God! she wept. I've never been talked to that way by any man in my life! Gant fell heavily within his house.",1
1164,"There was silence. She rose fearfully. He's not a bad man,"" she whispered.",1
1165,"One morning in early summer, after Helen had returned, Eugene was wakened by scuffling feet and excited cries along the small boardwalk that skirted the house on its upper side and led to the playhouse, a musty little structure of pine with a single big room, which he could almost touch from the sloping roof that flowed about his gabled backroom window. The playhouse was another of the strange extravagancies of Gantian fancy: it had been built for the children when they were young. It had been for many years closed, it was a retreat of delight; its imprisoned air, stale and cool, was scented permanently with old pine boards, cased books, and dusty magazines.",1
1166,"For some weeks now it had been occupied by Mrs. Selborne's South Carolina cook, Annie, a plump comely negress of thirty-five, with a rich coppery skin. The woman had come into the mountains for the summer: she was a good cook and expected work at hotels or boarding-houses. Helen engaged her for five dollars a week. It was an act of pride.",1
1167,"That morning, Gant had wakened earlier and stared at his ceiling thoughtfully. He had risen, dressed, and wearing his leather slippers, walked softly back, along the boards, to the playhouse. Helen was roused by Annie's loud protests. Tingling with premonition she came down stairs, and found Gant wringing his hands and moaning as he walked up and down the washroom. Through the open doors she heard the negress complaining loudly to herself as she banged out drawers and slammed her belongings together.",1
1168,"I ain't used to no such goins-on. I'se a married woman, I is. I ain't goin' to say in dis house anothah minnit. Helen turned furiously upon Gant and shook him.",1
1169,"You rotten old thing, you! she cried. How dare you!""  ""Merciful God!",1
1170,"he whined, stamping his foot like a child, and pacing up and down. Why did this have to come upon me in my old age! He began to sniffle affectedly. Boo-hoo-hoo! O Jesus, it's fearful, it's awful, it's cruel that you should put this affliction on me. His contempt for reason was Parnassian. He accused God for exposing him; he wept because he had been caught.",1
1171,"Helen rushed out to the playhouse and with large gesture and hearty entreaty strove to appease outraged Annie. Come on, Annie,"" she coaxed. I'll give you a dollar a week more if you stay. Forget about it!""  ""No'm,"" said Annie stubbornly.",1
1172,I cain't stay heah any longer. I'se afraid of dat man. Gant paused in his distracted pacing from time to time long enough to cock an eager ear.,1
1173,"At each iteration of Annie's firm refusals, he fetched out a deep groan and took up his lament again. Luke, who had descended, had fidgeted about in a nervous prance from one large bare foot to another. Now he went to the door and looked out, bursting suddenly into a large Whah-Whah as he caught sight of the sullen respectability of the negress' expression. Helen came back into the house with an angry perturbed face.",1
1174,"She'll tell this all over town,"" she announced. Gant moaned in lengthy exhalations. Eugene, shocked at first, and frightened, flung madly across the kitchen linoleum in twisting leaps, falling catlike on his bare soles. He squealed ecstatically at Ben who loped in scowling, and began to snicker in short contemptuous fragments.",1
1175,"And of course she'll tell Mrs. Selborne all about it, as soon as she goes back to Henderson,"" Helen continued. O my God! Gant whined, ""why was this put on me--""  ""O gotohell!",1
1176,"Gotohell! she said comically, her wrath loosened suddenly by a ribald and exasperated smile. They howled.",1
1177,"I shall dy-ee. Eugene choked in faint hiccoughs and began to slide gently down the kitchen-washroom door jamb. Ah! you little idiot! Ben snarled, lifting his white hand sharply. He turned away quickly with a flickering smile.",1
1178,"At this moment, Annie appeared on the walk outside the door, with a face full of grieved decorum. Luke looked nervously and gravely from his father to the negress, fidgeting from one big foot to the other. I'se a married woman,"" said Annie. I ain't used to nothin' like dis. I wants my money. Luke blew up in an explosion of wild laughter.",1
1179,"Whah-whah! He pronged her larded ribs with scooped fingers. She moved away angrily, muttering.",1
1180,"Eugene lolled about feebly on the floor, kicking one leg out gently as if he had just been decapitated, and fumbling blindly at the neckband of his nightshirt. A faint clucking sound came at intervals from his wide-open mouth. They laughed wildly, helplessly, draining into mad laughter all the welled and agglutinated hysteria that had gathered in them, washing out in a moment of fierce surrender all the fear and fatality of their lives, the pain of age and death.",1
1181,"Dying, he walked among them, whining his lament against God's lidless stare, gauging their laughter cautiously with uneasy prying eyes, a faint tickled grin playing craftily about his wailing mouth. Roofing the deep tides, swinging in their embrace, rocked Eliza's life Sargassic, as when, at morning, a breath of kitchen air squirmed through her guarded crack of door, and fanned the pendant clusters of old string in floating rhythm. She rubbed the sleep gently from her small weak eyes, smiling dimly as she thought, unwakened, of ancient losses. Her worn fingers still groped softly in the bed beside her, and when she found it vacant, she awoke. Remembered. My youngest, my oldest, final bitter fruit, O dark of soul, O far and lonely, where? Remembered O his face! Death-son, partner of my peril, last coinage of my flesh, who warmed my flanks and nestled to my back. Gone?  Cut off from me? When? Where?",1
1182,"The screen slammed, the market boy dumped ground sausage on the table, a negress fumbled at the stove. Awake now. Ben moved quietly, but not stealthily, about, confessing and denying nothing. His thin laughter pierced the darkness softly above the droning creak of the wooden porch-swing. Mrs. Pert laughed gently, comfortingly. She was forty-three: a large woman of gentle manners, who drank a great deal. When she was drunk, her voice was soft, low, and fuzzy, she laughed uncertainly, mildly, and walked with careful alcoholic gravity. She dressed well: she was well fleshed, but not sensual-looking. She had good features, soft oaken hair, blue eyes, a little bleared. She laughed with a comfortable, happy chuckle. They were all very fond of her. Helen called her ""Fatty. Her husband was a drug salesman: he travelled through Tennessee, Arkansas, and Mississippi, and returned to Altamont for a fortnight every four months.",1
1183,"Her daughter, Catherine, who was almost Ben's age, came to Dixieland for a few weeks each summer. She was a school-teacher in a public school in a Tennessee village. Ben squired both.",1
1184,"Mrs. Pert chuckled softly when she spoke to him, and called him ""Old Ben. In the darkness he sat, talking a little, humming a little, laughing occasionally in his thin minor key, quietly, with a cigarette between his forked ivory fingers, drawing deeply. He would buy a flask of whisky and they would drink it very quietly. Perhaps they talked a little more. But they were never riotous. Occasionally, they would rise at midnight from the swing, and go out into the street, departing under leafy trees. They would not return during the night. Eliza, ironing out a great pile of rumpled laundry in the kitchen, would listen. Presently, she would mount the stairs, peer carefully into Mrs. Pert's room, and descend, her lips thoughtfully kneaded.",1
1185,She had to speak these things to Helen. There was a strange defiant communion between them. They laughed or were bitter together.,1
1186,"Why, of course,"" said Helen, impatiently, ""I've known it all along. But she looked beyond the door curiously, her big gold- laced teeth half-shown in her open mouth, the child look of belief, wonder, skepticism, and hurt innocency in her big highboned face. Do you suppose he really does? Oh surely not mama. She's old enough to be his mother. Across Eliza's white puckered face, thoughtful and reproving, a sly smile broke.",1
1187,"She rubbed her finger under the broad wings of her nose to conceal it, and snickered. I tell you what! she said. He's a chip off the old block. His father over again,"" she whispered. It's in the blood. Helen laughed huskily, picking vaguely at her chin, and gazing out across the weedy garden.",1
1188,"Poor old Ben! she said, and her eyes, she did not know why, were sheeted with tears. Well, 'Fatty's' a lady. I like her--I don't care who knows it,"" she added defiantly. It's their business anyway. They're quiet about it. You've got to say that much for them. She was silent a moment.",1
1189,"Women are crazy about him,"" she said. They like the quiet ones, don't they? He's a gentleman. Eliza shook her head portentously for several moments.",1
1190,"What do you think! she whispered, and shook her pursed lips again. Always ten years older at least.""  ""Poor old Ben!",1
1191,"Helen said again. The quiet one, the sad one. I tell you what! Eliza shook her head, unable to speak. Her eyes too were wet.",1
1192,"They thought of sons and lovers: they drew closer in their communion, they drank the cup of their twin slavery as they thought of the Gant men who would always know hunger, the strangers on the land, the unknown farers who had lost their way. O lost! The hands of women were hungry for his crisp hair. When they came to the paper office to insert advertisements they asked for him. Frowning gravely, he leaned upon the counter with feet crossed, reading, in a somewhat illiterate monotone, what they had written. His thin hairy wrists slatted leanly against his starched white cuffs, his strong nervous fingers, ivoried by nicotine, smoothed out the crumples. Scowling intently, he bent his fine head, erasing, arranging. Emphatic lady-fingers twitched. How's that?"" Answers vague-voiced, eyes tangled in crisp hair. Oh, much better, thank you. Wanted: frowning boy-man head for understanding fingers of mature and sympathetic woman.",1
1193,"Unhappily married. Address Mrs. B. J. X., Box 74. Eight cents a word for one insertion. Oh, [tenderly] thank you, Ben.""  ""Ben,"" said Jack Eaton, the advertising manager, thrusting his plump face into the city editor's office, ""one of your harem's out there.",1
1194,"She wanted to murder me when I tried to take it. See if she's got a friend. Oh, listen to this, won't you?",1
1195,"Ben snickered fiercely to the City Editor. You missed your calling, Eaton. What you want is the endman's job with Honeyboy Evans. Scowling, he cast the cigarette from his ivory hand, and loped out into the office.",1
1196,"Eaton remained a moment to laugh with the City Editor. O rare Ben Gant! Sometimes, returning late at night to Woodson Street, in the crowded summer season, he slept with Eugene in the front room upstairs where they had all been born. Propped high on pillows in the old cream-colored bed, painted gaily at head and foot with round medals of clustering fruit, he read aloud in a quiet puzzled voice, fumbling over pronunciation, the baseball stories of Ring Lardner. You know me, Al. Just outside the windows the flat veranda roof was still warm from its daytime exhalations of tar- calked tin. Rich cob-webbed grapes hung in packed clusters among the broad leaves. I didn't raise my boy to be a southpaw. I've a good mind to give Gleason a sock in the eye. Ben read painfully, pausing a moment later to snicker.",1
1197,"Thus, like a child, he groped intently at all meanings, with scowling studiousness. Women liked to see him scowl and study so. He was sudden only in anger, and in his quick communications with his angel.",1
1198,"22   Toward the beginning of Eugene's fourteenth year, when he had been a student at Leonard's for two years, Ben got work for him as a paper carrier. Eliza grumbled at the boy's laziness. She complained that she could get him to do little or nothing for her. In fact, he was not lazy, but he hated all the dreariness of boarding-house routine. Her demands on him were not heavy, but they were frequent and unexpected. He was depressed at the uselessness of effort in Dixieland, at the total erasure of all daily labor. If she had given him position, the daily responsibility of an ordered task, he could have fulfilled it with zeal. But her own method was much too random: she wanted to keep him on tap for an occasional errand, and he did not have her interest.",1
1199,"Dixieland was the heart of her life. It owned her. It appalled him. When she sent him to the grocer's for bread, he felt wearily that the bread would be eaten by strangers, that nothing out of the effort of their lives grew younger, better, or more beautiful, that all was erased in a daily wash of sewage. She sent him forth in the rank thicket of her garden to hoe out the swarming weeds that clustered about her vegetables, which flourished, as did all the earth, under her careless touch. He knew, as he chopped down in a weary frenzy, that the weeds would grow again in the hot sun- stench, that her vegetables--weeded or not--would grow fat and be fed to her boarders, and that her life, hers alone, would endure to something. As he looked at her, he felt the weariness and horror of time: all but her must die in a smothering Sargasso. Thus, flailing the clotted earth drunkenly, he would be brought to suddenly by her piercing scream from the high back porch, and realize that he had destroyed totally a row of young bladed corn.",1
1200,"Why, what on earth, boy! she fretted angrily, peering down at him through a shelving confusion of wash-tubs, limp drying stockings, empty milk-bottles, murky and unwashed, and rusty lard-buckets. I'll vow! she said, turning to Mr. Baskett, the Hattiesburg cotton merchant, who grinned down malarially through his scraggly mustaches, ""what am I going to do with him? He's chopped down every stock of corn in the row. Yes,"" Mr. Baskett said, peering over, ""and missed every weed.",1
1201,"Boy,"" he added judicially, ""you need two months on a farm. The bread that I fetch will be eaten by strangers. I carry coal and split up wood for fires to warm them. Smoke. Fuimas fumus. All of our life goes up in smoke. There is no structure, no creation in it, not even the smoky structure of dreams. Come lower, angel; whisper in our ears. We are passing away in smoke and there is nothing to-day but weariness to pay for yesterday's toil. How may we save ourselves?",1
1202,"He was given the Niggertown route--the hardest and least profitable of all. He was paid two cents a copy for weekly deliveries, given ten per cent of his weekly collections, and ten cents for every new subscription. Thus, he was able to earn four or five dollars a week. His thin undeveloped body drank sleep with insatiable thirst, but it was now necessary for him to get up at half-past three in the morning with darkness and silence making an unreal humming in his drugged ears.",1
1203,"Strange aerial music came fluting out of darkness, or over his slow-wakening senses swept the great waves of symphonic orchestration. Fiend-voices, beautiful and sleep-loud, called down through darkness and light, developing the thread of ancient memory. Staggering blindly in the whitewashed glare, his eyes, sleep-corded opened slowly as he was born anew, umbilically cut, from darkness.",1
1204,"Waken, ghost-eared boy, but into darkness. Waken, phantom, O into us. Try, try, O try the way. Open the wall of light. Ghost, ghost, who is the ghost? O lost. Ghost, ghost, who is the ghost? O whisper-tongued laughter. Eugene! Eugene! Here, O here, Eugene. Here, Eugene. The way is here, Eugene. Have you forgotten? The leaf, the rock, the wall of light. Lift up the rock, Eugene, the leaf, the stone, the unfound door. Return, return.",1
1205,"A voice, sleep-strange and loud, forever far-near, spoke. Eugene!  Spoke, ceased, continued without speaking, to speak. In him spoke. Where darkness, son, is light. Try, boy, the word you know remember. In the beginning was the logos. Over the border the borderless green-forested land. Yesterday, remember?  Far-forested, a horn-note wound.",1
1206,"Sea-forested, water-far, the grotted coral sea-far horn-note. The pillioned ladies witch-faced in bottle-green robes saddle-swinging. Merwomen unsealed and lovely in sea-floor colonnades. The hidden land below the rock. The flitting wood-girls growing into bark. Far-faint, as he wakened, they besought him with lessening whir. Then deeper song, fiend-throated, wind-shod. Brother, O brother! They shot down the brink of darkness, gone on the wind like bullets. O lost, and by the wind grieved, ghost, come back again.",1
1207,"He dressed and descended the stairs gently to the back porch. The cool air, charged with blue starlight, shocked his body into wakefulness, but as he walked townward up the silent streets, the strange ringing in his ears persisted. He listened like his own ghost, to his footsteps, heard from afar the winking flicker of the street-lamps, saw, from sea-sunk eyes, the town.",1
1208,"There sounded in his heart a solemn music. It filled the earth, the air, the universe; it was not loud, but it was omnipresent, and it spoke to him of death and darkness, and of the focal march of all who lived or had lived, converging on a plain. The world was filled with silent marching men: no word was spoken, but in the heart of each there was a common knowledge, the word that all men knew and had forgotten, the lost key opening the prison gates, the lane-end into heaven, and as the music soared and filled him, he cried: I will remember. When I come to the place, I shall know. Hot bands of light streamed murkily from the doors and windows of the office.",1
1209,"From the press-room downstairs there was an ascending roar as the big press mounted to its capacity. As he entered the office and drank in the warm tides of steel and ink that soaked the air, he awoke suddenly, his light-drugged limbs solidifying with a quick shock, as would some aerial spirit, whose floating body corporealizes the instant it touches earth. The carriers, waiting in a boisterous line, filed up to the circulation manager's desk, depositing their collections, cold handfuls of greasy coin. Seated beneath a green-shaded light, he ran swiftly down their books, totalling up their figures and counting nickels, dimes, and pennies into little spooned trays of a drawer. Then he gave to each a scrawled order for his morning quota.",1
1210,"They ran downstairs, eager as whippets to be off, brandishing their slips at a sullen counter whose black fingers galloped accurately across the stiff ridges of a great sheaf. He allowed them two ""extras. If the carrier was not scrupulous, he increased his number of spare copies by keeping on his book the names of a half- dozen discontinued subscribers. These surplus copies were always good for coffee and pie with the lunchman, or as tribute to a favorite policeman, fireman, or motorman.",1
1211,"In the press-pit Harry Tugman loafed under their stare comfortably, a fat trickle of cigarette smoke coiling from his nostrils. He glanced over the press with professional carelessness, displaying his powerful chest with its thick bush, which lay a dark blot under his sweat-wet under-shirt. An assistant pressman climbed nimbly among roaring pistons and cylinders, an oil-can and a bunch of waste in his hand. A broad river of white paper rushed constantly up from the cylinder and leaped into a mangling chaos of machinery whence it emerged a second later, cut, printed, folded and stacked, sliding along a board with a hundred others in a fattening sheaf.",1
1212,"Machine-magic! Why not men, like that? Doctor, surgeon, poet, priest--stacked, folded, printed.",1
1213,"Harry Tugman cast away his wet fragment of cigarette with a luxurious grimace. The carriers eyed him reverently. Once he had knocked a sub-pressman down for sitting in his chair. He was Boss. He got $55 a week. If he was not pleased he could get work at any time on the New Orleans Times-Picayune, the Louisville Courier Journal, the Atlanta Constitution, the Knoxville Sentinel, the Norfolk Pilot. He could travel.",1
1214,"In a moment more they were out on the streets, hobbling along rapidly under the accustomed weight of the crammed canvas bags. He was most desperately afraid of failure. He listened with constricted face to Eliza's admonition.",1
1215,"Spruce up, boy!  Spruce up! Make them think you are somebody! He had little confidence in himself; he recoiled in advance from the humiliation of dismissal. He feared the sabre-cut of language, and before his own pride he drew back and was afraid.",1
1216,"For three mornings he accompanied the retiring carrier, gathering his mind to focal intensity while he tried to memorize each stereotyped movement of the delivery, tracing again and again the labyrinthine web of Niggertown, wreaking his plan out among the sprawled chaos of clay and slime, making incandescent those houses to which a paper was delivered, and forgetting the others. Years later, alone in darkness, when he had forgotten the twisted anarchy of that pattern, he still remembered a corner where he left his bag while he climbed a spur of hill, a bank down which he clambered to three rotting shacks, a high porched house into which accurately he shot his folded block of news. The retiring carrier was a robust country boy of seventeen who had been given better employment at the paper office. His name was Jennings Ware. He was tough, good-humored, a little cynical, and he smoked a great many cigarettes. He was clothed in vitality and comfort. He taught his pupil when and where to expect the prying face of ""Foxy,"" how to escape discovery under the lunchroom counter, and how to fold a paper and throw it with the speed and accuracy of a ball.",1
1217,"In the fresh pre-natal morning they began their route, walking down the steep hill of Valley Street into tropical sleep, past the stabled torpor of black sleepers, past all the illicit loves, the casual and innumerable adulteries of Niggertown. As the stiff block of paper thudded sharply on the flimsy porch of a shack, or smacked the loose boarding of a door, they were answered by a long sullen moan of discontent. They sniggered.",1
1218,"Check this one off,"" said Jennings Ware, ""if you can't collect next time. She owes for six weeks now. This one,"" he said, flipping a paper quietly on a door mat, ""is good pay.",1
1219,"They're good niggers. You'll get your money every Wednesday. There's a High Yaller in here,"" he said, hurling the paper against the door with a whizzing smack and smiling, as a young full-meated woman's yell of indignation answered, a thin devil's grin.",1
1220,"You can have that if you want it. A wan smile of fear struggled across Eugene's mouth. Jennings Ware looked at him shrewdly, but did not press him. Jennings Ware was a good-hearted boy.",1
1221,"She's a pretty good old girl,"" he said. You've got a right to a few dead-heads. Take it out in trade. They walked on down the dark unpaved street, folding papers rapidly during the intervals between delivery.",1
1222,"It's a hell of a route,"" said Jennings Ware. When it rains it's terrible. You'll go into mud up to your knees. And you can't collect from half the bastards. He hurled a paper viciously.",1
1223,"But, oh man,"" he said, after a moment. If you want Jelly Roll you've come to the right place. I ain't kidding you!""  ""With--with niggers?",1
1224,"Eugene whispered, moistening his dry lips. Jennings Ware turned his red satirical face on him. You don't see any Society Belles around here, do you?"" he said.",1
1225,Are niggers good? Eugene asked in a small dry voice. Boy! The word blew out of Jennings Ware's mouth like an explosion. He was silent a moment.,1
1226,"There ain't nothing better,"" he said. At first, the canvas strap of the paper-bag bit cruelly across his slender shoulders. He strained against the galling weight that pulled him earthwards. The first weeks were like a warring nightmare: day after day he fought his way up to liberation. He knew all the sorrow of those who carry weight; he knew, morning by morning, the aerial ecstasy of release. As his load lightened with the progress of his route, his leaning shoulder rose with winged buoyancy, his straining limbs grew light: at the end of his labor his flesh, touched sensuously by fatigue, bounded lightly from the earth. He was Mercury chained by fardels, Ariel bent beneath a pack: freed, his wingshod feet trod brightness. He sailed in air. The rapier stars glinted upon his serfdom: dawn reddened on release. He was like a sailor drowned within the hold, who gropes to life and morning through a hatch; a diver twined desperately in octopal feelers, who cuts himself from death and mounts slowly from the sea-floor into light.",1
1227,"Within a month a thick hummock of muscle hardened on his shoulder: he bent jubilantly into his work. He had now no fear of failure. His heart lifted like a proud crested cock. He had been dropped among others without favor, and he surpassed them. He was a lord of darkness; he exulted in the lonely sufficiency of his work. He walked into the sprawled chaos of the settlement, the rifleman of news for sleeping men. His fast hands blocked the crackling sheet, he swung his lean arm like a whip. He saw the pale stars drown, and ragged light break open on the hills. Alone, the only man alive, he began the day for men, as he walked by the shuttered windows and heard the long denned snore of the tropics. He walked amid this close thick sleep, hearing again the ghostly ring of his own feet, and the vast orchestral music of darkness. As the gray tide of morning surged westward he awoke.",1
1228,"And Eugene watched the slow fusion of the seasons; he saw the royal processional of the months; he saw the summer light eat like a river into dark; he saw dark triumph once again; and he saw the minute-winning days, like flies, buzz home to death. In summer, full day had come before he finished: he walked home in a world of wakenings. The first cars were grouped on the Square as he passed, their new green paint giving them the pleasant appearance of fresh toys. The huge battered cans of the milkmen glinted cleanly in the sun. Light fell hopefuly upon the swarthy greasiness of George Chakales, nightman of the Athens Cafe. The Hellenic Dawn. And in Uneeda No. 1, upon the Square, Eugene sat, washing an egg-sandwich down with long swallows of pungent coffee, stooled in a friendly company of motormen, policemen, chauffeurs, plasterers, and masons. It was very pleasant, he felt, to complete one's work when all the world was beginning theirs. He went home under singing trees of birds.",1
1229,"In autumn, a late red moon rode low in the skies till morning. The air was filled with dropping leaves, there was a solemn thunder of great trees upon the hills; sad phantasmal whisperings and the vast cathedral music deepened in his heart. In winter, he went down joyously into the dark howling wind, leaning his weight upon its advancing wall as it swept up a hill; and when in early Spring the small cold rain fell from the reeking sky he was content. He was alone.",1
1230,"He harried his deficient subscribers for payment, with a wild tenacity. He accepted their easy promises without question; he hunted them down in their own rooms, or in the rooms of a neighbor, he pressed so doggedly that, at length, sullenly or good-humoredly, they paid a part of their debt. This was more than any of his predecessors had accomplished, but he fretted nervously over his accounts until he found that he had become, for the circulation manager, the exemplar for indolent boys. As he dumped his desperately gathered pile of ""chicken feed"" upon the man's desk, his employer would turn accusingly to a delinquent boy, saying:  ""Look at that!",1
1231,"He does it every week! Niggers, too! His pallid face would flame with joy and pride. When he spoke to the great man his voice trembled. He could hardly speak.",1
1232,"As the wind yelled through the dark, he burst into maniacal laughter. He leaped high into the air with a scream of insane exultancy, burred in his throat idiot animal-squeals, and shot his papers terrifically into the flimsy boarding of the shacks. He was free. He was alone. He heard the howl of a train-whistle, and it was not so far away. In the darkness he flung his arm out to the man on the rails, his goggled brother with steel-steady rail-fixed eyes.",1
1233,"He did not shrink so much, beneath the menace of the family fist. He was more happily unmindful of his own unworthiness. Assembled with three or four of the carriers in the lunchroom, he learned to smoke: in the sweet blue air of Spring, as he sloped down to his route, he came to know the beauty of Lady Nicotine, the delectable wraith who coiled into his brain, left her poignant breath in his young nostrils, her sharp kiss upon his mouth.",1
1234,"He was a sharp blade. The Spring drove a thorn into his heart, it drew a wild cry from his lips. For it, he had no speech.",1
1235,"He knew hunger. He knew thirst. A great flame rose in him. He cooled his hot face in the night by bubbling water jets. Alone, he wept sometimes with pain and ecstasy. At home the frightened silence of his childhood was now touched with savage restraint. He was wired like a race-horse. A white atom of inchoate fury would burst in him like a rocket, and for a moment he would be cursing mad.",1
1236,"What's wrong with him? Is it the Pentland crazy streak coming out? Helen asked, seated in Eliza's kitchen.",1
1237,"Eliza moulded her lips portentously for some time, shaking her head slowly. Why,"" she said, with a cunning smile, ""don't you know, child?""  His need for the negroes had become acute. He spent his afternoons after school combing restlessly through the celled hive of Niggertown. The rank stench of the branch, pouring its thick brown sewage down a bed of worn boulders, the smell of wood-smoke and laundry stewing in a black iron yard-pot, and the low jungle cadences of dusk, the forms that slid, dropped, and vanished, beneath a twinkling orchestration of small sounds. Fat ropes of language in the dusk, the larded sizzle of frying fish, the sad faint twanging of a banjo, and the stamp, far-faint, of heavy feet; voices Nilotic, river-wailing, and the greasy light of four thousand smoky lamps in shack and tenement.",1
1238,"From the worn central butte round which the colony swarmed, the panting voices of the Calvary Baptist Church mounted, in an exhausting and unceasing frenzy, from seven o'clock until two in the morning, in their wild jungle wail of sin and love and death. The dark was hived with flesh and mystery. Rich wells of laughter bubbled everywhere. The catforms slid. Everything was immanent. Everything was far. Nothing could be touched.",1
1239,"In this old witch-magic of the dark, he began to know the awful innocence of evil, the terrible youth of an ancient race; his lips slid back across his teeth, he prowled in darkness with loose swinging arms, and his eyes shone. Shame and terror, indefinable, surged through him. He could not face the question in his heart.",1
1240,"A good part of his subscription list was solidly founded among decent and laborious darkies--barbers, tailors, grocers, pharmacists, and ginghamed black housewives, who paid him promptly on a given day each week, greeting him with warm smiles full of teeth, and titles of respect extravagant and kindly:  ""Mister,"" ""Colonel,"" ""General,"" ""Governor,"" and so on. They all knew Gant. But another part--the part in which his desire and wonder met--were ""floaters,"" young men and women of precarious means, variable lives, who slid mysteriously from cell to cell, who peopled the night with their flitting stealth. He sought these phantoms fruitlessly for weeks, until he discovered that he might find them only on Sunday morning, tossed like heavy sacks across one another, in the fetid dark of a tenement room, a half-dozen young men and women, in a snoring exhaustion of whisky-stupor and sexual depletion.",1
1241,"One Saturday evening, in the fading red of a summer twilight, he returned to one of these tenements, a rickety three-story shack, that cropped its two lower floors down a tall clay bank at the western ledge, near the whites. Two dozen men and women lived here. He was on the search for a woman named Ella Corpening. He had never been able to find her: she was weeks behind in her subscriptions. But her door stood open to-night: a warm waft of air and cooking food came up to him. He descended the rotten steps that climbed the bank.",1
1242,"Ella Corpening sat facing the door in a rocking chair, purring lazily in the red glow of a little kitchen range, with her big legs stretched comfortably out on the floor. She was a mulatto of twenty-six years, a handsome woman of Amazonian proportions, with smooth tawny skin. She was dressed in the garments of some former mistress: she wore a brown woollen skirt, patent-leather shoes with high suede tops pearl-buttoned, and gray silk hose. Her long heavy arms shone darkly through the light texture of a freshly laundered white shirtwaist. A lacing of cheap blue ribbon gleamed across the heavy curve of her breasts.",1
1243,"There was a bubbling pot of cabbage and sliced fat pork upon the stove. Paper boy,"" said Eugene. Come to collect. Is you de boy?",1
1244,"drawled Ella Corpening with a lazy movement of her arm. How much does I owe?""  ""$1.20,"" he answered. He looked meaningfully at one extended leg, where, thrust in below the knee, a wadded bank-note gleamed dully.",1
1245,"Dat's my rent money,"" she said. Can't give you dat. Dollah- twenty! She brooded. Uh!  Uh! she grunted pleasantly. Don't seem lak it ought to be dat much. It is, though,"" he said, opening his account book.",1
1246,"It mus' is,"" she agreed, ""if de book say so. She meditated luxuriously for a moment. Does you collec' Sunday mawnin'? she asked.",1
1247,"Yes,"" he said. You come roun' in de mawnin',"" she said hopefully. I'll have somethin' fo' yuh, sho. I'se waitin' fo' a white gent'man now. He's goin' gib me a dollah. She moved her great limbs slowly, and smiled at him.",1
1248,"Forked pulses beat against his eyes. He gulped dryly: his legs were rotten with excitement. What's--what's he going to give you a dollar for?"" he muttered, barely audible.",1
1249,"Jelly Roll,"" said Ella Corpening. He moved his lips twice, unable to speak. She got up from her chair.",1
1250,"What yo' want? she asked softly. Jelly Roll?""  ""Want to see--to see!",1
1251,he gasped. She closed the door opening on the bank and locked it. The stove cast a grated glow from its open ashpan. There was a momentary rain of red cinders into the pit.,1
1252,"Ella Corpening opened the door beyond that, leading to another room. There were two dirty rumpled beds; the single window was bolted and covered by an old green shade. She lit a smoky little lamp, and turned the wick low.",1
1253,"There was a battered little dresser with a mottled glass, from which the blistered varnish was flaking. Over the screened hearth, on a low mantel, there was a Kewpie doll, sashed with pink ribbon, a vase with fluted edges and gilt flowers, won at a carnival, and a paper of pins. A calendar, also, by courtesy of the Altamont Coal and Ice Company, showing an Indian maid paddling her canoe down an alley of paved moonlight, and a religious motto in flowered scrollwork, framed in walnut:  God Loves Them Both.",1
1254,"What yo' want? she whispered, facing him. Far off, he listened to the ghost of his own voice.",1
1255,"Take off your clothes. Her skirt fell in a ring about her feet. She took off her starched waist. In a moment, save for her hose, she stood naked before him.",1
1256,"Her breath came quickly, her full tongue licked across her mouth. Dance! he cried. Dance!""  She began to moan softly, while an undulant tremor flowed through her great yellow body; her hips and her round heavy breasts writhed slowly in a sensual rhythm.",1
1257,"Her straight oiled hair fell across her neck in a thick shock. She extended her arms for balance, the lids closed over her large yellow eyeballs. She came near him. He felt her hot breath on his face, the smothering flood of her breasts. He was whirled like a chip in the wild torrent of her passion. Her powerful yellow hands gripped his slender arms round like bracelets. She shook him to and fro slowly, fastening him tightly against her pelt.",1
1258,"He strained back desperately against the door, drowning in her embrace. Get-'way nigger. Get-'way,"" he panted thickly.",1
1259,"Slowly she released him: without opening her eyes, moaning, she slid back as if he had been a young tree. She sang, in a wailing minor key, with unceasing iteration:        ""Jelly Roll! Je-e-e-ly Roll!""--   her voice falling each time to a low moan.",1
1260,"Her face, the broad column of her throat, and her deep-breasted torso were rilled with sweat. He fumbled blindly for the door, lunged across the outer room and, gasping, found his way into the air. Her chant, unbroken and undisturbed by his departure, followed him up the flimsy steps. He did not pause to get his breath until he came to the edge of the market square. Below him in the valley, across on the butte, the smoky lamps of Niggertown flared in the dusk. Faint laughter, rich, jungle-wild, welled up from hived darkness. He heard lost twangling notes, the measured thump of distant feet; beyond, above, more thin, more far than all, the rapid wail of sinners in a church.",1
1261,"23   [Greek text]   He did not tell the Leonards that he was working in the early morning. He knew they would oppose his employment, and that their opposition would manifest itself in the triumphant argument of lowered grades. Also, Margaret Leonard, he knew, would talk ominously of health undermined, of the promise of future years destroyed, of the sweet lost hours of morning sleep that could never be regained. He was really more robust now than he had ever been. He was heavier and stronger. But he sometimes felt a gnawing hunger for sleep: he grew heavy at mid-day, revived in the afternoon, but found it difficult to keep his sleepy brain fixed on a book after eight o'clock in the evening.",1
1262,"He learned little of discipline. Under the care of the Leonards he came even to have a romantic contempt for it. Margaret Leonard had the marvelous vision, of great people, for essences. She saw always the dominant color, but she did not always see the shadings. She was an inspired sentimentalist. She thought she ""knew boys"": she was proud of her knowledge of them. In fact, however, she had little knowledge of them. She would have been stricken with horror if she could have known the wild confusion of adolescence, the sexual nightmares of puberty, the grief, the fear, the shame in which a boy broods over the dark world of his desire. She did not know that every boy, caged in from confession by his fear, is to himself a monster.",1
1263,"She did not have knowledge. But she had wisdom. She found immediately a person's quality. Boys were her heroes, her little gods. She believed that the world was to be saved, life redeemed, by one of them. She saw the flame that burns in each of them, and she guarded it. She tried somehow to reach the dark gropings toward light and articulation, of the blunt, the stolid, the shamefast. She spoke a calm low word to the trembling racehorse, and he was still.",1
1264,"Thus, he made no confessions. He was still prison-pent. But he turned always to Margaret Leonard as toward the light: she saw the unholy fires that cast their sword-dance on his face, she saw the hunger and the pain, and she fed him--majestic crime!--on poetry.",1
1265,"Whatever of fear or shame locked them in careful silence, whatever decorous pretense of custom guarded their tongues, they found release in the eloquent symbols of verse. And by that sign, Margaret was lost to the good angels. For what care the ambassadors of Satan, for all the small fidelities of the letter and the word, if from the singing choir of earthly methodism we can steal a single heart--lift up, flame-tipped, one great lost soul to the high sinfulness of poetry?",1
1266,"The wine of the grape had never stained her mouth, but the wine of poetry was inextinguishably mixed with her blood, entombed in her flesh. By the beginning of his fifteenth year Eugene knew almost every major lyric in the language. He possessed them to their living core, not in a handful of scattered quotations, but almost line for line. His thirst was drunken, insatiate: he added to his hoard entire scenes from Schiller's Wilhelm Tell, which he read by himself in German; the lyrics of Heine, and several folk songs. He committed to memory the entire passage in the Anabasis, the mounting and triumphal Greek which described the moment when the starving remnant of the Ten Thousand had come at length to the sea, and sent up their great cry, calling it by name. In addition, he memorized some of the sonorous stupidities of Cicero, because of the sound, and a little of Caesar, terse and lean.",1
1267,"The great lyrics of Burns he knew from music, from reading, or from hearing Gant recite them. But ""Tam O'Shanter"" Margaret Leonard read to him, her eyes sparkling with laughter as she read:        ""In hell they'll roast thee like a herrin'. The shorter Wordsworth pieces he had read at grammar school.",1
1268,"My heart leaps up,"" ""I wandered lonely as a cloud,"" and ""Behold her, single in the field,"" he had known for years; but Margaret read him the sonnets and made him commit ""The world is too much with us"" to memory. Her voice trembled and grew low with passion when she read it. He knew all the songs in Shakespeare's plays, but the two that moved him most were:  ""O mistress mine, where are you roaming?"" which blew a far horn in his heart, and the great song from Cymbeline:  ""Fear no more the heat o' the sun. He had tried to read all the sonnets, and failed, because their woven density was too much for his experience, but he had read, and forgotten, perhaps half of them, and remembered a few which burned up from the page, strangely, immediately, like lamps for him.",1
1269,"Those that he knew were:  ""When, in the chronicle of wasted time,"" ""To me, fair friend, you never can be old,"" ""Let me not to the marriage of true minds,"" ""The expense of spirit in a waste of shame,"" ""When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,"" ""Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? From you have I been absent in the spring,"" and ""That time of year thou mayest in me behold,"" the greatest of all, which Margaret brought him to, and which shot through him with such electric ecstasy when he came to ""Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang,"" that he could hardly hold his course unbroken through the rest of it. He read all the plays save Timon, Titus Andronicus, Coriolanus, and King John, but the only play that held his interest from first to last was King Lear. With most of the famous declamatory passages he had been familiar, for years, by Gant's recitation, and now they wearied him. And all the wordy pinwheels of the clowns, which Margaret laughed at dutifully, and exhibited as specimens of the master's swingeing wit, he felt vaguely were very dull. He never had any confidence in Shakespeare's humor--his Touchstones were not only windy fools, but dull ones.",1
1270,"For my part I had rather bear with you than bear you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you, for I think you have no money in your purse. This sort of thing reminded him unpleasantly of the Pentlands. The Fool in ""Lear"" alone he thought admirable--a sad, tragic, mysterious fool. For the rest, he went about and composed parodies, which, with a devil's grin, he told himself would split the sides of posterity. Such as:  ""Aye, nuncle, an if Shrove Tuesday come last Wednesday, I'll do the capon to thy cock, as Tom O'Ludgate told the shepherd when he found the cowslips gone. Dost bay with two throats, Cerberus? Down, boy, down!",1
1271,"The admired beauties he was often tired of, perhaps because he had heard them so often, and it seemed to him, moreover, that Shakespeare often spoke absurdly and pompously when he might better have spoken simply, as in the scene where, being informed by the Queen of the death of his sister by drowning, Laertes says:        ""Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia, And therefore I forbid my tears. You really can't beat that (he thought).",1
1272,"Aye, Ben! Would he had blotted a hundred! A thousand!",1
1273,"But he was deep in other passages which the elocutionist misses, such as the terrible and epic invocation of Edmund, in King Lear, drenched in evil, which begins:        ""Thou, Nature, art my goddess,""   and ends,        ""Now, gods, stand up for bastards. It was as dark as night, as evil as Niggertown, as vast as the elemental winds that howled down across the hills: he chanted it in the black hours of his labor, into the dark and the wind. He understood; he exulted in its evil--which was the evil of earth, of illicit nature. It was a call to the unclassed; it was a cry for those beyond the fence, for rebel angels, and for all of the men who are too tall.",1
1274,"He knew nothing of the Elizabethan drama beyond Shakespeare's plays. But he very early came to know a little of the poetry of Ben Jonson, whom Margaret looked on as a literary Falstaff, condoning, with the familiar weakness of the schoolmarm, his Gargantuan excess as a pardonable whimsy of genius. She was somewhat academically mirthful over the literary bacchanalia, as a professor in a Baptist college smacks his lips appetizingly and beams ruddily at his classes when he reads of sack and porter and tankards foaming with the musty ale. All this is part of the liberal tradition. Men of the world are broadminded. Witness Professor Albert Thorndyke Firkins, of the University of Chicago, at the Falcon in Soho. Smiling bravely, he sits over a half-pint of bitter beer, in the company of a racing tout, a sway- backed barmaid, broad in the stern, with adjustable teeth, and three companionable tarts from Lisle street, who are making the best of two pints of Guinness. With eager impatience he awaits the arrival of G. K. Chesterton and E. V. Lucas.",1
1275,"O rare Ben Jonson! Margaret Leonard sighed with gentle laughter. Ah, Lord!""  ""My God, boy!"" Sheba roared, snatching the suggested motif of conversation out of the air, and licking her buttered fingers noisily as she stormed into action.",1
1276,"God bless him! Her hairy red face burned like clover, her veinous eyes were tearful bright. God bless him, 'Gene! He was as English as roast beef and a tankard of musty ale!""  ""Ah, Lord!"" sighed Margaret.",1
1277,"He was a genius if ever there was one. With misty eyes she gazed far off, a thread of laughter on her mouth. Whee! she laughed gently. Old Ben!""  ""And say, 'Gene!",1
1278,"Sheba continued, bending forward with a fat hand gripped upon her knee. Do you know that the greatest tribute to Shakespeare's genius is from his hand?""  ""Ah, I tell you, boy!"" said Margaret, with darkened eyes. Her voice was husky. He was afraid she was going to weep.",1
1279,"And yet the fools! Sheba yelled. The mean little two-by-two pusillanimous swill-drinking fools--""  ""Whee!",1
1280,"gently Margaret moaned. John Dorsey turned his chalk-white face to the boy and whined with vacant appreciation, winking his head pertly. Ah absently!  ""--for that's all they are, have had the effrontery to suggest that he was jealous.",1
1281,"Pshaw!"" said Margaret impatiently. There's nothing in that. Why, they don't know what they're talking about!",1
1282,"Sheba turned a sudden grinning face upon him. The little upstarts! It takes us to tell 'em, 'Gene,"" she said.",1
1283,"He began to slide floorwards out of the wicker chair. John Dorsey slapped his meaty thigh, and bent forward whining inchoately, drooling slightly at the mouth. The Lord a' mercy!"" he wheezed, gasping.",1
1284,"I was talking to a feller the other day,"" said Sheba, ""a lawyer that you'd think might know a LITTLE something, and I used a quotation out of The Merchant of Venice that every schoolboy knows-- 'The quality of mercy is not strained.' The man looked at me as if he thought I was crazy!""  ""Great heavens!"" said Margaret in a still voice. I said, 'Look here, Mr. So-and-so, you may be a smart lawyer, you may have your million dollars that they say you have, but there are a lot of things you don't know yet. There are a lot of things money can't buy, my sonny, and one of them is the society of cult- shered men and women.' Why, pshaw!"" said Mr. Leonard.",1
1285,"What do these little whipper- snappers know about the things of the mind? You might as well expect some ignorant darky out in the fields to construe a passage in Homer. He grasped a glass half full of clabber, on the table, and tilting it intently in his chalky fingers, spooned out a lumpy spilth of curds which he slid, quivering, into his mouth. No, sir! he laughed. They may be Big Men on the tax collector's books, but when they try to associate with educated men and women, as the feller says, 'they--they--'"" he began to whine, ""'why, they just ain't nothin'.' What shall it profit a man,"" said Sheba, ""if he gain the whole world, and lose--""  ""Ah, Lord!"" sighed Margaret, shaking her smoke-dark eyes.",1
1286,"I tell you! She told him. She told him of the Swan's profound knowledge of the human heart, his universal and well-rounded characterization, his enormous humor.",1
1287,Fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock! She laughed. The fat rascal! Imagine a man keeping the time!,1
1288,"And, carefully:  ""It was the custom of the time, 'Gene. As a matter of fact, when you read some of the plays of his contemporaries you see how much purer he is than they are.

1290,"There's Falstaff. Yes,"" she replied, ""and you know what happened to him, don't you?""  ""Why,"" he considered, ""he died!""  ""You see, don't you?"" she concluded, with triumphant warning. I see, don't I? The wages of sin. What, by the way, are the wages of virtue? The good die young.",1

1294,"This tin-currency of criticism she had picked up in a few courses at college, and in her reading. They were--are, perhaps, still-- part of the glib jargon of pedants. But they did her no real injury. They were simply the things people said. She felt, guiltily, that she must trick out her teaching with these gauds: she was afraid that what she had to offer was not enough. What she had to offer was simply a feeling that was so profoundly right, so unerring, that she could no more utter great verse meanly than mean verse well. She was a voice that God seeks. She was the reed of demonic ecstasy. She was possessed, she knew not how, but she knew the moment of her possession. The singing tongues of all the world were wakened into life again under the incantation of her voice. She was inhabited. She was spent.",1
1295,"She passed through their barred and bolted boy-life with the direct stride of a spirit. She opened their hearts as if they had been lockets. They said:  ""Mrs. Leonard is sure a nice lady.

1297,"But it was too long. Of Herrick, sealed of the tribe of Ben, he knew much more. The poetry sang itself. It was, he thought later, the most perfect and unfailing lyrical voice in the language--a clean, sweet, small, unfaltering note. It is done with the incomparable ease of an inspired child. The young men and women of our century have tried to recapture it, as they have tried to recapture Blake and, a little more successfully, Donne.",1

The Sunny South. Keep off the grass said Bill Nye. Jesus God! I passed the Southern Fuel Co. yesterday and saw old Wagner at the window with a fiendish smile of gloatation on his face as he looked out on the sufferings of the widows and orphans. Little does he care if they all freeze. Bob Grady dropped dead Tuesday morning as he was coming out of the Citizen's Bank. I had known him twenty- five years. He'd never been sick a day in his life. All, all are gone, the old familiar faces. Old Gant will be the next. I have been eating at Mrs. Sales' since your mother went away. You've never seen such a table as she keeps in your life--a profusion of fruits piled up in pyramids, stewed prunes, peaches, and preserves, big roasts of pork, beef, lamb, cold cuts of ham and tongue, and a half dozen vegetables in an abundance that beggars description. How in God's name she does it for thirty-five cents I don't know. Eugene is staying with the Leonards while your mother's away. I take him up to Sales' with me once or twice a week and give him a square meal. They look mighty serious when they see those long legs coming. God knows where he puts it all--he can eat more than any three people I ever saw. I suppose he gets pretty lean pickings at the school. He's got the lean and hungry Gant look. Poor child. He has no mother any more. I'll do the best I can for him until the smash comes. Leonard comes and brags about him every week. He says his equal is not to be found anywhere. Every one in town has heard of him. Preston Carr (who's sure to be the next governor) was talking to me about him the other day. He wants me to send him to the State university law school where he will make lifelong friends among the people of his own State, and then put him into politics. It's what I should have done. I'm going to give him a good education. The rest is up to him. Perhaps he'll be a credit to the name. You haven't seen him since he put on long pants. His mother picked out a beautiful suit at Moale's Christmas. He went down to Daisy's for Christmas and put them on. I bought him a cheap pair at the Racket Store for every-day wear. He can save the good ones for Sunday. Your mother has let the Old Barn to Mrs. Revell until she gets back. I went in the other day and found it warm for the first time in my life. She keeps the furnace going and she's not afraid to burn coal. I hardly ever see Ben from one week to another. He comes in and prowls around in the kitchen at one and two o'clock in the morning and I'm up and gone hours before he's awake. You can get nothing out of him--he never says a half-dozen words and if you ask him a civil question he cuts you off short. I see him down-town late at night sometimes with Mrs. P. They're thick as thieves together. I guess she's a bad egg. This is all for this time. John Duke was shot and killed by the house detective at the Whitstone hotel Sunday night. He was drunk and threatening to shoot every one. It's a sad thing for his wife. He left three children. She was in to see me to-day. He was well-liked by every one but a terror when he drank. My heart bled for her. She's a pretty little woman. Liquor has caused more misery than all the other evils in the world put together. I curse the day it was first invented. Enclosed find a small check to buy yourself a present. God knows what we're coming to.  Aff. Your Father, W. O. Gant. She saved carefully all his letters--written on his heavy slick business stationery in the huge Gothic sprawl of his crippled right hand.",1
1303,"In Florida, meanwhile, Eliza surged up and down the coast, stared thoughtfully at the ungrown town of Miami, found prices too high at Palm Beach, rents too dear at Daytona, and turned inland at length to Orlando, where, groved round with linked lakes and citrous fruits, the Pentlands waited her approach, Pett, with a cold lust of battle on her face, Will with a grimace of itching nervousness while he scaled stubbily at the flaky tetter of his hand. 24   With thick chalked fingers John Dorsey thoughtfully massaged his torso from loin to chin. Now, let me see,"" he whined with studious deliberation, ""what he gives on this. He fumbled for the notes.",1
1304,"Tom Davis turned his reddening cheeks toward the window, a low sputter of laughter escaping from his screwed lips. Guy Doak gazed solemnly at Eugene, with a forked hand stroking his grave pallid face. Entgegen,"" said Eugene, in a small choked voice, ""follows its object. John Dorsey laughed uncertainly, and shook his head, still searching the notes.",1
1305,"I'm not so sure of that,"" he said. Their wild laughter leaped like freed hounds. Tom Davis hurled himself violently downward over his desk. John Dorsey looked up, adding uncertainly his absent falsetto mirth.",1
1306,"From time to time, in spite of himself, they taught him a little German, a language of which he had been quite happily ignorant. The lesson had become for them a daily hunger: they worked it over with mad intensity, speeding and polishing their translation in order to enjoy his bewilderment. Sometimes, deliberately, they salted their pages with glib false readings, sometimes they interpolated passages of wild absurdity, waiting exultantly for his cautious amendment of a word that did not exist.",1
1307,"Slowly the moonlight crept up the chair in which the old man was sitting, reaching his knees, his breast, and finally,""--Guy Doak looked up slyly at his tutor, ""giving him a good punch in the eye. No-o,"" said John Dorsey, rubbing his chin, ""not exactly. 'Catching him squarely in the eye' gets the idiom better, I think. Tom Davis thrust a mouthful of strange gurgling noises into his desk, and waited for the classic evasion.",1
1308,"It came at once. Let me see,"" said John Dorsey, turning the pages, ""what he gives on this. Guy Doak scrawled a brief message across a crumpled wad and thrust it on Eugene's desk.",1
1309,"Eugene read:        ""Gebe mir ein Stuck Papier,       Before I bust you on the ear. He detached two slick sheets from his tablet, and wrote in answer:        ""Du bist wie eine bum-me. They read sweet gluey little stories, fat German tear-gulps: Immensee, Höher als die Kirche, Der Zerbrochene Krug.",1
1310,"Then, Wilhelm Tell. The fine lyrical measure of the opening song, the unearthly siren song to the fisher-boy, haunted them with its faery music. The heavy melodrama of some of the scenes was unhackneyed to them: they bent eagerly to the apple-shooting scene, and the escape by boat. As for the rest, it was, they wearily recognized, Great Literature. Mr. Schiller, they saw, was religiously impressed, like Patrick Henry, George Washington, and Paul Revere, with the beauties of Liberty. His embattled Swiss bounded ponderously from crag to crag, invoking it in windy speeches.",1
1311,"The mountains,"" observed John Dorsey, touched, in a happy moment, by the genius of the place, ""have been the traditional seat of Liberty. Eugene turned his face toward the western ranges. He heard, far off, a whistle, a remote, thunder on the rails.",1
1312,"During this season of Eliza's absence he roomed with Guy Doak. Guy Doak was five years his senior. He was a native of Newark, New Jersey: his speech was touched with Yankee nasality, his manner with Yankee crispness. His mother, a boarding-house mistress, had come to Altamont a year or two before to retrieve her health: she was tubercular, and spent part of the winter in Florida.",1
1313,"Guy Doak had a trim cocky figure of medium height, black hair, bright dark eyes, a pale, very smooth oval face, somehow suggestive, Eugene thought, of a fish's belly, with somewhat unhappily full jaws which made his lower features seem larger than his upper. He was foppishly neat in his dress. People called him a good-looking boy.",1
1314,"He made few friends. To the boys at Leonard's this Yankee was far more remote than the rich Cuban boy, Manuel Quevado, whose fat dark laughter and broken speech was all for girls. He belonged to a richer South, but they knew him.",1
1315,"Guy Doak had none of their floridity. He was lacking in their hearty violence. He did not laugh loudly. He had a sharp, bright, shallow mind, inflexibly dogmatic. His companions were bad Southern romantics, he was a false Yankee realist. They arrived, thus, by different means, at a common goal of superstition. Guy Doak had already hardened into the American city-dweller's mould of infantile cynicism. He was occasionally merry with the other boys in the classic manner of the city fellow with the yokels. He was wise. Above all, he was wise. It was safe to assume, he felt, that Truth was always on the scaffold, and Wrong forever on the throne. So far from being depressed by the slaughter of the innocents, the spectacle gave him much bitter amusement.",1
1316,"Outside of this, Guy Doak was a very nice fellow--sharp, obstinate, unsubtle, and pleased with his wit. They lived on the first floor at Leonard's: at night, by a roaring wood fire, they listened carefully to the great thunder of the trees, and to the stealthy creaking foot-steps of the master as he came softly down the stairs, and paused by their door. They ate at table with Margaret, John Dorsey, Miss Amy, the two children, John Dorsey, junior, nine, and Margaret, five, and two of Leonard's Tennessee nephews--Tyson Leonard, a ferret-faced boy of eighteen, foulmouthed and sly, and Dirk Barnard, a tall slender boy, seventeen, with a bumpy face, brown merry eyes, and a quick temper. At table they kept up a secret correspondence of innuendo and hidden movement, fleshing a fork in a grunting neighbor as John Dorsey said the blessing, and choking with smothered laughter. At night, they tapped messages on floor and ceiling, crept out for sniggering conventions in the windy dark hall, and fled to their innocent beds as John Dorsey stormed down on them.",1
1317,"Leonard was fighting hard to keep his little school alive. He had less than twenty students the first year, and less than thirty the second. From an income of not more than $3,000 he had to pay Miss Amy, who had left a high school position to help him, a small salary. The old house on its fine wooded hill was full of outmoded plumbing and drafty corridors: he had leased it at a small rental. But the rough usage of thirty boys demanded a considerable yearly restoration. The Leonards were fighting very stubbornly and courageously for their existence.",1
1318,"The food was scant and poor: at breakfast, a dish of blue, watery oatmeal, eggs and toast; at lunch, a thin soup, hot sour cornbread, and a vegetable boiled with a piece of fat pork; at dinner, hot biscuits, a small meat loaf, and creamed or boiled potatoes. No one was permitted coffee or tea, but there was an abundance of fresh creamy milk. John Dorsey always kept and milked his own cow. Occasionally there was a deep, crusted pie, hot, yolky muffins, or spicy gingerbread of Margaret's make. She was a splendid cook.",1
1319,"Often, at night, Guy Doak slid quietly out through the window on to the side porch, and escaped down the road under the concealing roar of the trees. He would return from town within two hours, crawling in exultantly with a bag full of hot frankfurter sandwiches coated thickly with mustard, chopped onion, and a hot Mexican sauce. With a crafty grin he unfoiled two five-cent cigars, which they smoked magnificently, with a sharp tang of daring, blowing the smoke up the chimney in order to thwart a possible irruption by the master. And Guy brought back, from the wind and the night, the good salt breath of gossip in street and store, news of the town, and the brave swagger of the drugstore gallants.",1
1320,"As they smoked and stuffed fat palatable bites of sandwich into their mouths, they would regard each other with pleased sniggers, carrying on thus an insane symphony of laughter:  ""Chuckle, chuckle!--laugh of gloatation. Tee-hee, tee-hee, tee-hee! . . laugh of titterosity. Snuh-huh, snuh-huh, snuh-huh! . .",1
1321,"laugh of gluttonotiousness. The vigorous warmth of burning wood filled their room pleasantly: over their sheltered heads the dark gigantic wind howled through the earth. O sheltered love, nooked warmly in against this winter night. O warm fair women, whether within a forest hut, or by the town ledged high above the moaning seas, shot upon the wind, I come.",1
1322,"Guy Doak toyed gently at his belly with his right hand, and stroked his round chin slowly with his left. Now let me see,"" he whined, ""what he gives on this. Their laughter rang around the walls.",1
1323,"Too late, they heard the aroused stealthy foot-falls of the master, creaking down the hall. Later--silence, the dark, the wind. Miss Amy closed her small beautifully kept grade book, thrust her great arms upward, and yawned. Eugene looked hopefully at her and out along the playing court, reddened by the late sun. He was wild, uncontrollable, erratic. His mad tongue leaped out in class. He could never keep peace a full day. He amazed them. They loved him, and they punished him piously, affectionately. He was never released at the dismissal hour. He was always ""kept in. John Dorsey noted each whisper of disorder, or each failure in preparation, by careful markings in a book.",1
1324,"Each afternoon he read the names of delinquents, amid a low mutter of sullen protest, and stated their penalties. Once Eugene got through an entire day without a mark. He stood triumphantly before Leonard while the master searched the record.",1
1325,"John Dorsey began to laugh foolishly; he gripped his hand affectionately around the boy's arm. Well, sir!"" he said. There must be a mistake. I'm going to keep you in on general principles. He bent to a long dribbling suction of laughter.",1
1326,"Eugene's wild eyes were shot with tears of anger and surprise. He never forgot. Miss Amy yawned, and smiled on him with slow powerful affectionate contempt.",1
1327,"Go on! she said, in her broad, lazy accent. I don't want to fool with you any more. You're not worth powder enough to blow you up. Margaret came in, her face furrowed deeply between smoke-dark eyes, full of tender sternness and hidden laughter.",1
1328,"What's wrong with the rascal?"" she asked. Can't he learn algebra? He can learn!",1
1329,drawled Miss Amy. He can learn anything. He's lazy--that's what it is. Just plain lazy. She smacked his buttock smartly with a ruler.,1
1330,"I'd like to warm you a bit with this,"" she laughed, slowly and richly. You'd learn then. Here!"" said Margaret, shaking her head in protest.",1
1331,"You leave that boy alone. Don't look behind the faun's ears. Never mind about algebra, here. That's for poor folks. There's no need for algebra where two and two make five. Miss Amy turned her handsome gypsy eyes on Eugene.",1
1332,Go on. I've seen enough of you. She made a strong weary gesture of dismissal.,1
1333,"Hatless, with a mad whoop, he plunged through the door and leaped the porch rail. Here, boy! Margaret called. Where's your hat?""  Grinning, he galloped back, picked up a limp rag of dirty green felt, and pulled it over his chaotic hair.",1
1334,"Curly tufts stuck through the gaping crease-holes. Come here!"" said Margaret gravely. Her nervous fingers pulled his frayed necktie around to the front, tugged down his vest, and buttoned his coat over tightly, while he peered at her with his strange devil's grin. Suddenly she trembled with laughter.",1
1335,"Good heavens, Amy,"" she said. Look at that hat. Miss Amy smiled at him with indifferent sleepy cat-warmth.",1
1336,"You want to fix yourself up, 'Gene,"" she said, ""so the girls will begin to notice you. He heard the strange song of Margaret's laughter. Can you see him out courting?"" she said. The poor girl would think she had a demon lover, sure. As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted       By woman wailing for her demon lover.",1
1337,"His eyes burned on her face, flowing with dark secret beauty. Get along, you scamp! she ordered.",1
1338,"He turned, and, crying fiercely in his throat, tore down the road with bounding strides. All the dusk blurred in her eyes. Leave him alone! she whispered to no one. Leave him alone! A light wind of April fanned over the hill.",1
1339,"There was a smell of burning leaves and rubble around the school. In the field on the hill flank behind the house a plowman drove his big horse with loose clanking traces around a lessening square of dry fallow earth. Gee, woa. His strong feet followed after. The big share bit cleanly down, cleaving a deep spermy furrow of moist young earth along its track.",1
1340,John Dorsey Leonard stared fascinated out the window at the annual rejuvenation of the earth. Before his eyes the emergent nymph was scaling her hard cracked hag's pelt. The golden age returned.,1
1341,"Down the road a straggling queue of boys were all gone into the world of light. Wet with honest sweat, the plowman paused at the turn, and wiped the blue shirting of his forearm across his beaded forehead. Meanwhile, his intelligent animal, taking advantage of the interval, lifted with slow majesty a proud flowing tail, and added his mite to the fertility of the soil with three moist oaty droppings. Watching, John Dorsey grunted approvingly. They also serve who only stand and wait.",1
1342,"Please, Mr. Leonard,"" said Eugene, carefully choosing his moment, ""can I go?""  John Dorsey Leonard stroked his chin absently, and stared sightlessly at his book. Others abide our question, thou art free. Huh?"" he purred vaguely. Then, with a high vacant snigger he turned suddenly, and said:  ""You rascal, you!",1
1343,"See if Mrs. Leonard wants you. He fastened his brutal grip with keen hunger into the boy's thin arm. April is the cruellest of months. Eugene winced, moved away, and then stood quietly, checked by memory of the old revolt from awe.",1
1344,"He found Margaret in the library reading to the children from The Water Babies. Mr. Leonard says to ask you if I can go?"" he said. And her eyes were darkened wholly.",1
1345,"Yes, you scamp. Go on,"" she said. Tell me, boy,"" she coaxed, softly, ""can't you be a little bit better?""  ""Yes'm,"" he promised, easily.",1
1346,I'll try. Say not the struggle naught availeth. She smiled at his high mettled prancing nervousness.,1
1347,"In hell they'll roast thee like a herrin',"" she said gently. Get out of here. He bounded away from the nunnery of the chaste breast and quiet mind.",1
1348,"As he leaped down the stairs into the yard he heard Dirk Barnard's lusty splashing bathtub solo. Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song. Tyson Leonard, having raked into every slut's corner of nature with a thin satisfied grin, emerged from the barn with a cap full of fresh eggs. A stammering cackle of protest followed him from angry hens who found too late that men betray. At the barnside, under the carriage shed, ""Pap"" Rheinhart tightened the bellyband of his saddled brown mare, swinging strongly into the saddle, and with a hard scramble of hoofs, came up the hill, wheeled in behind the house, and drew up by Eugene.",1
1349,"Jump on, 'Gene,"" he invited, patting the mare's broad rump. I'll take you home. Eugene looked up at him grinning.",1
1350,"You'll take me nowhere,"" he said. I couldn't sit down for a week last time. Pap"" boomed with laughter.",1
1351,"Why, pshaw, boy! he said. That was nothing but a gentle little dog-trot. Dog-trot your granny,"" said Eugene.",1
1352,"You tried to kill me. Pap"" Rheinhart turned his wry neck down on the boy with grave dry humor. Come on,"" he said gruffly. I'm not going to hurt you. I'll teach you how to ride a horse. Much obliged, Pap,"" said Eugene ironically.",1
1353,"But I'm thinking of using my tail a good deal in my old age. I don't want to wear it out while I'm young. Pleased with them both, ""Pap"" Rheinhart laughed loud and deep, spat a brown quid back over the horse's crupper, and, digging his heels in smartly, galloped away around the house, into the road.",1
1354,"The horse bent furiously to his work, like a bounding dog. With four- hooved thunder he drummed upon the sounding earth. Quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum.",1
1355,"At the two-posted entry, by the bishop's boundary, the departing students turned, split quickly to the sides, and urged the horseman on with shrill cries. Pap"" bent low, with loose-reined hands above the horse-mane, went through the gate like the whiz of a cross-bow. Then, he jerked the mare back on her haunches with a dusty skid of hoofs, and waited for the boys to come up.",1
1356,"Hey!""  With high bounding exultancy Eugene came down the road to join them. Without turning, stolid Van Yeats threw up his hand impatiently and greeted the unseen with a cheer. The others turned, welcoming him with ironical congratulation.",1
1357,"'Highpockets,'"" said ""Doc"" Hines, comically puckering his small tough face, ""how'd you happen to git out on time? He had an affected, high-pitched nigger drawl. When he spoke he kept one hand in his coat pocket, fingering a leather thong loaded with buckshot.",1
1358,"J. D. had to do his spring plowing,"" said Eugene. Well, if it ain't ole Handsome,"" said Julius Arthur. He grinned squintily, revealing a mouthful of stained teeth screwed in a wire clamp. His face was covered with small yellow pustulate sores. How begot, how nourished?  ""Shall we sing our little song for Handsome Hal?"" said Ralph Rolls to his copesmate Julius.",1
1359,"He wore a derby hat jammed over his pert freckled face. As he spoke he took a ragged twist of tobacco from his pocket and bit off a large chew with a rough air of relish. Want a chew, Jule?"" he said.",1
1360,"Julius took the twist, wiped off his mouth with a loose male grin, and crammed a large quid into his cheek. He brought me roots of relish sweet. Want one, Highpockets? he asked Eugene, grinning.",1
1361,"I hate him that would upon the rack of this tough world stretch me out longer. Hell,"" said Ralph Rolls. Handsome would curl up and die if he ever took a chew.",1
1362,"In Spring like torpid snakes my enemies awaken. At the corner of Church Street, across from the new imitation Tudor of the Episcopal church, they paused. Above them, on the hill, rose the steeples of the Methodist and Presbyterian churches. Ye antique spires, ye distant towers!",1
1363,"Who's going my way?"" said Julius Arthur. Come on, 'Gene. The car's down here. I'll take you home. Thanks, but I can't,"" said Eugene.",1
1364,"I'm going up-town. Their curious eyes on Dixieland when I get out. You going home, Villa?""  ""No,"" said George Graves.",1
1365,"Well, keep Hal out of trouble,"" said Ralph Rolls. Julius Arthur laughed roughly and thrust his hand through Eugene's hair. Old Hairbreadth Hal,"" he said. The cutthroat from Saw- Tooth Gap!""  ""Don't let 'em climb your frame, son,"" said Van Yeats, turning his quiet pleasant face on Eugene.",1
1366,"If you need help, let me know. So long, boys.""  ""So long. They crossed the street, mixing in nimble horse-play, and turned down past the church along a sloping street that led to the garages.",1
1367,"George Graves and Eugene continued up the hill. Julius is a good boy,"" said George Graves. His father makes more money than any other lawyer in town. Yes,"" said Eugene, still brooding on Dixieland and his clumsy deceptions.",1
1368,"A street-sweeper walked along slowly uphill, beside his deep wedge- bodied cart. From time to time he stopped the big slow-footed horse and, sweeping the littered droppings of street and gutter into a pan, with a long-handled brush, dumped his collections into the cart. Let not Ambition mock their useful toil.",1
1369,"Three sparrows hopped deftly about three fresh smoking globes of horse-dung, pecking out tidbits with dainty gourmandism. Driven away by the approaching cart, they skimmed briskly over to the bank, with bright twitters of annoyance. One too like thee, tameless, and swift, and proud.",1
1370,"George Graves ascended the hill with a slow ponderous rhythm, staring darkly at the ground. Say, 'Gene! he said finally. I don't believe he makes that much. Eugene thought seriously for a moment.",1
1371,"With George Graves, it was necessary to resume a discussion where it had been left off three days before. Who?"" he said, ""John Dorsey? Yes, I think he does,"" he added, grinning.",1
1372,"Not over $2,500, anyway,"" said George Graves gloomily. No--three thousand, three thousand!"" he said, in a choking voice. George Graves turned to him with a sombre, puzzled smile. What's the matter?"" he asked.",1
1373,"O you fool! You damn fool! gasped Eugene. You've been thinking about it all this time. George Graves laughed sheepishly, with embarrassment, richly.",1
1374,"From the top of the hill at the left, the swelling unction of the Methodist organ welled up remotely from the choir, accompanied by a fruity contralto voice, much in demand at funerals. Abide with me. Most musical of mourners, weep again!",1
1375,"George Graves turned and examined the four large black houses, ascending on flat terraces to the church, of Paston Place. That's a good piece of property, 'Gene,"" he said. It belongs to the Paston estate. Fast falls the even-tide.",1
1376,"Heaves the proud harlot her distended breast, in intricacies of laborious song. It will all go to Gil Paston some day,"" said George Graves with virtuous regret. He's not worth a damn. They had reached the top of the hill.",1
1377,"Church Street ended levelly a block beyond, in the narrow gulch of the avenue. They saw, with quickened pulse, the little pullulation of the town. A negro dug tenderly in the round loamy flowerbeds of the Presbyterian churchyard, bending now and then to thrust his thick fingers gently in about the roots. The old church, with its sharp steeple, rotted slowly, decently, prosperously, like a good man's life, down into its wet lichened brick. Eugene looked gratefully, with a second's pride, at its dark decorum, its solid Scotch breeding.",1
1378,"I'm a Presbyterian,"" he said. What are you?""  ""An Episcopalian, when I go,"" said George Graves with irreverent laughter. To hell with these Methodists! Eugene said with an elegant, disdainful face. They're too damn common for us. God in three persons--blessed Trinity. Brother Graves,"" he continued, in a fat well-oiled voice, ""I didn't see you at prayer-meeting Wednesday night. Where in Jesus' name were you?""  With his open palm he struck George Graves violently between his meaty shoulders.",1
1379,"George Graves staggered drunkenly with high resounding laughter. Why, Brother Gant,"" said he, ""I had a little appointment with one of the Good Sisters, out in the cow-shed. Eugene gathered a telephone pole into his wild embrace, and threw one leg erotically over its second foot-wedge.",1
1380,"George Graves leaned his heavy shoulder against it, his great limbs drained with laughter. There was a hot blast of steamy air from the Appalachian Laundry across the street and, as the door from the office of the washroom opened, they had a moment's glimpse of negresses plunging their wet arms into the liquefaction of their clothes. George Graves dried his eyes. Laughing wearily, they crossed over.",1
1381,"We oughtn't to talk like that, 'Gene,"" said George Graves reproachfully. Sure enough! It's not right. He became moodily serious rapidly.",1
1382,"The best people in this town are church members,"" he said earnestly. It's a fine thing. Why?"" said Eugene, with an idle curiosity.",1
1383,"Because,"" said George Graves, ""you get to know all the people who are worth a damn. Worth being damned, he thought quickly. A quaint idea.",1
1384,"It helps you in a business way. They come to know you and respect you. You won't get far in this town, 'Gene, without them. It pays,"" he added devoutly, ""to be a Christian. Yes,"" Eugene agreed seriously, ""you're right.",1
1385,"To walk together to the kirk, with a goodly company. He thought sadly of his lost sobriety, and of how once, lonely, he had walked the decent lanes of God's Scotch town. Unbidden they came again to haunt his memory, the shaven faces of good tradesmen, each leading the well washed kingdom of his home in its obedient ritual the lean hushed smiles of worship, the chained passion of devotion, as they implored God's love upon their ventures, or delivered their virgin daughters into the holy barter of marriage. And from even deeper adyts of his brain there swam up slowly to the shores of his old hunger the great fish whose names he scarcely knew--whose names, garnered with blind toil from a thousand books, from Augustine, himself a name, to Jeremy Taylor, the English metaphysician, were brief evocations of scalded light, electric, phosphorescent, illuminating by their magic connotations the vast far depths of ritual and religion:  They came--Bartholomew, Hilarius, Chrysostomos, Polycarp, Anthony, Jerome, and the forty martyrs of Cappadocia who walked the waves--coiled like their own green shadows for a moment, and were gone.",1
1386,"Besides,"" said George Graves, ""a man ought to go anyway. Honesty's the best policy. Across the street, on the second floor of a small brick three-story building that housed several members of the legal, medical, surgical, and dental professions, Dr. H. M. Smathers pumped vigorously with his right foot, took a wad of cotton from his assistant, Miss Lola Bruce, and thrusting it securely into the jaw of the unseen patient, bent his fashionable bald head intently.",1
1387,"A tiny breeze blew back the thin curtains, and revealed him, white- jacketed, competent, drill in hand. Do you feel that? he said tenderly.",1
1388,"Wrogd gdo gurk!""  ""Spit! With thee conversing, I forget all time. I suppose,"" said George Graves thoughtfully, ""the gold they use in people's teeth is worth a lot of money. Yes,"" said Eugene, finding the idea attractive, ""if only one person in ten has gold fillings that would be ten million in the United States alone.",1
1389,"You can figure on five dollars' worth each, can't you?""  ""Easy!"" said George Graves. More than that. He brooded lusciously a moment. That's a lot of money,"" he said.",1
1390,"In the office of the Rogers-Malone Undertaking Establishment the painful family of death was assembled, ""Horse"" Hines, tilted back in a swivel chair, with his feet thrust out on the broad window- ledge, chatted lazily with Mr. C. M. Powell, the suave silent partner. How sleep the brave, who sink to rest. Forget not yet.",1
1391,"There's good money in undertaking,"" said George Graves. Mr. Powell's well off. Eugene's eyes were glued on the lantern face of ""Horse"" Hines.",1
1392,"He beat the air with a convulsive arm, and sank his fingers in his throat. What's the matter?"" cried George Graves. They shall not bury me alive,"" he said.",1
1393,"You can't tell,"" George Graves said gloomily. It's been known to happen. They've dug them up later and found them turned over on their faces. Eugene shuddered.",1
1394,"I think,"" he suggested painfully, ""they're supposed to take out your insides when they embalm you. Yes,"" said George Graves more hopefully, ""and that stuff they use would kill you anyway. They pump you full of it. With shrunken heart, Eugene considered.",1
1395,"The ghost of old fear, that had been laid for years, walked forth to haunt him. In his old fantasies of death he had watched his living burial, had foreseen his waking life-in-death, his slow, frustrated efforts to push away the smothering flood of earth until, as a drowning swimmer claws the air, his mute and stiffened fingers thrust from the ground a call for hands. Fascinated, they stared through screen-doors down the dark central corridor, flanked by jars of weeping ferns. A sweet funereal odor of carnations and cedar-wood floated on the cool heavy air. Dimly, beyond a central partition, they saw a heavy casket, on a wheeled trestle, with rich silver handles and velvet coverings. The thick light faded there in dark.",1
1396,"They're laid out in the room behind,"" said George Graves, lowering his voice. To rot away into a flower, to melt into a tree with the friendless bodies of unburied men. At this moment, having given to misery all he had (a tear), the very Reverend Father James O'Haley, S.J., among the faithless faithful only he, unshaken, unseduced, unterrified, emerged plumply from the chapel, walked up the soft aisle rug with brisk short- legged strides, and came out into the light. His pale blue eyes blinked rapidly for a moment, his plump uncreased face set firmly in a smile of quiet benevolence; he covered himself with a small well-kept hat of black velvet, and set off toward the avenue. Eugene shrank back gently as the little man walked past him: that small priestly figure in black bore on him the awful accolade of his great Mistress, that smooth face had heard the unutterable, seen the unknowable. In this remote outpost of the mighty Church, he was the standard-bearer of the one true faith, the consecrate flesh of God.",1
1397,"They don't get any pay,"" said George Graves sorrowfully. How do they live, then? Eugene asked.",1
1398,"Don't you worry!"" said George Graves, with a knowing smile. They get all that's coming to them. He doesn't seem to be starving, does he?""  ""No,"" said Eugene, ""he doesn't.",1
1399,"He lives on the fat of the land,"" said George Graves. Wine at every meal. There are some rich Catholics in this town. Yes,"" said Eugene.",1
1400,"Frank Moriarty's got a pot full of money that he made selling licker. Don't let them hear you,"" said George Graves, with a surly laugh. They've got a family tree and a coat of arms already. A beer-bottle rampant on a field of limburger cheese, gules,"" said Eugene.",1
1401,"They're trying to get the Princess Madeleine into Society,"" said George Graves. Hell fire! Eugene cried, grinning. Let's let her in, if that's all she wants. We belong to the Younger Set, don't we?""  ""You may,"" said George Graves, reeling with laughter, ""but I don't.",1
1402,"I wouldn't be caught dead with the little pimps. Mr. Eugene Gant was the host last night at a hot wienie roast given to members of the local Younger Set at Dixieland, the beautiful old ancestral mansion of his mother, Mrs. Eliza Gant. George Graves staggered.",1
1403,"You oughtn't to say that, 'Gene,"" he gasped. He shook his head reproachfully. Your mother's a fine woman. During the course of the evening, the Honorable George Graves, the talented scion of one of our oldest and wealthiest families, the Chesterfield Graveses, ($10 a week and up), rendered a few appropriate selections on the jews-harp.",1
1404,"Pausing deliberately, George Graves wiped his streaming eyes, and blew his nose. In the windows of Bain's millinery store, a waxen nymph bore a confection of rakish plumes upon her false tresses, and extended her simpering fingers in elegant counterpoise. Hats For Milady. O that those lips had language.",1
1405,"At this moment, with a smooth friction of trotting rumps, the death-wagon of Rogers-Malone turned swiftly in from the avenue, and wheeled by on ringing hoofs. They turned curiously and watched it draw up to the curb. Another Redskin bit the dust,"" said George Graves.",1
1406,"Come, delicate death, serenely arriving, arriving. Horse"" Hines came out quickly on long flapping legs, and opened the doors behind. In another moment, with the help of the two men on the driver's seat, he had lowered the long wicker basket gently, and vanished, quietly, gravely, into the fragrant gloom of his establishment.",1
1407,"As Eugene watched, the old fatality of place returned. Each day, he thought, we pass the spot where some day we must die; or shall I, too, ride dead to some mean building yet unknown? Shall this bright clay, the hill-bound, die in lodgings yet unbuilt? Shall these eyes, drenched with visions yet unseen, stored with the viscous and interminable seas at dawn, with the sad comfort of unfulfilled Arcadias, seal up their cold dead dreams upon a tick, as this, in time, in some hot village of the plains?",1
1408,"He caught and fixed the instant. A telegraph messenger wheeled vigorously in from the avenue with pumping feet, curved widely into the alley at his right, jerking his wheel up sharply as he took the curb and coasted down to the delivery boy's entrance. And post o'er land and ocean without rest. Milton, thou shouldst be living at this hour.",1
1409,"Descending the dark stairs of the Medical Building slowly, Mrs. Thomas Hewitt, the comely wife of the prominent attorney (of Arthur, Hewitt, and Grey), turned out into the light, and advanced slowly toward the avenue. She was greeted with flourishing gestures of the hat by Henry T. Merriman (Merriman and Merriman), and Judge Robert C. Allan, professional colleagues of her husband. She smiled and shot each quickly with a glance. Pleasant is this flesh. When she had passed they looked after her a moment. Then they continued their discussion of the courts.",1
1410,"On the third floor of the First National Bank building on the right hand corner, Fergus Paston, fifty-six, a thin lecherous mouth between iron-gray dundrearies, leaned his cocked leg upon his open window, and followed the movements of Miss Bernie Powers, twenty- two, crossing the street. Even in our ashes live their wonted fires. On the opposite corner, Mrs. Roland Rawls, whose husband was manager of the Peerless Pulp Company (Plant No. 3), and whose father owned it, emerged from the rich seclusion of Arthur N. Wright, jeweller. She clasped her silver mesh-bag and stepped into her attendant Packard. She was a tall black-haired woman of thirty-three with a good figure: her face was dull, flat, and Mid- western.",1
1411,"She's the one with the money,"" said George Graves. He hasn't a damn thing. It's all in her name. She wants to be an opera singer. Can she sing?""  ""Not worth a damn,"" said George Graves.",1
1412,"I've heard her. There's your chance, 'Gene. She's got a daughter about your age. What does she do?"" said Eugene.",1
1413,"She wants to be an actress,"" said George Graves, laughing throatily. You have to work too damn hard for your money,"" said Eugene. They had reached the corner by the Bank, and now halted, indecisively, looking up the cool gulch of afternoon. The street buzzed with a light gay swarm of idlers: the faces of the virgins bloomed in and out like petals on a bough. Advancing upon him, an inch to the second, Eugene saw, ten feet away, the heavy paralyzed body of old Mr. Avery. He was a very great scholar, stone-deaf, and seventy-eight years old. He lived alone in a room above the Public Library. He had neither friends nor connections. He was a myth.",1
1414,"Oh, my God!"" said Eugene. Here he comes! It was too late for escape.",1
1415,"Gasping a welcome, Mr. Avery bore down on him, with a violent shuffle of his feet and a palsied tattoo of his heavy stick which brought him over the intervening three yards in forty seconds. Well, young fellow,"" he panted, ""how's Latin?""  ""Fine,"" Eugene screamed into his pink ear. Poeta nascitur, non fit,"" said Mr. Avery, and went off into a silent wheeze of laughter which brought on a fit of coughing strangulation. His eyes bulged, his tender pink skin grew crimson, he roared his terror out in a phlegmy rattle, while his goose-white hand trembled frantically for his handkerchief. A crowd gathered. Eugene quickly drew a dirty handkerchief from the old man's pocket, and thrust it into his hands. He tore up from his convulsed organs a rotting mass, and panted rapidly for breath. The crowd dispersed somewhat dejectedly.",1
1416,"George Graves grinned darkly. That's too bad,"" he said. You oughtn't to laugh, 'Gene. He turned away, gurgling.",1
1417,"Can you conjugate?"" gasped Mr. Avery. Here's the way I learned:        ""Amo, amas,       I love a lass.       Amat,       He loves her, too. Quivering with tremors of laughter, he launched himself again.",1
1418,"Because he could not leave them, save by the inch, they moved off several yards to the curb. Grow old along with me! That's a damn shame,"" said George Graves, looking after him and shaking his head. Where's he going?""  ""To supper,"" said Eugene.",1
1419,"To supper!"" said George Graves. It's only four o'clock. Where does he eat?""  Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.",1
1420,"At the Uneeda,"" said Eugene, beginning to choke, ""It takes him two hours to get there. Does he go every day?"" said George Graves, beginning to laugh. Three times a day,"" Eugene screamed. He spends all morning going to dinner, and all afternoon going to supper. A whisper of laughter came from their weary jaws.",1
1421,"They sighed like sedge. At this moment, dodging briskly through the crowd, with a loud and cheerful word for every one, Mr. Joseph Bailey, secretary of the Altamont Chamber of Commerce, short, broad, and ruddy, came up by them with a hearty gesture of the hand:  ""Hello, boys! he cried. How're they going? But before either of them could answer, he had passed on, with an encouraging shake of his head, and a deep applauding ""THAT'S right. WHAT'S right?"" said Eugene.",1
1422,"But before George Graves could answer, the great lung specialist, Dr. Fairfax Grinder, scion of one of the oldest and proudest families in Virginia, drove in viciously from Church Street, with his sinewy length of six feet and eight inches coiled tensely in the deep pit of his big Buick roadster. Cursing generally the whole crawling itch of Confederate and Yankee postwar rabbledom, with a few special parentheses for Jews and niggers, he drove full tilt at the short plump figure of Joe Zamschnick, men's furnishings (""Just a Whisper Off The Square""). Joseph, two yards away from legal safety, hurled himself with a wild scream headlong at the curb. He arrived on hands and knees, but under his own power.",1
1423,"K-hurses!"" said Eugene. Foiled again. 'Twas true!",1
1424,"Dr. Fairfax Grinder's lean bristled upper lip drew back over his strong yellow teeth. He jammed on his brakes, and lifted his car round with a complete revolution of his long arms. Then he roared away through scattering traffic, in a greasy blue cloud of gasoline and burnt rubber.",1
1425,"Joe Zamschnick frantically wiped his gleaming bald head with a silk handkerchief and called loudly on the public to bear witness. What's the matter with him?"" said George Graves, disappointed. He usually goes up on the sidewalk after them if he can't get them on the street. On the other side of the street, attracting no more than a languid stare from the loafing natives, the Honorable William Jennings Bryan paused benevolently before the windows of the H. Martin Grimes Bookstore, allowing the frisking breeze to toy pleasantly with his famous locks.",1
1426,"The tangles of Neaera's hair. The Commoner stared carefully at the window display which included several copies of Before Adam, by Jack London. Then he entered, and selected a dozen views of Altamont and the surrounding hills.",1
1427,"He may come here to live,"" said George Graves. Dr. Doak's offered to give him a house and lot in Doak Park. Why?"" said Eugene.",1
1428,"Because the advertising will be worth a lot to the town,"" said George Graves. A little before them, that undaunted daughter of desires, Miss Elizabeth Scragg, emerged from Woolworth's Five and Ten Cent Store, and turned up toward the Square. Smiling, she acknowledged the ponderous salute of Big Jeff White, the giant half-owner of the Whitstone hotel, whose fortunes had begun when he had refused to return to his old comrade, Dickson Reese, the embezzling cashier, ninety thousand dollars of entrusted loot. Dog eat dog. Thief catch thief. It is not growing like a tree, in bulk doth make man better be.",1
1429,"His six-and-a-half-foot shadow flitted slowly before them. He passed, in creaking number twelves, a massive smooth-jowled man with a great paunch girdled in a wide belt. Across the street again, before the windows of the Van W. Yeats Shoe Company, the Reverend J. Brooks Gall, Amherst ('61), and as loyal a Deke as ever breathed, but looking only sixty of his seventy-three years, paused in his brisk walk, and engaged in sprightly monologue, three of his fellow Boy Scouts--the Messrs. Lewis Monk, seventeen, Bruce Rogers, thirteen, and Malcolm Hodges, fourteen. None knew as well as he the heart of a boy. He, too, it seems, had once been one himself. Thus, as one bright anecdote succeeded, or suggested, a half-dozen others, they smiled dutifully, with attentive respect, below the lifted barrier of his bristly white mustache, into the gleaming rhyme of his false teeth. And, with rough but affectionate camaraderie, he would pause from time to time to say:  ""Old Male! or ""Old Bruce! gripping firmly his listener's arm, shaking him gently. Pallidly, on restless feet, they smiled, plotting escape with slant-eyed stealth.",1
1430,"Mr. Buse, the Oriental rug merchant, came around the corner below them from Liberty Street. His broad dark face was wreathed in Persian smiles. I met a traveller from an antique land.",1
1431,"In the Bijou Cafe for Ladies and Gents, Mike, the counter man, leaned his hairy arms upon the marble slab, and bent his wrinkled inch of brow upon a week-old copy of Atlantis. Fride Chicken To- day with Sweet Potatos. Hail to thee, blithe spirit, bird thou never wert. A solitary fly darted swiftly about the greasy cover of a glass humidor, under which a leathery quarter of mince pie lay weltering. Spring had come.",1
1432,"Meanwhile, having completed twice their parade up and down the street from the Square to the post-office, the Misses Christine Ball, Viola Powell, Aline Rollins, and Dorothy Hazzard were accosted outside Wood's Drug Store by Tom French, seventeen, Roy Duncan, nineteen, and Carl Jones, eighteen. Where do you think you're going?"" said Tom French, insolently. Gayly, brightly, in unison, they answered:  ""Hey--ee!""  ""Hay's seven dollars a ton,"" said Roy Duncan, and immediately burst into a high cackle of laughter, in which all the others joined, merrily.",1
1433,"You craz-ee!"" said Viola Powell tenderly. Tell me, ye merchants' daughters, did ye see another creature fair and wise as she. Mr. Duncan,"" said Tom French, turning his proud ominous face upon his best friend, ""I want you to meet a friend of mine, Miss Rollins. I think I've met this man somewhere before,"" said Aline Rollins.",1
1434,"Another Splendor on his mouth alit. Yes,"" said Roy Duncan, ""I go there often. His small tight freckled impish face creased again by his high cackle.",1
1435,"All I could never be. They moved into the store, where drouthy neibors neibors meet, through the idling group of fountain gallants. Mr. Henry Sorrell (It Can Be Done), and Mr. John T. Howland (We Sell Lots and Lots of Lots), emerged, beyond Arthur N. Wright's, jeweller, from the gloomy dusk of the Gruner Building. Each looked into the sub-divisions of the other's heart; their eyes kept the great Vision of the guarded mount as swiftly they turned into Church Street where Sorrell's Hudson was parked.",1
1436,"White-vested, a trifle paunchy, with large broad feet, a shaven moon of red face, and abundant taffy-colored hair, the Reverend John Smallwood, pastor of the First Baptist Church, walked heavily up the street, greeting his parishioners warmly, and hoping to see his Pilot face to face. Instead, however, he encountered the Honorable William Jennings Bryan, who was coming slowly out of the bookstore. The two close friends greeted each other affectionately, and, with a firm friendly laying on of hands, gave each to each the Christian aid of a benevolent exorcism.",1
1437,"Just the man I was looking for,"" said Brother Smallwood. In silence, slowly, they shook hands for several seconds. Silence was pleased.",1
1438,"That,"" observed the Commoner with grave humor, ""is what I thought the Great American People said to me on three occasions. It was a favorite jest--ripe with wisdom, mellowed by the years, yet, withal, so characteristic of the man. The deep furrows of his mouth widened in a smile. Our master--famous, calm, and dead.",1
1439,"Passed, on catspaw rubber tread, from the long dark bookstore, Professor L. B. Dunn, principal of Graded School No. 3, Montgomery Avenue. He smiled coldly at them with a gimlet narrowing of his spectacled eyes. The tell-tale cover of The New Republic peeked from his pocket. Clamped under his lean and freckled arm were new library copies of The Great Illusion, by Norman Angell, and The Ancient Grudge, by Owen Wister. A lifelong advocate of a union of the two great English-speaking (sic) nations, making together irresistibly for peace, truth, and righteousness in a benevolent but firm authority over the less responsible elements of civilization, he passed, the Catholic man, pleasantly dedicated to the brave adventuring of minds and the salvaging of mankind. Ah, yes!",1
1440,"And how are you and the Good Woman enjoying your sojourn in the Land of the Sky?"" said the Reverend John Smallwood. Our only regret,"" said the Commoner, ""is that our visit here must be measured by days and not by months. Nay, by years. Mr. Richard Gorman, twenty-six, city reporter of The Citizen, strode rapidly up the street, with proud cold news-nose lifted.",1
1441,"His complacent smile, hard-lipped, loosened into servility. Ah, there, Dick,"" said John Smallwood, clasping his hand affectionately, and squeezing his arm. Just the man I was looking for. Do you know Mr. Bryan? As fellow newspaper men,"" said the Commoner, ""Dick and I have been close friends for--how many years is it, my boy?""  ""Three, I think, sir,"" said Mr. Gorman, blushing prettily.",1
1442,"I wish you could have been here, Dick,"" said the Reverend Smallwood, ""to hear what Mr. Bryan was saying about us. The good people of this town would be mighty proud to hear it. I'd like another statement from you before you go, Mr. Bryan,"" said Richard Gorman.",1
1443,"There's a story going the rounds that you may make your home with us in the future. When questioned by a Citizen reporter, Mr. Bryan refused either to confirm or deny the rumor:  ""I may have a statement to make later,"" he observed with a significant smile, ""but at present I must content myself by saying that if I could have chosen the place of my birth, I could not have found a fairer spot than this wonderland of nature. Earthly Paradise, thinks Commoner.",1
1444,"I have travelled far in my day,"" continued the man who had been chosen three times by a great Party to contend for the highest honor within the gift of the people. I have gone from the woods of Maine to the wave-washed sands of Florida, from Hatteras to Halifax, and from the summits of the Rockies to where Missouri rolls her turgid flood, but I have seen few spots that equal, and none that surpass, the beauty of this mountain Eden. The reporter made notes rapidly.",1
1445,"The years of his glory washed back to him upon the rolling tides of rhetoric--the great lost days of the first crusade when the money barons trembled beneath the shadow of the Cross of Gold, and Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! burned through the land like a comet. Ere I was old. 1896. Ah, woeful ere, which tells me youth's no longer here.",1
1446,"Foresees Dawn of New Era. When pressed more closely by the reporter as to his future plans, Mr. Bryan replied:  ""My schedule is completely filled, for months to come, with speaking engagements that will take me from one end of the country to the other, in the fight I am making for the reduction of the vast armaments that form the chief obstacle to the reign of peace on earth, good-will to men. After that, who knows? he said, flashing his famous smile. Perhaps I shall come back to this beautiful region, and take up my life among my good friends here as one who, having fought the good fight, deserves to spend the declining years of his life not only within sight, but within the actual boundaries, of the happy land of Canaan. Asked if he could predict with any certainty the date of his proposed retirement, the Commoner answered characteristically with the following beautiful quotation from Longfellow:        ""When the war-drum throbbed no longer,       And the battle-flags were furled       In the Parliament of man,       The Federation of the world.",1
1447,"The magic cell of music--the electric piano in the shallow tiled lobby of Altamont's favorite cinema, the Ajax, stopped playing with firm, tinny abruptness, hummed ominously for a moment, and without warning commenced anew. It's a long way to Tipperary. The world shook with the stamp of marching men.",1
1448,"Miss Margaret Blanchard and Mrs. C. M. McReady, the druggist's drugged wife who, by the white pitted fabric of her skin, and the wide bright somnolence of her eyes, on honey-dew had fed too often, came out of the theatre and turned down toward Wood's pharmacy. To-day:  Maurice Costello and Edith M. Storey in Throw Out the Lifeline, a Vitagraph Release. Goggling, his great idiot's head lolling on his scrawny neck, wearing the wide-rimmed straw hat that covered him winter and summer, Willie Goff, the pencil merchant, jerked past, with inward lunges of his crippled right foot. The fingers of his withered arm pointed stiffly toward himself, beckoning to him, and touching him as he walked with stiff jerking taps, in a terrible parody of vanity. A gaudy handkerchief with blue, yellow and crimson patterns hung in a riotous blot from his breast-pocket over his neatly belted gray Norfolk jacket, a wide loose collar of silk barred with red and orange stripes flowered across his narrow shoulders. In his lapel a huge red carnation. His thin face, beneath the jutting globular head, grinned constantly, glutting his features with wide, lapping, receding, returning, idiot smiles. For should he live a thousand years, he never will be out of humor. He burred ecstatically at the passers-by, who grinned fondly at him, and continued down to Wood's where he was greeted with loud cheers and laughter by a group of young men who loitered at the fountain's end. They gathered around him boisterously, pounding his back and drawing him up to the fountain. Pleased, he looked at them warmly, gratefully. He was touched and happy.",1
1449,"What're you having, Willie?"" said Mr. Tobias Pottle. Give me a dope,"" said Willie Goff to the grinning jerker, ""a dope and lime. Pudge Carr, the politician's son, laughed hilariously.",1
1450,"Want a dope and lime, do you, Willie?"" he said, and struck him heavily on the back. His thick stupid face composed itself. Have a cigarette, Willie,"" he said, offering the package to Willie Goff.",1
1451,"What's yours?"" said the jerker to Toby Pottle. Give me a dope, too. I don't want anything,"" said Pudge Carr.",1
1452,"Such drinks as made them nobly wild, not mad. Pudge Carr held a lighted match to Willie's cigarette, winking slowly at Brady Chalmers, a tall, handsome fellow, with black hair, and a long dark face. Willie Goff drew in on his cigarette, lighting it with dry smacking lips. He coughed, removed the weed, and held it awkwardly between his thumb and forefinger, looking at it, curiously.",1
1453,"They sputtered with laughter, involved and lost in clouds of fume, and guzzling deep, the boor, the lackey, and the groom.  Brady Chalmers took Willie's colored handkerchief gently from his pocket and held it up for their inspection. Then he folded it carefully and put it back. What are you all dressed up about, Willie?"" he said. You must be going to see your girl. Willie Goff grinned cunningly.",1
1454,"Toby Pottle blew a luxurious jet of smoke through his nostrils. He was twenty-four, carefully groomed, with slick blond hair, and a pink massaged face. Come on, Willie,"" he said, blandly, quietly, ""you've got a girl, haven't you?""  Willie Goff leered knowingly; at the counter-end, Tim McCall, twenty-eight, who had been slowly feeding cracked ice from his cupped fist into his bloated whisky-fierce jowls, collapsed suddenly, blowing a bright rattling hail upon the marble ledge.",1
1455,"I've got several,"" said Willie Goff. A fellow's got to have a little Poon-Tang, hasn't he?""  Flushed with high ringing laughter, they smiled, spoke respectfully, uncovered before Miss Tot Webster, Miss Mary McGraw, and Miss Martha Cotton, older members of the Younger Set. They called for stronger music, louder wine.",1
1456,"How do you do? Aha!  Aha!"" said Brady Chalmers to Miss Mary McGraw. Where were YOU that time? YOU'LL never know,"" she called back.",1
1457,"It was between them--their little secret. They laughed knowingly with joy of possession. Come on back, Pudge,"" said Euston Phipps, their escort. You too, Brady. He followed the ladies back--tall, bold, swagger--a young alcoholic with one sound lung. He was a good golfer.",1
1458,"Pert boys rushed from the crowded booths and tables to the fountain, coming up with a long slide. They shouted their orders rudely, nagging the swift jerkers glibly, stridently. All right, son. Two dopes and a mint Limeade. Make it snappy. Do you work around here, boy?""  The jerkers moved in ragtime tempo, juggling the drinks, tossing scooped globes of ice-cream into the air and catching them in glasses, beating swift rhythms with a spoon.",1
1459,"Seated alone, with thick brown eyes above her straw regardant, Mrs. Thelma Jarvis, the milliner, drew, in one swizzling guzzle, the last beaded chain of linked sweetness long drawn out from the bottom of her glass. Drink to me only with thine eyes. She rose slowly, looking into the mirror of her open purse. Then, fluescent, her ripe limbs moulded in a dress of silk henna, she writhed carefully among the crowded tables, with a low rich murmur of contrition. Her voice was ever soft, gentle, and low--an excellent thing in a woman. The high light chatter of the tables dropped as she went by. For God's sake, hold your tongue and let me love! On amber undulant limbs she walked slowly up the aisle past perfume, stationery, rubber goods, and toilet preparations, pausing at the cigar counter to pay her check. Her round, melon- heavy breasts nodded their heads in slow but sprightly dance. A poet could not but be gay, in such a jocund company.",1
1460,"But--at the entrance, standing in the alcove by the magazine rack, Mr. Paul Goodson, of the Dependable Life, closed his long grinning dish-face abruptly, and ceased talking. He doffed his hat without effusiveness, as did his companion, Coston Smathers, the furniture man (you furnish the girl, we furnish the house). They were both Baptists.",1
1461,"Mrs. Thelma Jarvis turned her warm ivory stare upon them, parted her full small mouth in a remote smile, and passed, ambulant. When she had gone they turned to each other, grinning quietly. We'll be waiting at the river. Swiftly they glanced about them. No one had seen.",1
1462,"Patroness of all the arts, but particular sponsor for Music, Heavenly Maid, Mrs. Franz Wilhelm Von Zeck, wife of the noted lung specialist, and the discoverer of Von Zeck's serum, came imperially from the doors of the Fashion Mart, and was handed tenderly into the receiving cushions of her Cadillac by Mr. Louis Rosalsky. Benevolently but distantly she smiled down upon him: the white parchment of his hard Polish face was broken by a grin of cruel servility curving up around the wings of his immense putty-colored nose. Frau Von Zeck settled her powerful chins upon the coarse shelving of her Wagnerian breasts and, her ponderous gaze already dreaming on remote philanthropies, was charioted smoothly away from the devoted tradesman. Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt, weiss was Ich leide.",1
1463,"Mr. Rosalsky returned into his store. For the third time the Misses Mildred Shuford, Helen Pendergast, and Mary Catherine Bruce drove by, clustered together like unpicked cherries in the front seat of Miss Shuford's Reo.

Waltz me around again, Willie.",1
1464,"Do you know how to dance, George? Eugene asked. His heart was full of bitter pride and fear.",1
1465,"Yes,"" said George Graves absently, ""a little bit. I don't like it. He lifted his brooding eyes.",1
1466,"Say, 'Gene,"" he said, ""how much do you think Dr. Von Zeck is worth?""  He answered Eugene's laughter with a puzzled sheepish grin. Come on,"" said Eugene. I'll match you for a drink. They dodged nimbly across the narrow street, amid the thickening afternoon traffic.",1
1467,"It's getting worse all the time,"" said George Graves. The people who laid the town out didn't have any vision. What's it going to be like, ten years from now?""  ""They could widen the streets, couldn't they?"" said Eugene.",1

1469,"And if we don't,"" Professor L. B. Dunn's precise voice sounded its cold warning, ""their next move will be directed against us. You may yet live to see the day when the iron heel of militarism is on your neck, and the armed forces of the Kaiser do the goose-step up and down this street. When that day comes--""  ""I don't put any stock in those stories,"" said Mr. Bob Webster rudely and irreverently.",1
1470,"He was a small man, with a gray, mean face, violent and bitter. A chronic intestinal sourness seemed to have left its print upon his features. In my opinion, it's all propaganda. Those Germans are too damn good for them, that's all. They're beginning to call for calf-rope. When that day comes,"" Professor Dunn implacably continued, ""remember what I told you.",1
1471,"The German government has imperialistic designs upon the whole of the world. It is looking to the day when it shall have all mankind under the yoke of Krupp and Kultur. The fate of civilization is hanging in the balance. Mankind is at the crossroads. I pray God it shall not be said that we were found wanting. I pray God that this free people may never suffer as little Belgium suffered, that our wives and daughters may not be led off into slavery or shame, our children maimed and slaughtered. It's not our fight,"" said Mr. Bob Webster.",1
1472,"I don't want to send my boys three thousand miles across the sea to get shot for those foreigners. If they come over here, I'll shoulder a gun with the best of them, but until they do they can fight it out among themselves. Isn't that right, Judge?"" he said, turning toward the party of the third part, Judge Walter C. Jeter, of the Federal Circuit, who had fortunately been a close friend of Grover Cleveland. Ancestral voices prophesying war.",1
1473,"Did you know the Wheeler boys? Eugene asked George Graves. Paul and Clifton?""  ""Yes,"" said George Graves.",1
1474,"They went away and joined the French army. They're in the Foreign Legion. They're in the aviation part of it,"" said Eugene.",1
1475,"The Lafayette Eskydrill. Clifton Wheeler has shot down more than six Germans. The boys around here didn't like him,"" said George Graves.",1
1476,They thought he was a sissy. Eugene winced slightly at the sound of the word. How old was he? he asked.,1
1477,"He was a grown man,"" said George. Twenty-two or three. Disappointed, Eugene considered his chance of glory.",1
1478,"(Ich bin ja noch ein Kind.) --But fortunately,"" continued Judge Walter C. Jeter deliberately, ""we have a man in the White House on whose far-seeing statesmanship we can safely rely. Let us trust to the wisdom of his leadership, obeying, in word and spirit, the principles of strict neutrality, accepting only as a last resort a course that would lead this great nation again into the suffering and tragedy of war, which,"" his voice sank to a whisper, ""God forbid!",1
1479,"Thinking of a more ancient war, in which he had borne himself gallantly, Colonel James Buchanan Pettigrew, head of the Pettigrew Military Academy (Est. 1789), rode by in his open victoria, behind an old negro driver and two well-nourished brown mares. There was a good brown smell of horse and sweat-cured leather. The old negro snaked his whip gently across the sleek trotting rumps, growling softly.",1
1480,"Colonel Pettigrew was wrapped to his waist in a heavy rug, his shoulders were covered with a gray Confederate cape. He bent forward, leaning his old weight upon a heavy polished stick, which his freckled hand gripped upon the silver knob. Muttering, his proud powerful old head turned shakily from side to side, darting fierce splintered glances at the drifting crowd. He was a very parfit gentil knight.",1
1481,"He muttered. Suh?"" said the negro, pulling in on his reins, and turning around. Go on! Go on, you scoundrel! said Colonel Pettigrew.",1
1482,"Yes, suh,"" said the negro. They drove on. In the crowd of loafing youngsters that stood across the threshold of Wood's pharmacy, Colonel Pettigrew's darting eyes saw two of his own cadets. They were pimply youths, with slack jaws and a sloppy carriage.",1
1483,"He muttered his disgust. Not the same! Not the same! Nothing the same! In his proud youth, in the only war that mattered, Colonel Pettigrew had marched at the head of his own cadets. There were 117, sir, all under nineteen. They stepped forward to a man . . . until not a single commissioned officer was left . . . 36 came back . . . since 1789 . . . it must go on! . . . 19, sir--all under one hundred and seventeen . . . must . . . go . . . on!",1
1484,"His sagging cheek-flanks trembled gently. The horses trotted out of sight around the corner, with a smooth-spoked rumble of rubber tires. George Graves and Eugene entered Wood's pharmacy and stood up to the counter. The elder soda-jerker, scowling, drew a sopping rag across a puddle of slop upon the marble slab.",1
1485,"What's yours? he said irritably. I want a chock-lut milk,"" said Eugene.",1
1486,"Make it two,"" added George Graves. O for a draught of vintage that hath been cooled a long age in the deep-delvèd earth! 25   Yes.",1
1487,"The enormous crime had been committed. And, for almost a year, Eugene had been maintaining a desperate neutrality. His heart, however, was not neutral. The fate of civilization, it appeared, hung in the balance.",1
1488,"The war had begun at the peak of the summer season. Dixieland was full. His closest friend at the time was a sharp old spinstress with frayed nerves, who had been for thirty years a teacher of English in a New York City public school. Day by day, after the murder of the Grand Duke, they watched the tides of blood and desolation mount through the world. Miss Crane's thin red nostrils quivered with indignation. Her old gray eyes were sharp with anger. The idea! The idea!",1
1489,"For, of all the English, none can show a loftier or more inspired love for Albion's Isle than American ladies who teach its noble tongue. Eugene was also faithful. With Miss Crane he kept a face of mournful regret, but his heart drummed a martial tattoo against his ribs. The air was full of fifes and flutes; he heard the ghostly throbbing of great guns.",1
1490,"We must be fair!"" said Margaret Leonard. We must be fair! But her eyes darkened when she read the news of England's entry, and her throat was trembling like a bird's. When she looked up her eyes were wet.",1
1491,"Ah, Lord!"" she said. You'll see things now. Little Bobs!"" roared Sheba.",1
1492,"God bless him! Did you see where he's going to take the field?""  John Dorsey Leonard laid down the paper, and bent over with high drooling laughter. Lord a'mercy! he gasped. Let the rascals come now!",1
1493,"Ah, well--they came. All through that waning summer, Eugene shuttled frantically from the school to Dixieland, unable, in the delirium of promised glory, to curb his prancing limbs. He devoured every scrap of news, and rushed to share it with the Leonards or Miss Crane. He read every paper he could lay his hands on, exulting in the defeats that were forcing the Germans back at every point. For, he gathered from this wilderness of print, things were going badly with the Huns. At a thousand points they fled squealing before English steel at Mons, fell suppliantly before the French charge along the Marne; withdrew here, gave way there, ran away elsewhere. Then, one morning, when they should have been at Cologne, they were lined up at the walls of Paris. They had run in the wrong direction. The world grew dark. Desperately, he tried to understand. He could not. By the extraordinary strategy of always retreating, the German army had arrived before Paris. It was something new in warfare. It was several years, in fact, before Eugene could understand that some one in the German armies had done some fighting.",1
1494,"John Dorsey Leonard was untroubled. You wait! he said confidently. You just wait, my sonny. That old fellow Joffer knows what he's about. This is just what he's been waiting for. Now he's got them where he wants them. Eugene wondered for what subtle reason a French general might want a German army in Paris.",1
1495,"Margaret lifted her troubled eyes from the paper. It looks mighty serious,"" she said. I tell you! She was silent a moment, a torrent of passion rose up in her throat. Then she added in a low trembling voice:  ""If England goes, we all go. God bless her!",1
1496,"Sheba yelled. God bless her, 'Gene,"" she continued, tapping him on the knee. When I stepped ashore on her dear old soil that time, I just couldn't help myself. I didn't care what any one thought. I knelt right down there in the dirt, and pretended to tie my shoe, but say, boy""--her bleared eyes glistened through her tears--""God bless her, I couldn't help it. Do you know what I did? I leaned over and kissed her earth. Large gummy tears rolled down her red cheeks. She was weeping loudly, but she went on. I said:  This is the earth of Shakespeare, and Milton, and John Keats and, by God, what's more, it's mine as well! God bless her! God bless her! Tears flowed quietly from Margaret Leonard's eyes.",1
1497,Her face was wet. She could not speak. They were all deeply moved.,1
1498,"She won't go,"" said John Dorsey Leonard. We'll have a word to say to that! She won't go! You wait!",1
1499,"In Eugene's fantasy there burned the fixed vision of the great hands clasped across the sea, the flowering of green fields, and the developing convolutions of a faery London--mighty, elfin, old, a romantic labyrinth of ancient crowded ways, tall, leaning houses, Lucullan food and drink, and the mad imperial eyes of genius burning among the swarm of quaint originality. As the war developed, and the literature of war-enchantment began to appear, Margaret Leonard gave him book after book to read. They were the books of the young men--the young men who fought to blot out the evil of the world with their blood. In her trembling voice she read to him Rupert Brooke's sonnet--""If I should die, think only this of me""--and she put a copy of Donald Hankey's A Student in Arms into his hand, saying:  ""Read this, boy.",1
1500,"It will stir you as you've never been stirred before. Those boys have seen the vision! He read it. He read many others. He saw the vision. He became a member of this legion of chivalry--young Galahad-Eugene--a spearhead of righteousness. He had gone a-Grailing. He composed dozens of personal memoirs, into which quietly, humorously, with fine-tempered English restraint, he poured the full measure of his pure crusading heart. Sometimes, he came through to the piping times of peace minus an arm, a leg, or an eye, diminished but ennobled; sometimes his last radiant words were penned on the eve of the attack that took his life. With glistening eyes, he read his own epilogue, enjoyed his post-mortem glory, as his last words were recorded and explained by his editor. Then, witness of his own martyrdom, he dropped two smoking tears upon his young slain body. Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.",1
1501,"Ben loped along, scowling, by Wood's pharmacy. As he passed the idling group at the tiled entrance, he cast on them a look of sudden fierce contempt. Then he laughed quietly, savagely.",1
1502,"Oh, my God!"" he said. At the corner, scowling, he waited for Mrs. Pert to cross from the Post Office. She came over slowly, reeling.",1
1503,"Having arranged to meet her later in the pharmacy, he crossed over, and turned angularly down Federal Street behind the Post Office. At the second entrance to the Doctors' and Surgeons' Building, he turned in, and began to mount the dark creaking stairs. Somewhere, with punctual developing monotony, a single drop of water was falling into the wet black basin of a sink. He paused in the wide corridor of the first floor to control the nervous thudding of his heart. Then he walked half-way down and entered the waiting-room of Dr. J. H. Coker. It was vacant. Frowning, he sniffed the air. The whole building was sharp with the clean nervous odor of antiseptics. A litter of magazines--Life, Judge, The Literary Digest, and The American--on the black mission table, told its story of weary and distressed fumbling. The inner door opened and the doctor's assistant, Miss Ray, came out. She had on her hat. She was ready to depart.",1
1504,"Do you want to see the doctor?"" she asked. Yes,"" said Ben, ""is he busy?""  ""Come on in, Ben,"" said Coker, coming to the door. He took his long wet cigar from his mouth, grinning yellowly. That's all for to-day, Laura. You can go. Good-bye,"" said Miss Laura Ray, departing.",1
1505,"Ben went into Coker's office. Coker closed the door and sat down at his untidy desk. You'll be more comfortable if you lie down on that table,"" he said grinning.",1
1506,"Ben gave the doctor's table a look of nausea. How many have died on that thing?"" he asked. He sat down nervously in a chair by the desk, and lighted a cigarette, holding the flame to the charred end of cigar Coker thrust forward.",1
1507,"Well, what can I do for you, son?"" he asked. I'm tired of pushing daisies here,"" said Ben. I want to push them somewhere else. What do you mean, Ben?""  ""I suppose you've heard, Coker,"" said Ben quietly and insultingly, ""that there's a war going on in Europe.",1
1508,"That is, if you've learned to read the papers. No, I hadn't heard about it, son,"" said Coker, puffing slowly and deeply. I read a paper--the one that comes out in the morning. I suppose they haven't got the news yet. He grinned maliciously. What do you want, Ben?""  ""I'm thinking of going to Canada and enlisting,"" said Ben.",1
1509,I want you to tell me if I can get in. Coker was silent a moment. He took the long chewed weed from his mouth and looked at it thoughtfully.,1
1510,"What do you want to do that for, Ben?"" he said. Ben got up suddenly, and went to the window. He cast his cigarette away into the court. It struck the cement well with a small dry plop. When he turned around, his sallow face had gone white and passionate.",1
1511,"In Christ's name, Coker,"" he said, ""what's it all about? Are you able to tell me? What in heaven's name are we here for? You're a doctor--you ought to know something. Coker continued to look at his cigar.",1
1512,"It had gone out again. Why?"" he said deliberately. Why should I know anything? Where do we come from?",1
1513,"Where do we go to? What are we here for? What the hell is it all about? Ben cried out furiously in a rising voice. He turned bitterly, accusingly, on the older man. For God's sake, speak up, Coker. Don't sit there like a damned tailor's dummy. Say something, won't you?""  ""What do you want me to say?"" said Coker.",1
1514,"What am I? a mindreader? A spiritualist? I'm your physician, not your priest. I've seen them born, and I've seen them die. What happens to them before or after, I can't say. Damn that!"" said Ben.  ""What happens to them in between?""  ""You're as great an authority on that as I am, Ben,"" said Coker.",1
1515,"What you want, son, is not a doctor, but a prophet. They come to you when they're sick, don't they?"" said Ben. They all want to get well, don't they? You do your best to cure them, don't you?""  ""No,"" said Coker.",1
1516,"Not always. But I'll grant that I'm supposed to. What of it?""  ""You must all think that it's about something,"" said Ben, ""or you wouldn't do it!""  ""A man must live, mustn't he?"" said Coker with a grin.",1
1517,"That's what I'm asking you, Coker. Why must he?""  ""Why,"" said Coker, ""in order to work nine hours a day in a newspaper office, sleep nine hours, and enjoy the other six in washing, shaving, dressing, eating at the Greasy Spoon, loafing in front of Wood's, and occasionally taking the Merry Widow to see Francis X. Bushman. Isn't that reason enough for any man? If a man's hard-working and decent, and invests his money in the Building and Loan every week, instead of squandering it on cigarettes, coca-cola, and Kuppenheimer clothes, he may own a little home some day. Coker's voice sank to a hush of reverence. He may even have his own car, Ben.  Think of that! He can get in it, and ride, and ride, and ride. He can ride all over these damned mountains. He can be very, very happy. He can take exercise regularly in the Y. M. C. A. and think only clean thoughts. He can marry a good pure woman and have any number of fine sons and daughters, all of whom may be brought up in the Baptist, Methodist, or Presbyterian faiths, and given splendid courses in Economics, Commercial Law, and the Fine Arts, at the State university. There's plenty to live for, Ben. There's something to keep you busy every moment. You're a great wit, Coker,"" Ben said, scowling.",1
1518,"You're as funny as a crutch. He straightened his humped shoulders self- consciously, and filled his lungs with air. Well, what about it? he asked, with a nervous grin. Am I fit to go?""  ""Let's see,"" said Coker deliberately, beginning to look him over.",1
1519,"Feet--pigeon-toed, but good arch.""  He looked at Ben's tan leathers closely. What's the matter, Coker?"" said Ben.  Do you need your toes to shoot a gun with?""  ""How're your teeth, son?""  Ben drew back his thin lips and showed two rows of hard white grinders.",1
1520,"At the same moment, casually, swiftly, Coker prodded him with a strong yellow finger in the solar plexis. His distended chest collapsed; he bent over, laughing, and coughed dryly. Coker turned away to his desk and picked up his cigar.",1
1521,"What's the matter, Coker?"" said Ben.  What's the idea? That's all, son.",1
1522,"I'm through with you,"" said Coker. Well, what about it?"" said Ben nervously. What about what?""  ""Am I all right?",1
1523,"Certainly you're all right,"" said Coker. He turned with burning match. Who said you weren't all right?""  Ben stared at him, scowling, with fear-bright eyes.",1
1524,"Quit your kidding, Coker,"" he said. I'm three times seven, you know. Am I fit to go?""  ""What's the rush?"" said Coker.",1
1525,"The war's not over yet. We may get into it before long. Why not wait a bit?""  ""That means I'm not fit,"" said Ben.",1
1526,"What's the matter with me, Coker?""  ""Nothing,"" said Coker carefully. You're a bit thin. A little run down, aren't you, Ben? You need a little meat on those bones, son. You can't sit on a stool at the Greasy Spoon, with a cigarette in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other, and get fat. Am I all right or not, Coker?""  Coker's long death's-head widened in a yellow grin.",1
1527,"Yes,"" he said. You're all right, Ben. You're one of the most all right people I know. Ben read the true answer in Coker's veined and weary eyes.",1
1528,"His own were sick with fear. But he said bitingly:  ""Thanks, Coker. You're a lot of help. I appreciate what you've done a lot. As a doctor, you're a fine first baseman. Coker grinned.",1
1529,"Ben left the office. As he went out on the street he met Harry Tugman going down to the paper office. What's the matter, Ben?"" said Harry Tugman. Feeling sick?""  ""Yes,"" said Ben, scowling at him.",1
1530,"I've just had a shot of 606. He went up the street to meet Mrs. Pert. 26   In the autumn, at the beginning of his fifteenth year--his last year at Leonard's--Eugene went to Charleston on a short excursion.",1
1531,"He found a substitute for his paper route. Come on!"" said Max Isaacs, whom he still occasionally saw. We're going to have a good time, son. Yeah, man!"" said Malvin Bowden, whose mother was conducting the tour.",1
1532,"You can still git beer in Charleston,"" he added with a dissipated leer. You can go swimmin' in the ocean at the Isle of Palms,"" said Max Isaacs. Then, reverently, he added:  ""You can go to the Navy Yard an' see the ships. He was waiting until he should be old enough to join the navy.",1
1533,"He read the posters greedily. He knew all the navy men at the enlistment office. He had read all the booklets--he was deep in naval lore. He knew to a dollar the earnings of firemen, second class, of radio men, and of all kinds of C. P. O's.",1
1534,"His father was a plumber. He did not want to be a plumber. He wanted to join the navy and see the world. In the navy, a man was given good pay and a good education. He learned a trade. He got good food and good clothing. It was all given to him free, for nothing.",1
1535,"H'm!"" said Eliza, with a bantering smile. Why, say, boy, what do you want to do that for? You're my baby!",1
1536,"It had been years since he was. She smiled tremulously. Yes'm,"" said Eugene. Can I go? It's only for five days. I've got the money. He thrust his hand into his pocket, feeling.",1
1537,"I tell you what!"" said Eliza, working her lips, smiling. You may wish you had that money before this winter's over. You're going to need new shoes and a warm overcoat when the cold weather comes. You must be mighty rich. I wish I could afford to go running off on a trip like that. Oh, my God!"" said Ben, with a short laugh.",1
1538,"He tossed his cigarette into one of the first fires of the year. I want to tell you, son,"" said Eliza, becoming grave, ""you've got to learn the value of a dollar or you'll never have a roof to call your own. I want you to have a good time, boy, but you mustn't squander your money. Yes'm,"" said Eugene.",1
1539,"For heaven's sake! Ben cried. It's the kid's own money. Let him do what he likes with it. If he wants to throw it out the damned window, it's his own business. She clasped her hands thoughtfully upon her waist and stared away, pursing her lips.",1
1540,"Well, I reckon it'll be all right,"" she said. Mrs. Bowden will take care of you. It was his first journey to a strange place alone.",1
1541,"Eliza packed an old valise carefully, and stowed away a box of sandwiches and eggs. He went away at night. As he stood by his valise, washed, brushed, excited, she wept a little. He was again, she felt, a little farther off. The hunger for voyages was in his face.",1
1542,"Be a good boy,"" she said. Don't get into any trouble down there. She thought carefully a moment, looking away. Then she went down in her stocking, and pulled out a five-dollar bill.",1
1543,"Don't waste your money,"" she said. Here's a little extra. You may need it. Come here, you little thug!"" said Ben.  Scowling, his quick hands worked busily at the boy's stringy tie.",1
1544,"He jerked down his vest, slipping a wadded ten-dollar bill into Eugene's pocket. Behave yourself,"" he said, ""or I'll beat you to death. Max Isaacs whistled from the street.",1
1545,"He went out to join them. There were six in Mrs. Bowden's party:  Max Isaacs, Malvin Bowden, Eugene, two girls named Josie and Louise, and Mrs. Bowden. Josie was Mrs. Bowden's niece and lived with her. She was a tall beanpole of a girl with a prognathous mouth and stick-out grinning teeth. She was twenty. The other girl, Louise, was a waitress. She was small, plump, a warm brunette. Mrs. Bowden was a little sallow woman with ratty brown hair. She had brown worn-out eyes. She was a dressmaker. Her husband, a carpenter, had died in the Spring. There was a little insurance money. That was how she came to take the trip.",1
1546,"Now, by night, he was riding once more into the South. The day- coach was hot, full of the weary smell of old red plush. People dozed painfully, distressed by the mournful tolling of the bell, and the grinding halts. A baby wailed thinly. Its mother, a gaunt wisp-haired mountaineer, turned the back of the seat ahead, and bedded the child on a spread newspaper. Its wizened face peeked dirtily out of its swaddling discomfort of soiled jackets and pink ribbon. It wailed and slept. At the front of the car, a young hill-man, high-boned and red, clad in corduroys and leather leggings, shelled peanuts steadily, throwing the shells into the aisle. People trod through them with a sharp masty crackle. The boys, bored, paraded restlessly to the car-end for water. There was a crushed litter of sanitary drinking-cups upon the floor, and a stale odor from the toilets.",1
1547,"The two girls slept soundly on turned seats. The small one breathed warmly and sweetly through moist parted lips. The weariness of the night wore in upon their jaded nerves, lay upon their dry hot eyeballs. They flattened noses against the dirty windows, and watched the vast structure of the earth sweep past--clumped woodlands, the bending sweep of the fields, the huge flowing lift of the earth-waves, cyclic intersections bewildering-- the American earth--rude, immeasurable, formless, mighty.",1
1548,"His mind was bound in the sad lulling magic of the car wheels. Clackety-clack. Clackety-clack. Clackety-clack. Clackety-clack. He thought of his life as something that had happened long ago. He had found, at last, his gateway to the lost world. But did it lie before or behind him? Was he leaving or entering it? Above the rhythm of the wheels he thought of Eliza's laughter over ancient things. He saw a brief forgotten gesture, her white broad forehead, a ghost of old grief in her eyes. Ben, Gant--their strange lost voices. Their sad laughter. They swam toward him through green walls of fantasy. They caught and twisted at his heart. The green ghost-glimmer of their faces coiled away. Lost. Lost.",1
1549,"Let's go for a smoke,"" said Max Isaacs. They went back and stood wedged for stability on the closed platform of the car. They lighted cigarettes.",1
1550,"Light broke against the east, in a murky rim. The far dark was eaten cleanly away. The horizon sky was barred with hard fierce strips of light. Still buried in night, they looked across at the unimpinging sheet of day. They looked under the lifted curtain at brightness. They were knifed sharply away from it. Then, gently, light melted across the land like dew. The world was gray.",1
1551,"The east broke out in ragged flame. In the car, the little waitress breathed deeply, sighed, and opened her clear eyes. Max Isaacs fumbled his cigarette awkwardly, looked at Eugene, and grinned sheepishly with delight, craning his neck along his collar, and making a nervous grimace of his white fuzz-haired face. His hair was thick, straight, the color of taffy. He had blond eyebrows. There was much kindness in him. They looked at each other with clumsy tenderness. They thought of the lost years at Woodson Street. They saw with decent wonder their awkward bulk of puberty. The proud gate of the years swung open for them. They felt a lonely glory. They said farewell.",1
1552,"Charleston, fat weed that roots itself on Lethe wharf, lived in another time. The hours were days, the days weeks. They arrived in the morning. By noon, several weeks had passed, and he longed for the day's ending. They were quartered in a small hotel on King Street--an old place above stores, with big rooms. After lunch, they went out to see the town. Max Isaacs and Malvin Bowden turned at once toward the Navy Yard. Mrs. Bowden went with them. Eugene was weary for sleep. He promised to meet them later.",1
1553,"When they had gone, he pulled off his shoes and took off his coat and shirt, and lay down to sleep in a big dark room, into which the warm sun fell in shuttered bars. Time droned like a sleepy October fly. At five o'clock, Louise, the little waitress, came to wake him. She, too, had wanted to sleep. She knocked gently at the door. When he did not answer, she opened it quietly and came in, closing it behind her. She came to the side of the bed and looked at him for a moment.",1
1554,"Eugene! she whispered. Eugene. He murmured drowsily, and stirred.",1
1555,"The little waitress smiled and sat down on the bed. She bent over him and tickled him gently in the ribs, chuckling to see him squirm. Then she tickled the soles of his feet. He wakened slowly, yawning, rubbing sleep from his eyes.",1
1556,"What is it?"" he said. It's time to go out there,"" she said. Out where?""  ""To the Navy Yard.",1
1557,"We promised to meet them. Oh, damn the Navy Yard! he groaned. I'd rather sleep. So would I!"" she agreed.",1
1558,"She yawned luxuriously, stretching her plump arms above her head. I'm so sleepy. I could stretch out anywhere. She looked meaningly at the bed.",1
1559,"He wakened at once, sensuously alert. He lifted himself upon one elbow: a hot torrent of blood swarmed through his cheeks. His pulses beat thickly.",1
1560,"We're all alone up here,"" said Louise smiling. We've got the whole floor to ourselves. Why don't you lie down and take a nap, if you're still sleepy?"" he asked.",1
1561,"I'll wake you up,"" he added, with gentle chivalry. I've got such a little room. It's hot and stuffy. That's why I got up,"" said Louise. What a nice big room you've got!""  ""Yes,"" he said.",1
1562,"It's a nice big bed, too. They were silent a waiting moment. Why don't you lie down here, Louise?"" he said, in a low unsteady voice. I'll get up,"" he added hastily, sitting up. I'll wake you. Oh, no,"" she said, ""I wouldn't feel right.",1
1563,"They were again silent. She looked admiringly at his thin young arms. My! she said. I bet you're strong. He flexed his long stringy muscles manfully, and expanded his chest.",1
1564,"My! she said. How old are you, 'Gene?""  He was just at his fifteenth year.",1
1565,"I'm going on sixteen,"" he said. How old are you, Louise?""  ""I'm eighteen,"" she said. I bet you're a regular heart-breaker, 'Gene. How many girls have you got?""  ""Oh--I don't know.",1
1566,"Not many,"" he said truthfully enough. He wanted to talk--he wanted to talk madly, seductively, wickedly. He would excite her by uttering, in grave respectful tones, honestly, matter-of-factly, the most erotic suggestions.",1
1567,"I guess you like the tall ones, don't you?"" said Louise. A tall fellow wouldn't want a little thing like me, would he? Although,"" she said quickly, ""you never know. They say opposites attract each other. I don't like tall girls,"" said Eugene.",1
1568,"They're too skinny. I like them about your size, when they've got a good build. Have I got a good build, 'Gene?"" said Louise, holding her arms up and smiling.",1
1569,"Yes, you have a pretty build, Louise--a fine build,"" said Eugene earnestly. The kind I like. I haven't got a pretty face.",1
1570,"I've got an ugly face,"" she said invitingly. You haven't got an ugly face. You have a pretty face,"" said Eugene firmly. Anyway, the face doesn't matter much with me,"" he added, subtly.",1
1571,"What do you like best, 'Gene? Louise asked. He thought carefully and gravely.",1
1572,"Why,"" he said, ""a woman ought to have pretty legs. Sometimes a woman has an ugly face, but a pretty leg. The prettiest legs I ever saw were on a High Yellow. Were they prettier than mine?"" said the waitress, with an easy laugh.",1
1573,"She crossed her legs slowly and displayed her silk-shod ankle. I don't know, Louise,"" he said, staring critically. I can't see enough. Is that enough?",1
1574,"she said, pulling her tight skirt above her calves. No,"" said Eugene. Is that? she pulled her skirt back over her knees, and displayed her plump thighs, gartered with a ruffled band of silk and red rosettes. She thrust her small feet out, coyly turning the toes in.",1
1575,"Lord!"" said Eugene, staring with keen interest at the garter. I never saw any like that before. That's pretty. He gulped noisily. Don't those things hurt you, Louise?""  ""Uh-uh,"" she said, as if puzzled, ""why?""  ""I should think they'd cut into your skin,"" he said.",1
1576,"I know mine do if I wear them too tight. See. He pulled up his trousers' leg and showed his young gartered shank, lightly spired with hair.",1
1577,"Louise looked, and felt the garter gravely with a plump hand. Mine don't hurt me,"" she said. She snapped the elastic with a ripe smack. See!""  ""Let me see,"" he said.",1
1578,"He placed his trembling fingers lightly upon her garter. Yes,"" he said unsteadily. I see. Her round young weight lay heavy against him, her warm young face turned blindly up to his own.",1
1579,"His brain reeled as if drunken, he dropped his mouth awkwardly upon her parted lips. She sank back heavily on the pillows. He planted dry and clumsy kisses upon her mouth, her eyes, in little circles round her throat and face. He fumbled at the throat-hook of her waist, but his fingers shook so violently that he could not unfasten it. She lifted her smooth hands with a comatose gesture, and unfastened it for him.",1
1580,"Then he lifted his beet-red face, and whispered tremulously, not knowing well what he said: You're a nice girl, Louise. A pretty girl. She thrust her pink fingers slowly through his hair, drew back his face into her breasts again, moaned softly as he kissed her, and clutched his hair in an aching grip.",1
1581,"He put his arms around her and drew her to him. They devoured each other with young wet kisses, insatiate, unhappy, trying to grow together in their embrace, draw out the last distillation of desire in a single kiss. He lay sprawled, scattered and witless with passion, unable to collect and focus his heat. He heard the wild tongueless cries of desire, the inchoate ecstasy that knows no gateway of release. But he knew fear--not the social fear, but the fear of ignorance, of discovery. He feared his potency. He spoke to her thickly, wildly, not hearing himself speak.",1
1582,"Do you want me to? Do you want me to, Louise?""  She drew his face down, murmuring:  ""You won't hurt me, 'Gene? You wouldn't do anything to hurt me, honey? If anything happens--"" she said drowsily.",1
1583,"He seized the straw of her suggestion. I won't be the first. I won't be the one to begin you. I've never started a girl off,"" he babbled, aware vaguely that he was voicing an approved doctrine of chivalry. See here, Louise! he shook her--she seemed drugged. You've got to tell me before--. I won't do THAT! I may be a bad fellow, but nobody can say I ever did that. Do you hear! His voice rose shrilly; his face worked wildly; he was hardly able to speak.",1
1584,"I say, do you hear? Am I the first one, or not? You've got to answer! Did you ever--before?""  She looked at him lazily.",1
1585,"She smiled. No,"" she said. I may be mad, but I won't do that. He had become inarticulate; his voice went off into a speechless jargon. Gasping, stammering, with contorted and writhing face, he sought for speech.",1
1586,"She rose suddenly, and put her warm arms comfortingly around him. Soothing and caressing him, she drew him down on her breast. She stroked his head, and talked quietly to him.",1
1587,"I know you wouldn't, honey. I know you wouldn't. Don't talk. Don't say anything. Why, you're all excited, dear. There. Why, you're shaking like a leaf. You're high-strung, honey. That's what it is. You're a bundle of nerves. He wept soundlessly into her arm.",1
1588,"He became quieter. She smiled, and kissed him softly. Put on your clothes,"" said Louise. We ought to get started if we're going out there. In his confusion he tried to draw on a pair of Mrs. Bowden's cast- off pumps.",1
1589,"Louise laughed richly, and thrust her fingers through his hair. At the Navy Yard, they could not find the Bowdens nor Max Isaacs. A young sailor took them over a destroyer. Louise went up a railed iron ladder with an emphatic rhythm of her shapely thighs. She showed her legs. She stared impudently at a picture of a chorus lady, cut from the Police Gazette. The young sailor rolled his eyes aloft with an expression of innocent debauchery. Then he winked heavily at Eugene.",1
1590,"The deck of the Oregon. What's that for?"" said Louise, pointing to the outline in nails of Admiral Dewey's foot. That's where he stood during the fight,"" said the sailor.",1
1591,"Louise put her small foot within the print of the greater one. The sailor winked at Eugene. You may fire when you are ready, Gridley.",1
1592,"She's a nice girl,"" said Eugene. Yeah,"" said Max Isaacs. She's a nice lady. He craned his neck awkwardly, and squinted. About how old is she?""  ""She's eighteen,"" said Eugene.",1
1593,"Malvin Bowden stared at him. You're crazy!"" said he. She's twenty-one. No,"" said Eugene, ""she's eighteen.",1
1594,"She told me so. I don't care,"" said Malvin Bowden, ""she's no such thing. She's twenty-one. I reckon I ought to know. My folks have known her for five years. She had a baby when she was eighteen. Aw!"" said Max Isaacs.",1
1595,"Yes,"" said Malvin Bowden, ""a travelling man got her in trouble. Then he ran away. Aw!"" said Max Isaacs.",1
1596,"Without marryin' her or anything?""  ""He didn't do nothing for her. He ran away,"" said Malvin Bowden. Her people are raising the kid now. Great Day!"" said Max Isaacs slowly.",1
1597,"Then, sternly, he added, ""A man who'd do a thing like that ought to be shot. You're right!"" said Malvin Bowden. They loafed along the Battery, along the borders of ruined Camelot.",1
1598,"Those are nice old places,"" said Max Isaacs. They've been good houses in their day. He looked greedily at wrought-iron gateways; the old lust of his childhood for iron-scraps awoke.",1
1599,"Those are old Southern mansions,"" said Eugene, reverently. The bay was still: there was a green stench of warm standing water. They've let the place run down,"" said Malvin. It's no bigger now than it was before the Civil War. No, sir, and, by heaven, so long as one true Southern heart is left alive to remember Appomattox, Reconstruction, and the Black parliaments, we will defend with our dearest blood our menaced, but sacred, traditions.",1
1600,"They need some Northern capital,"" said Max Isaacs sagely. They all did. An old woman, wearing a tiny bonnet, was led out on a high veranda from one of the houses, by an attentive negress. She seated herself in a porch rocker and stared blindly into the sun. Eugene looked at her sympathetically. She had probably not been informed by her loyal children of the unsuccessful termination of the war. United in their brave deception, they stinted themselves daily, reining in on their proud stomachs in order that she might have all the luxury to which she had been accustomed. What did she eat? The wing of a chicken, no doubt, and a glass of dry sherry. Meanwhile, all the valuable heirlooms had been pawned or sold. Fortunately, she was almost blind, and could not see the wastage of their fortune. It was very sad. But did she not sometimes think of that old time of the wine and the roses? When knighthood was in flower?  ""Look at that old lady,"" whispered Malvin Bowden.",1
1601,"You can TELL she's a lady,"" said Max Isaacs. I bet she's never turned her hand over. An old family,"" said Eugene gently.",1
1602,"The Southern aristocracy. An old negro came by, fringed benevolently by white whiskers. A good old man--an ante-bellum darkey. Dear Lord, their number was few in these unhappy days.",1
1603,"Eugene thought of the beautiful institution of human slavery, which his slaveless maternal ancestry had fought so valiantly to preserve. Bress de Lawd, Marse! Ole Mose doan' wan' to be free niggah. How he goan' lib widout marse? He doan' wan' stahve wid free niggahs. Har, har, har!  Philanthropy.",1
1604,"Pure philanthropy. He brushed a tear from his een. They were going across the harbor to the Isle of Palms. As the boat churned past the round brick cylinder of Fort Sumter, Malvin Bowden said:  ""They had the most men.",1
1605,"If things had been even, we'd have beaten them. They didn't beat us,"" said Max Isaacs. We wore ourselves out beating them. We were defeated,"" said Eugene, quietly, ""not beaten.",1
1606,"Max Isaacs stared at him dumbly. Aw!"" he said. They left the little boat, and ground away toward the beach in a street-car. The land had grown dry and yellow in the enervation of the summer. The foliage was coated with dust: they rattled past cheap summer houses, baked and blistered, stogged drearily in the sand. They were small, flimsy, a multitudinous vermin--all with their little wooden sign of lodging. The Ishkabibble,"" ""Seaview,"" ""Rest Haven,"" ""Atlantic Inn,""--Eugene looked at them, reading with weariness the bleached and jaded humor of their names.",1
1607,"There are a lot of boarding-houses in the world,"" said he. A hot wind of beginning autumn rustled dryly through the long parched leaves of stunted palms. Before them rose the huge rusted spokes of a Ferris Wheel. St. Louis. They had reached the beach.",1
1608,"Malvin Bowden leaped joyously from the car. Last one in's a rotten egg! he cried, and streaked for the bathhouse.",1
1609,"Kings! I've got kings, son,"" yelled Max Isaacs. He held up his crossed fingers. The beach was bare: two or three concessions stood idly open for business. The sky curved over them, a cloudless blue burnished bowl. The sea offshore was glazed emerald: the waves rode heavily in, thickening murkily as they turned with sunlight and sediment to a beachy yellow.",1
1610,"They walked slowly down the beach toward the bathhouse. The tranquil, incessant thunder of the sea made in them a lonely music. Seawards, their eyes probed through the seething glare.",1
1611,"I'm going to join the navy, 'Gene,"" said Max Isaacs. Come on and go with me. I'm not old enough,"" said Eugene.",1
1612,"You're not, either. I'll be sixteen in November,"" said Max Isaacs defensively. 'That's not old enough. I'm going to lie to get in,"" said Max Isaacs.",1
1613,"They won't bother you. You can get in. Come on. No,"" said Eugene.",1
1614,"I can't. Why not?"" said Max Isaacs. What are you going to do?""  ""I'm going to college,"" said Eugene.",1
1615,"I'm going to get an education and study law. You'll have lots of time,"" said Max Isaacs. You can go to college when you come out. They teach you a lot in the navy. They give you a good training. You go everywhere. No,"" said Eugene.",1
1616,"I can't.  But his pulse throbbed as he listened to the lonely thunder of the sea. He saw strange dusky faces, palm frondage, and heard the little tinkling sounds of Asia. He believed in harbors at the end.",1
1617,"Mrs. Bowden's niece and the waitress came out on the next car. After his immersion he lay, trembling slightly under the gusty wind, upon the beach. A fine tang of salt was on his lips. He licked his clean young flesh.",1
1618,"Louise came from the bathhouse and walked slowly toward him. She came proudly, her warm curves moulded into her bathing-suit: her legs were covered with stockings of green silk. Far out, beyond the ropes, Max Isaacs lifted his white heavy arms, and slid swiftly through a surging wall of green water. His body glimmered greenly for a moment; he stood erect wiping his eyes and shaking water from his ears.",1
1619,"Eugene took the waitress by the hand and led her into the water. She advanced slowly, with little twittering cries. An undulant surge rolled in deceptively, and rose suddenly to her chin, drinking her breath. She gasped and clung to him. Initiated, they bucked deliciously through a roaring wall of water, and, while her eyes were still closed, he caught her to him with young salty kisses.",1
1620,"Presently they came out, and walked over the wet strip of beach into the warm loose sand, bedding their dripping bodies gratefully in its warmth. The waitress shivered: he moulded sand over her legs and hips, until she was half buried. He kissed her, stilling his trembling lips upon her mouth.",1
1621,I like you! I like you a lot! he said.,1
1622,"What did they tell you about me?"" she said. Did they talk about me?""  ""I don't care,"" he said. I don't care about that. I like you. You won't remember me, honey, when you start going with the girls.",1
1623,"You'll forget about me. Some day you'll see me, and you won't even know me. You won't recognize me. You'll pass without speaking. No,"" he said.",1
1624,"I'll never forget you, Louise. So long as I live. Their hearts were filled with the lonely thunder of the sea.",1
1625,She kissed him. They were hill-born. He returned in late September.,1
1626,"In October, Gant, with Ben and Helen, departed for Baltimore. The operation, too long deferred, was now inevitable. His disease had grown steadily worse. He had gone through a period of incessant pain. He was enfeebled. He was frightened.",1
1627,"Rising at night, he would rouse the sleeping house with his cries, commanding terror with his old magnificence. I see it! I see it! The knife! The knife! . . . Do you see its shadow? . . . There! There! There!""  With Boothian gusto he recoiled, pointing to invulnerable nothings.",1
1628,"Do you see him standing there in the shadows? So you've come at last to take the old man with you? . . . There he stands--the Grim Reaper--as I always knew he would. Jesus, have mercy on my soul!""    Gant lay in a long cot in the Urological Institute at Johns Hopkins.",1
1629,Every day a cheerful little man came briskly in and looked at his chart. He talked happily and went away. He was one of the greatest surgeons in the country.,1
1630,"Don't worry,"" said the nurse encouragingly, ""the mortality's only four per cent. It used to be thirty. He's reduced it. Gant groaned, and slipped his big hand into his daughter's vital grasp.",1
1631,"Don't worry, old boy! she said, ""you're going to be as good as you ever were, after this. She fed him with her life, her hope, her love.",1
1632,"He was almost tranquil when they wheeled him in to his operation. But the little gray-haired man looked, shook his head regretfully, and trimmed deftly. All right! he said, four minutes later, to his assistant. Close the wound. Gant was dying of cancer.",1
1633,"Gant sat in a wheeled chair upon the high fifth-floor veranda, looking out through bright October air at the city spread far into the haze before him. He looked very clean, almost fragile. A faint grin of happiness and relief hovered about his thin mouth. He smoked a long cigar, with fresh-awakened senses.",1
1634,"There,"" he said pointing, ""is where I spent part of my boyhood. Old Jeff Streeter's hotel stood about there,"" he pointed. Dig down! said Helen, grinning.",1
1635,"Gant thought of the years between, and the vexed pattern of fate. His life seemed strange to him. We'll go to see all those places when you get out of here. They're going to let you out of here, day after to-morrow. Did you know that? Did you know you're almost well? she cried with a big smile.",1
1636,"I'm going to be a well man after this,"" said Gant. I feel twenty years younger! Poor old papa!",1
1637,"she said. Poor old papa! Her eyes were wet. She put her big hands on his face, and drew his head against her.",1
1638,"27   My Shakespeare, rise! He rose. The bard rose throughout the length and breadth of his brave new world. He was not for an age, but for all time. Then, too, his tercentenary happened only once-- at the end of three hundred years. It was observed piously from Maryland to Oregon. Eighty-one members of the House of Representatives, when asked by literate journalists for their favorite lines, replied instantly with a quotation from Polonius: ""This above all: to thine own self be true. The Swan was played, and pageanted, and essayed in every schoolhouse in the land.",1
1639,"Eugene tore the Chandos portrait from the pages of the Independent and nailed it to the calcimined wall of the backroom. Then, still full of the great echoing paean of Ben Jonson's, he scrawled below it in large trembling letters:  ""My Shakespeare, rise! The large plump face--""as damned silly a head as ever I looked at""--stared baldly at him with goggle eyes, the goatee pointed ripe with hayseed vanity. But, lit by the presence, Eugene plunged back into the essay littered across his table.",1
1640,"He was discovered. In an unwise absence, he left the Bard upon the wall. When he returned, Ben and Helen had read his scrawl. Thereafter, he was called poetically to table, to the telephone, to go an errand.",1
1641,"My Shakespeare, rise!""  With red resentful face, he rose. Will My Shakespeare pass the biscuit?"" or, ""Could I trouble My Shakespeare for the butter?"" said Ben, scowling at him. My Shakespeare! My Shakespeare! Do you want another piece of pie?"" said Helen. Then, full of penitent laughter, she added: ""That's a shame! We oughtn't to treat the poor kid like that.  Laughing, she plucked at her large straight chin, gazing out the window, and laughing absently--penitently, laughing.",1
1642,"But--""his art was universal. He saw life clearly and he saw it whole. He was an intellectual ocean whose waves touched every shore of thought. He was all things in one: lawyer, merchant, soldier, doctor, statesman. Men of science have been amazed by the depth of his learning. In The Merchant of Venice, he deals with the most technical questions of law with the skill of an attorney. In King Lear, he boldly prescribes sleep as a remedy for Lear's insanity. 'Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleave of care.' Thus, he has foreseen the latest researches of modern science by almost three centuries. In his sympathetic and well-rounded sense of characterization, he laughs with, not at, his characters. Eugene won the medal--bronze or of some other material even more enduring.",1
1643,The Bard's profile murkily indented. W. S.  1616-1916. A long and useful life.,1
1644,"The machinery of the pageant was beautiful and simple. Its author-- Dr. George B. Rockham, at one time, it was whispered, a trouper with the Ben Greet players--had seen to that. All the words had been written by Dr. George B. Rockham, and all the words, accordingly, had been written for Dr. George B. Rockham. Dr. George B. Rockham was the Voice of History. The innocent children of Altamont's schools were the mute illustrations of that voice.",1
1645,"Eugene was Prince Hal. The day before the pageant his costume arrived from Philadelphia. At John Dorsey Leonard's direction he put it on. Then he came out sheepishly before John Dorsey on the school veranda, fingering his tin sword and looking somewhat doubtfully at his pink silk hose which came three quarters up his skinny shanks, and left exposed, below his doublet, a six-inch hiatus of raw thigh.",1
1646,"John Dorsey Leonard looked gravely. Here, boy,"" he said. Let me see!",1
1647,"He pulled strongly at the top of the deficient hose, with no result save to open up large runs in them. Then John Dorsey Leonard began to laugh. He slid helplessly down upon the porch rail, and bent over, palsied with silent laughter, from which a high whine, full of spittle, presently emerged.",1
1648,"O-oh my Lord! he gasped. Egscuse me! he panted, seeing the boy's angry face. It's the funniest thing I ever--"" at this moment his voice died of paralysis.",1
1649,"I'll fix you,"" said Miss Amy. I've got just the thing for you. She gave him a full baggy clown's suit, of green linen.",1
1650,"It was a relic of a Hallowe'en party; its wide folds were gartered about his ankles. He turned a distressed, puzzled face toward Miss Amy. That's not right, is it? he asked. He never wore anything like this, did he?""  Miss Amy looked.",1
1651,"Her deep bosom heaved with full contralto laughter. Yes, that's right! That's fine! she yelled. He was like that, anyway. No one will ever notice, boy. She collapsed heavily into a wicker chair which widened with a protesting creak.",1
1652,"Oh, Lord!"" she groaned, wet-cheeked. I don't believe I ever saw--""    The pageant was performed on the embowered lawns of the Manor House. Dr. George B. Rockham stood in a green hollow--a natural amphitheatre. His audience sat on the turf of the encircling banks. As the phantom cavalcade of poetry and the drama wound down to him, Dr. George B. Rockham disposed of each character neatly in descriptive pentameter verse. He was dressed in the fashion of the Restoration--a period he coveted because it understood the charms of muscular calves. His heavy legs bulged knottily below a coy fringe of drawer-ruffles.",1
1653,"Eugene stood waiting on the road above, behind an obscuring wall of trees. It was rich young May. Doc"" Hines (Falstaff) waited beside him. His small tough face grinned apishly over garments stuffed with yards of wadding. Grinning, he smote himself upon his swollen paunch: the blow left a dropsical depression.",1
1654,"He turned, with a comical squint, on Eugene:  ""Hal,"" said he, ""you're a hell of a looking prince. You're no beauty, Jack,"" said Eugene. Behind him, Julius Arthur (Macbeth), drew his sword with a flourish.",1
1655,"I challenge you, Hal,"" said he. In the young shimmering light their tin swords clashed rapidly. Twittered with young bird-laughter, on bank and saddle sprawled, all of the Bard's personæ. Julius Arthur thrust swiftly, was warded, then, with loose grin, buried his brand suddenly in ""Doc"" Hines' receiving paunch. The company of the immortal shrieked happily.",1
1656,"Miss Ida Nelson, the assistant director, rushed angrily among them. Sh! she hissed loudly. Sh-h! She was very angry. She had spent the afternoon hissing loudly.",1
1657,"Swinging gently in her side-saddle, Rosalind, on horseback, a ripe little beauty from the convent, smiled warmly at him. Looking, he forgot. Below them, on the road, the crowded press loosened slowly, broke off in minute fragments, and disappeared into the hidden gulch of Dr. George Rockham's receiving voice. With fat hammy sonority he welcomed them.",1
1658,"But he had not come to Shakespeare. The pageant had opened with the Voices of Past and Present--voices a trifle out of harmony with the tenor of event--but necessary to the commercial success of the enterprise. These voices now moved voicelessly past--four frightened sales-ladies from Schwartzberg's, clad decently in cheese-cloth and sandals, who came by bearing the banner of their concern. Or, as the doctor's more eloquent iambics had it:        ""Fair Commerce, sister of the arts, thou, too,       Shalt take thy lawful place upon our stage.",1
1659,"They came and passed:  Ginsberg's--""the glass of fashion and the mould of form""; Bradley the Grocer--""when first Pomona held her fruity horn""; The Buick Agency--""the chariots of Oxus and of Ind.""  Came, passed--like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream. Behind them, serried ranks of cherubim, the marshalled legions of Altamont's Sunday schools, each in white arrayed and clutching grimly in tiny hands two thousand tiny flags of freedom, God's small angels, and surely there for God knows what far-off event, began to move into the hollow. Their teachers nursed them gently into action, with tapping feet and palms.",1
1660,"One, two, THREE, four.  One, two, THREE, four. Quickly, children! A hidden orchestra, musical in the trees, greeted them, as they approached, with holy strains: the Baptists, with the simple doctrine of ""It's the Old-time Religion""; the Methodists, with ""I'll Be Waiting at the River""; the Presbyterians, with ""Rock of Ages,"" the Episcopalians, with ""Jesus, Lover of My Soul""; and rising to lyrical climactic passion, the little Jews, with the nobly marching music of ""Onward, Christian Soldiers. They passed without laughter.",1
1661,"There was a pause. Well, thank God for that! said Ralph Rolls coarsely in a solemn quiet. The Bard's strewn host laughed, rustled noisily into line.",1
1662,"Sh-h!  Sh-h!"" hissed Miss Ida Nelson. What the hell does she think she is?"" said Julius Arthur, ""a steam valve?""  Eugene looked attentively at the shapely legs of the page, Viola. Wow!"" said Ralph Rolls, with his accustomed audibility. Look who's here!",1
1663,"She looked on them all with a pert impartial smile. But she never told her love. Miss Ida Nelson caught the doctor's stealthy sign. Carefully, in slow twos, she fed them down to him.",1
1664,"The Moor of Venice (Mr. George Graves), turned his broad back upon their jibes, and lurched down with sullen-sheepish grin, unable to conceal the massive embarrassment of his calves. Tell him who you are, Villa,"" said Doc Hines. You look like Jack Johnson. The town, in its first white shirting of Spring, sat on the turfy banks, and looked down gravely upon the bosky little comedy of errors; the encircling mountains, and the gods thereon, looked down upon the slightly larger theatre of the town; and, figuratively, from mountains that looked down on mountains, the last stronghold of philosophy, the author of this chronicle looked down on everything.",1
1665,"Here we go, Hal,"" said Doc Hines, nudging Eugene. Give 'em hell, son,"" said Julius Arthur. You're dressed for the part. He looks it, you mean,"" said Ralph Rolls.",1
1666,"Boy, you'll knock 'em dead,"" he added with an indecent laugh. They descended into the hollow, accompanied by a low but growing titter of amazement from the audience. Before them, the doctor had just disposed of Desdemona, who parted with a graceful obeisance. He was now engaged on Othello, who stood, bullish and shy, till his ordeal should finish. In a moment, he strode away, and the doctor turned to Falstaff, reading the man by his padded belly, briskly, with relief:        ""Now, Tragedy, begone, and to our dell       Bring antic Jollity with cap and bells:",1
1667,"Falstaff, thou prince of jesters, lewd old man       Who surfeited a royal prince with mirth,       And swayed a kingdom with his wanton quips--""   Embarrassed by the growing undertone of laughter, Doc Hines squinted around with a tough grin, gave a comical hitch to his padded figure, and whispered a hoarse aside to Eugene:  ""Hear that, Hal? I'm hell on wheels, ain't I?""  Eugene saw him depart in a green blur, and presently became aware that an unnatural silence had descended upon Doctor George B. Rockham. The Voice of History was, for the moment, mute. Its long jaw, in fact, had fallen ajar.",1
1668,Dr. George B. Rockham looked wildly about him for succor. He rolled his eyes entreatingly upwards at Miss Ida Nelson. She turned her head away.,1
1669,"Who are you? he said hoarsely, holding a hairy hand carefully beside his mouth. Prince Hal,"" said Eugene, likewise hoarsely and behind his hand.",1
1670,"Dr. George B. Rockham staggered a little. Their speech had reached the stalls. But firmly, before the tethered chafing laughter, he began:        ""Friend to the weak and comrade of the wild,       By folly sired to wisdom, dauntless Hal--""   Laughter, laughter unleashed and turbulent, laughter that rose flood by flood upon itself, laughter wild, earth-shaking, thunder- cuffing, drowned Dr. George B. Rockham and all he had to say. Laughter!",1
1671,"Laughter! Laughter! Helen was married in the month of June--a month sacred, it is said, to Hymen, but used so often for nuptials that the god's blessing is probably not infallible.",1
1672,"She had returned to Altamont in May, from her last singing engagement. She had been in Atlanta for the week of opera, and had come back by way of Henderson, where she had visited Daisy and Mrs. Selborne. There she had found her mate.",1
1673,"He was not a stranger to her. She had known him years before in Altamont, where he had lived for a short time as district agent for the great and humane corporation that employed him--the Federal Cash Register Company. Since that time he had gone to various parts of the country at his master's bidding, carrying with him his great message of prosperity and thrift. At the present time, he lived with his sister and his aged mother, whose ponderous infirmity of limb had not impaired her appetite, in a South Carolina town. He was devoted and generous to them both. And the Federal Cash Register Company, touched by his devotion to duty, rewarded him with a good salary. His name was Barton. The Bartons lived well.",1
1674,"Helen returned with the unexpectedness in which all returning Gants delighted. She came in on members of her family, one afternoon, in the kitchen at Dixieland. Hello, everybody! she said.",1
1675,"Well, for G-g-god's sake,"" said Luke after a moment. Look who's here! They embraced heartily,  ""Why, what on earth!",1
1676,"cried Eliza, putting her iron down on the board, and wavering on her feet, in an effort to walk in two directions at once. They kissed. I was just thinking to myself,"" said Eliza, more calmly, ""that it wouldn't surprise me a bit if you should come walking in. I had a premonition, I don't know what else you'd call it--""  ""Oh, my God!",1
1677,"groaned the girl, good-humoredly, but with a shade of annoyance. Don't start that Pentland spooky stuff! It makes my flesh crawl. She exchanged a glance of burlesque entreaty with Luke.",1
1678,"Winking, he turned suddenly, and with an idiotic laugh, tickled Eliza sharply. Get away! she shrieked.",1
1679,"He chortled madly. I'll declare, boy! she said fretfully. I believe you're crazy. I'll vow I do!",1
1680,"Helen laughed huskily. Well,"" said Eliza, ""how'd you leave Daisy and the children? They're all right, I suppose,"" said Helen wearily.",1
1681,"Oh, my God! Deliver me! she laughed. You never saw such pests! I spent fifty dollars on them in toys and presents alone! You'd never think it from the thanks I get. Daisy takes it all as her due! Selfish! Selfish! Selfish!""  ""For G-g-god's sake!"" said Luke loyally.",1
1682,"She was one fine girl. I paid for everything I got at Daisy's, I can assure you! she said, sharply, challengingly. I spent no more time there than I had to. I was at Mrs. Selborne's nearly all the time. I had practically all my meals there. Her need for independence had become greater; her hunger for dependents acute.",1
1683,"Her denial of obligation to others was militant. She gave more than she received. Well, I'm in for it,"" she said presently, trying to mask her strong eagerness.",1
1684,"In for what?"" asked Luke. I've gone and done it at last,"" she said. Mercy!"" shrieked Eliza. You're not married, are you?""  ""Not yet,"" said Helen, ""but I will be soon.",1
1685,"Then she told them about Mr. Hugh T. Barton, the cash register salesman. She spoke loyally and kindly of him, without great love. He's ten years older than I am,"" she said.",1
1686,"Well,"" said Eliza thoughtfully, moulding her lips. They sometimes make the best husbands. After a moment, she asked: ""Has he got any property?""  ""No,"" said Helen, ""they live up all he makes.",1
1687,"They live in style, I tell you. There are two servants in that house all the time. The old lady doesn't turn her hand over. Where are you going to live?"" said Eliza sharply.",1
1688,"With his folks?""  ""Well, I should say not! I should say not! said Helen slowly and emphatically. Good heavens, mama! she continued irritably. I want a home of my own. Can't you realize that? I've been doing for others all my life. Now I'm going to let them do for me. I want no in-laws about. No, sir! she said emphatically.",1
1689,"Luke bit his nails nervously. Well, he's g-g-getting a great g-g-girl,"" he said. I hope he has sense enough to realize that. Moved, she laughed bigly, ironically.",1
1690,"I've got one booster, haven't I? she said. She looked at him seriously with clear affectionate eyes. Well, thanks, Luke. You're one of the lot that's always had the interests of the family at heart. Her big face was for a moment tranquil and eager.",1
1691,A great calm lay there: the radiant decent beauty of dawn and rainwater. Her eyes were as luminous and believing as a child's. No evil dwelt in her. She had learned nothing.,1
1692,"Have you told your papa?"" said Eliza, presently. No,"" she said, after a pause, ""I haven't. They thought of Gant in silence, with wonder.",1
1693,"Her going was a marvel. I have a right to my own life,"" said Helen angrily, as if some one disputed that right, ""as much as any one. Good heavens, mama! You and papa have lived your lives--don't you know that? Do you think it's right that I should go on forever looking after him? Do you?"" Her voice rose under the stress of hysteria.",1
1694,"Why, no-o.  I never said--"" Eliza began, flustered and conciliatory. You've spent your life f-f-finking of others and not of yourself,"" said Luke. That's the trouble. They don't appreciate it. Well, I'm not going to any longer.",1
1695,"That's one thing sure! No, indeed! I want a home and some children. I'm going to have them! she said defiantly. In a moment, she added tenderly:  ""Poor old papa!",1
1696,"I wonder what he's going to say?""  He said very little. The Gants, after initial surprise, moulded new events very quickly into the texture of their lives. Abysmal change widened their souls out in a brooding unconsciousness.",1
1697,"Mr. Hugh Barton came up into the hills to visit his affianced kin. He came, to their huge delight, lounging in the long racing chassis of a dusty brown 1911 Buick roadster. He came, in a gaseous coil, to the roaring explosion of great engines. He descended, a tall, elegant figure, dyspeptic, lean almost to emaciation, very foppishly laundered and tailored. He looked the car over slowly, critically, a long cigar clamped in the corner of his saturnine mouth, drawing his gauntlets off deliberately. Then, in the same unhurried fashion, he removed from his head the ten-gallon gray sombrero--the only astonishing feature of his otherwise undebatable costume--and shook each long thin leg delicately for a moment to straighten out the wrinkles. But there were none. Then, deliberately, he came up the walk to Dixieland, where the Gants were assembled. As he came, unhurried, he took the cigar from his mouth calmly and held it in the fingers of his lean, hairy, violently palsied hand. His thin black hair, fine spun, was fanned lightly from its elegance by a wantoning breeze. He espied his betrothed and grinned, with dignity, sardonically, with big nuggets of gold teeth. They greeted and kissed.",1
1698,"This is my mother, Hugh,"" said Helen. Hugh Barton bent slowly, courteously, from his thin waist. He fastened on Eliza a keen penetrating stare that discomposed her. His lips twisted again in an impressive sardonic smile. Every one felt he was going to say something very, very important.",1
1699,"How do you do? he asked, and took her hand. Every one then felt that Hugh Barton had said something very, very important.",1
1700,"With equal slow gravity he greeted each one. They were somewhat awed by his lordliness. Luke, however, burst out uncontrollably:  ""You're g-g-getting a fine girl, Mr. B-b-barton.",1
1701,"Hugh Barton turned on him slowly and fixed him with his keen stare. I think so,"" he said gravely. His voice was deep, deliberate, with an impressive rasp. He was selling himself.",1
1702,"In an awkward silence he turned, grinning amiably, on Eugene.  ""Have a cigar?"" he asked, taking three long powerful weeds from his upper vest pocket, and holding them out in his clean twitching fingers. Thanks,"" said Eugene with a dissipated leer, ""I'll smoke a Camel. He took a package of cigarettes from his pocket.",1
1703,"Gravely, Hugh Barton held a match for him. Why do you wear the big hat?"" asked Eugene. Psychology,"" he said. It makes 'em talk. I tell you what!"" said Eliza, beginning to laugh.",1
1704,"That's pretty smart, isn't it?""  ""Sure!"" said Luke. That's advertising! It pays to advertise!""  ""Yes,"" said Mr. Barton slowly, ""you've got to get the other fellow's psychology.",1
1705,The phrase seemed to describe an action of modified assault and restrained pillage. They liked him very much. They all went into the house.,1
1706,"Hugh Barton's mother was in her seventy-fourth year, but she had the strength of a healthy woman of fifty, and the appetite of two of forty. She was a powerful old lady, six feet tall, with the big bones of a man, and a heavy full-jawed face, sensuous and complacent, and excellently equipped with a champing mill of strong yellow horse-teeth. It was cake and pudding to see her at work on corn on the cob. A slight paralysis had slowed her tongue and thickened her speech a little, so that she spoke deliberately, with a ponderous enunciation of each word. This deformity, which she carefully hid, added to, rather than subtracted from, the pontifical weight of her opinions: she was an earnest Republican-- in memory of her departed mate--and she took a violent dislike to any one who opposed her political judgment. When thwarted or annoyed in any way, the heavy benevolence of her face was dislodged by a thunder-cloud of petulance, and her wide pouting underlip rolled out like a window-shade. But, as she barged slowly along, one big hand gripping a heavy stick on which she leaned her massive weight, she was an impressive dowager.",1
1707,"She's a lady--a real lady,"" said Helen proudly. Any one can see that! She goes out with all the best people. Hugh Barton's sister, Mrs. Genevieve Watson, was a sallow woman of thirty-eight years, tall, wren-like and emaciated, like her brother; dyspeptic, and very elegantly kept.",1
1708,"The divorced Watson was conspicuous for his absence from all conversations: there was once or twice a heavy flutter around his name, a funereal hush, and a muttered suggestion of oriental debauchery. He was a beast,"" said Hugh Barton, ""a low dog. He treated sister very badly. Mrs. Barton wagged her great head with the slow but emphatic approval she accorded all her son's opinions.",1
1709,"O-o-h! she said. He was a ter-rib-bul man. He had, they inferred, been given to hellish practices.",1
1710,"He had ""gone after other women. Sister Veve had a narrow discontented face, a metallic vivacity, an effusive cordiality. She was always very smartly dressed. She had somewhat vague connections in the real estate business; she spoke grandly of obscure affairs; she was always on the verge of an indefinite ""Big Deal. I'm getting them lined up, brother,"" she would say with cheerful confidence.",1
1711,"Things are coming my way. J. D. came in to-day and said:  'Veve--you're the only woman in the world that can put this thing across. Go to it, little girl. There's a fortune in it for you.' And so on.",1
1712,"Her conversation, Eugene thought, was not unlike Brother Steve's. But their affection and loyalty for one another was beautiful. Its unaccustomed faith, its abiding tranquillity, puzzled and disturbed the Gants. They were touched indefinably, a little annoyed, because of it.",1
1713,"The Bartons came to Woodson Street two weeks before the wedding. Within three days after their arrival, Helen and old lady Barton were at odds. It was inevitable. The heat of the girl's first affection for Barton's family wore off very quickly: her possessive instinct asserted itself--she would halve no one's love, she would share with no other a place in the heart. She would own, she would possess completely. She would be generous, but she would be mistress. She would give. It was the law of her nature.",1
1714,"She began immediately, by force of this essential stress, to make out a case against the old woman. Mrs. Barton, too, felt the extent of her loss. She wanted to be sure that Helen realized the extent of her acquisition of one of the latter-day saints.",1
1715,"Rocking ponderously in the dark on Gant's veranda, the old woman would say:  ""You are get-ting a good boy, Hel-en. She would wag her powerful head from side to side, pugnaciously emphatic. Though I do say it myself, you are get-ting one good boy, Hel-en. A bet-ter boy than Hugh does-ent live. Oh, I don't know!",1
1716,"said Helen, annoyed. I don't think it's such a bad bargain for him either, you know. I think pretty well of myself, too. And she would laugh, huskily, heartily, trying in laughter to conceal her resentment, but visibly, to every eye but Mrs. Barton's, angered.",1
1717,"A moment later, on some pretext, she would be back into the house, where, with a face contorted by her rising hysteria, to Luke, Eugene, or any sympathetic audience, she would burst out: You heard that, didn't you? You heard that? You see what I've got to put up with, don't you? Do you see? Do you blame me for not wanting that damned old woman around? Do you? You see how she wants to run things, don't you? Do you see how she rubs it into me whenever she gets a chance? She can't bear to give him up. Of course not! He's her meal-ticket. They've bled him white. Why, even now, if it came to a question of choosing between us--"" her face worked strongly. She could not continue. In a moment she quieted herself, and said decisively:  ""I suppose you know now why we're going to live away from them. You see, don't you? Do you blame me?""  ""No'm,"" said Eugene, obedient after pumping.",1
1718,"It's a d-d-damn shame!"" said Luke loyally. At this moment Mrs. Barton, kindly but authoritative, called from the veranda:  ""Hel-en! Where are you, Hel-en?""  ""O gotohell.",1
1719,"Gotohell!"" said Helen, in a comic undertone. Yes? What is it? she called out sharply.",1
1720,"You see, don't you? She was married at Dixieland, because she was having a big wedding. She knew a great many people.",1
1721,"As her wedding-day approached, her suppressed hysteria mounted. Her sense of decorum grew militant: she attacked Eliza bitterly for keeping certain dubious people in the house. Mama, in heaven's name! What do you mean by allowing such goings- on right in the face of Hugh and his people? What do you suppose they think of it? Have you no respect for my feelings? Good heavens, are you going to have the house full of chippies on the night of my wedding? Her voice was high and cracked. She almost wept.",1
1722,"Why, child!"" said Eliza, with troubled face. What do you mean? I've never noticed anything. Are you blind!",1
1723,"Every one's talking about it! They're practically living together! This last was a reference to a condition existing between a dissipated and alcoholic young man and a darkly handsome young woman, slightly tubercular.",1
1724,"To Eugene was assigned the task of digging this couple out of their burrow. He waited sternly outside the girl's room, watching the shadow dance at the door crack. At the end of the sixth hour, the besieged surrendered--the man came out. The boy--pallid, but proud of his trust--told the house-defiler that he must go. The young man agreed with cheerful alcoholism. He went at once.",1
1725,"Mrs. Pert was saved in the house-cleaning. After all,"" said Helen, ""what do we know about her? They can say what they like about Fatty. I like her. Fems, flowers, potted plants, presents and guests arriving.",1
1726,"The long nasal drone of the Presbyterian minister. The packed crowd. The triumphant booming of ""The Wedding March. A flashlight:  Hugh Barton and his bride limply astare--frightened; Gant, Ben, Luke, and Eugene, widely, sheepishly agrin; Eliza, high- sorrowful and sad; Mrs. Selborne and a smile of subtle mystery; the pert flower-girls; Pearl Hines' happy laughter.",1
1727,"When it was over, Eliza and her daughter hung in each other's arms, weeping. Eliza repeated over and over, from guest to guest:        ""A son is a son till he gets him a wife,       But a daughter's a daughter all the days of her life. She was comforted.",1
1728,"They escaped at length, wilted, from the thronging press of well- wishing guests. White-faced, scared witless, Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Barton got into a closed car. It was done! They would spend the night at the Battery Hill. Ben had engaged the wedding-suite. To- morrow, a honeymoon to Niagara.",1
1729,"Before they went, the girl kissed Eugene with something of the old affection. I'll see you in the Fall, honey. Come over as soon as you're settled. For Hugh Barton was beginning life with his bride in a new place.",1
1730,"He was going to the capital of the State. And it had already been determined, chiefly by Gant, that Eugene was going to the State University. But Hugh and Helen did not go honeymooning the next morning, as they had planned. During the night, as she lay at Dixieland, old Mrs. Barton was taken with a violent, a retching sickness. For once, her massive digestive mechanism failed to meet the heavy demands she had put upon it during the pre-nuptial banqueting. She came near death.",1
1731,"Hugh and Helen returned abruptly next morning to a scene of dismal tinsellings and jaded lilies. Helen hurled her vitality into the sick woman's care; dominant, furious, all-mastering, she blew back her life into her. Within three days, Mrs. Barton was out of danger; but her complete recovery was slow, ugly, and painful. As the days lengthened out wearily, the girl became more and more bitter over her thwarted honeymoon. Rushing out of the sick-room, she would enter Eliza's kitchen with writhen face, unable to control her anger:  ""That damned old woman!",1
1732,"Sometimes I believe she did it on purpose. My God, am I to get no happiness from life? Will they never leave me alone? Urr-p! Urr-p!""--Her rough bacchic smile played loosely over her large unhappy face. Mama, in God's name where does it all come from?"" she said, grinning tearfully. I do nothing but mop up after her. Will you please tell me how long it's going to last?""  Eliza laughed slyly, passing her finger under her broad nosewing.",1
1733,"Why, child! she said. What in the world! I've never seen the like! She must have saved up for the last six months. Yes, sir!"" said Helen, looking vaguely away, with a profane smile playing across her mouth, ""I'd just like to know where the hell it all comes from.",1
1734,"I've had everything else,"" she said, with a rough angry laugh, ""I'm expecting one of her kidneys at any minute. Whew-w!"" cried Eliza, shaken with laughter. Hel-en!  Oh Hel'en! Mrs. Barton's voice came feebly in to them.",1
1735,"O gotohell!"" said the girl, sotto-voce. Urr-p!  Urr-p! She burst suddenly into tears:  ""Is it going to be like this always! I sometimes believe the judgment of God is against us all. Papa was right. Pshaw!"" said Eliza, wetting her fingers, and threading a needle before the light.",1
1736,"I'd go on and pay no more attention to her. There's nothing wrong with her. It's all imagination! It was Eliza's rooted conviction that most human ills, except her own, were ""all imagination. Hel-en!""  ""All right!",1
1737,"I'm coming! the girl cried cheerfully, turning an angry grin on Eliza as she went. It was funny. It was ugly. It was terrible.",1
1738,"It seemed, in fact, that papa was right, and that the chief celestial Cloud-Pusher, the often hymned, whom our bitter moderns have sometimes called ""the ancient Jester""--had turned his frown upon their fortunes. It began to rain--rain incessant, spouting, torrential rain, fell among the reeking hills, leaving grass and foliage drowned upon the slopes, starting the liquid avalanche of earth upon a settlement, glutting lean rocky mountain-streams to a foaming welter of yellow flood. It mined the yellow banks away with unheard droppings; it caved in hillsides; it drank the steep banked earth away below the rails, leaving them strung to their aerial ties across a gutted canyon.",1
1739,"There was a flood in Altamont. It swept down in a converging width from the hills, filling the little river, and foaming beyond its banks in a wide waste Mississippi. It looted the bottomlands of the river; it floated iron and wooden bridges from their piers as it might float a leaf; it brought ruin to the railway flats and all who dwelt therein.",1
1740,"The town was cut off from every communication with the world. At the end of the third week, as the waters slid back into their channels, Hugh Barton and his bride, crouched grimly in the great pit of the Buick, rode out through flooded roads, crawled desperately over ruined trestles, daring the irresistible wrath of water to achieve their wilted anti-climactic honeymoon. He will go where I send him or not at all,"" Gant spoke his final word, not loudly.",1
1741,"Thus, it was decided that Eugene must go to the State University. Eugene did not want to go to the State University. For two years he had romanced with Margaret Leonard about his future education. It was proposed that, in view of his youth, he should attend Vanderbilt (or Virginia) for two years, go to Harvard for two years more, and then, having arrived by easy stages at Paradise, ""top things off"" with a year or two at Oxford.",1
1742,"Then,"" said John Dorsey Leonard, who talked enchantingly on the subject, between mouthfuls of clabber, ""then, my sonny, a man may begin to say he's really 'cultsherd.' After that, of course,"" he continued with a spacious carelessness, ""he may travel for a year or so. But the Leonards were not yet ready to part with him.",1
1743,"You're too young, boy,"" said Margaret Leonard. Can't you persuade your father to wait another year? You're only a child in years, Eugene. You have all the time in the world. Her eyes darkened as she talked.",1
1744,"Gant would not be persuaded. He's old enough,"" he said. When I was his age I had been earning my living for years. I'm getting old. I won't be here much longer. I want him to begin to make a name for himself before I die. He refused stubbornly to consider any postponement.",1
1745,"In his youngest son he saw the last hope of his name's survival in laurels--in the political laurels he so valued. He wanted his son to be a great and far-seeing statesman and a member of the Republican or Democratic party. His choice of a university was therefore a measure of political expediency, founded upon the judgment of his legal and political friends.",1
1746,"He's ready to go,"" said Gant, ""and he's going to the State University, and nowhere else. He'll be given as good an education there as he can get anywhere. Furthermore, he will make friends there who will stand by him the rest of his life. He turned upon his son a glance of bitter reproach. There are very few boys who have had your chance,"" said he, ""and you ought to be grateful instead of turning up your nose at it. Mark my words, you'll live to see the day when you'll thank me for sending you there. Now, I've given you my last word: you'll go where I send you or you'll go nowhere at all. PART THREE    28   Eugene was not quite sixteen years old when he was sent away to the university.",1
1747,"He was, at the time, over six feet and three inches tall, and weighed perhaps 130 pounds. He had been sick very little in his life, but his rapid growth had eaten sharply at his strength: he was full of a wild energy of mind and body that devoured him and left him exhausted. He tired very quickly.",1
1748,"He was a child when he went away: he was a child who had looked much on pain and evil, and remained a fantasist of the Ideal. Walled up in his great city of visions, his tongue had learned to mock, his lip to sneer, but the harsh rasp of the world had worn no grooving in the secret life. Again and again he had been bogged in the gray slough of factuality. His cruel eyes had missed the meaning of no gesture, his packed and bitter heart had sweltered in him like a hot ingot, but all his hard wisdom melted at the glow of his imagination. He was not a child when he reflected, but when he dreamt, he was; and it was the child and dreamer that governed his belief. He belonged, perhaps, to an older and simpler race of men: he belonged with the Mythmakers. For him, the sun was a lordly lamp to light him on his grand adventuring. He believed in brave heroic lives. He believed in the fine flowers of tenderness and gentleness he had little known. He believed in beauty and in order, and that he would wreak out their mighty forms upon the distressful chaos of his life. He believed in love, and in the goodness and glory of women. He believed in valiance, and he hoped that, like Socrates, he would do nothing mean or common in the hour of danger. He exulted in his youth, and he believed that he could never die.",1
1749,"Four years later, when he was graduated, he had passed his adolescence, the kiss of love and death burned on his lips, and he was still a child. When it was at last plain that Gant's will was on this inflexible, Margaret Leonard had said, quietly: Well, then, go your ways, boy. Go your ways. God bless you. She looked a moment at his long thin figure and turned to John Dorsey Leonard with wet eyes:  ""Do you remember that shaver in knee-pants who came to us four years ago?",1
1750,"Can you believe it?""  John Dorsey Leonard laughed quietly, with weary gentle relaxation. What do you know about it?"" he said. When Margaret turned to him again her voice, low and gentle, was charged with the greatest passion he had ever heard in it.",1
1751,"You are taking a part of our heart with you, boy. Do you know that?""  She took his trembling hand gently between her own lean fingers. He lowered his head and closed his eyelids tightly.",1
1752,"Eugene,"" she continued, ""we could not love you more if you were our own child. We wanted to keep you with us for another year, but since that cannot be, we are sending you out with our hopes pinned to you. Oh, boy, you are fine. There is no atom in you that is not fine. A glory and a chrism of bright genius rest upon you. God bless you: the world is yours. The proud words of love and glory sank like music to his heart, evoking their bright pictures of triumph, and piercing him with the bitter shame of his concealed desires.",1
1753,"Love bade him enter, but his soul drew back, guilty of lust and sin. He tore his hand from her grasp, clinching, with the strangled cry of an animal, his convulsive throat. I can't! he choked. You mustn't think-- He could not go on; his life groped blindly to confessional.",1
1754,"Later, after he left her, her light kiss upon his cheek, the first she had ever given him, burned like a ring of fire. That summer he was closer to Ben than ever before. They occupied the same room at Woodson Street. Luke had returned to the Westinghouse plant at Pittsburgh after Helen's marriage.",1
1755,"Gant still occupied his sitting-room, but the rest of the house he had rented to a sprightly gray-haired widow of forty. She looked after them beautifully, but she served Ben with an especial tenderness. At night, on the cool veranda, Eugene would find them below the ripening clusters, hear the quiet note of his brother's voice, his laugh, see the slow red arc of his cigarette in darkness.",1
1756,"The quiet one was more quiet and morose than he had ever been before: he stalked through the house scowling ferociously. All his conversation with Eliza was short and bitterly scornful; with Gant he spoke hardly at all. They had never talked together. Their eyes never met--a great shame, the shame of father and son, that mystery that goes down beyond motherhood, beyond life, that mysterious shame that seals the lips of all men, and lives in their hearts, had silenced them.",1
1757,"But to Eugene, Ben talked more freely than ever before. As they sat upon their beds at night, reading and smoking before they slept, all of the pain and bitterness of Benjamin Gant's life burst out in violent denunciation. He began to speak with slow sullen difficulty, halting over his words as he did when he read, but speaking more rapidly as his quiet voice became more passionate.",1
1758,"I suppose they've told you how poor they are? he began, tossing his cigarette away. Well,"" said Eugene, ""I've got to go easy. I mustn't waste my money. Ah-h!"" said Ben, making an ugly face.",1
1759,"He laughed silently, with a thin and bitter contortion of his lips. Papa said that a lot of boys pay their own way through college by waiting on tables and so on. Perhaps I can do something like that. Ben turned over on his side until he faced his brother, propping himself on his thin hairy forearm.",1
1760,"Now listen, 'Gene,"" he said sternly, ""don't be a damned little fool, do you hear? You take every damn cent you can get out of them,"" he added savagely. Well, I appreciate what they're doing. I'm getting a lot more than the rest of you had. They're doing a lot for me,"" said the boy.",1
1761,"For YOU, you little idiot!"" said Ben, scowling at him in disgust. They're doing it all for themselves. Don't let them get away with that. They think you'll make good and bring a lot of credit to them some day. They're rushing you into it two years too soon, as it is. No, you take everything you can get. The rest of us never had anything, but I want to see you get all that's coming to you. My God! he cried furiously.",1
1762,"Their money's doing no one any good rotting in the damned bank, is it? No, 'Gene, get all you can. When you get down there, if you find you need more to hold your own with the other boys, make the old man give it to you. You've never had a chance to hold your head up in your own home town, so make the most of your chances when you get away. He lighted a cigarette and smoked in bitter silence for a moment.",1
1763,To hell with it all! he said. What in God's name are we living for!,1
1764,"Eugene's first year at the university was filled for him with loneliness, pain, and failure. Within three weeks of his matriculation, he had been made the dupe of a half-dozen classic jokes, his ignorance of all campus tradition had been exploited, his gullibility was a byword. He was the greenest of all green Freshmen, past and present: he had listened attentively to a sermon in chapel by a sophomore with false whiskers; he had prepared studiously for an examination on the contents of the college catalogue; and he had been guilty of the inexcusable blunder of making a speech of acceptance on his election, with fifty others, to the literary society.",1
1765,"And these buffooneries--a little cruel, but only with the cruelty of vacant laughter, and a part of the schedule of rough humor in an American college--salty, extravagant, and national--opened deep wounds in him, which his companions hardly suspected. He was conspicuous at once not only because of his blunders, but also because of his young wild child's face, and his great raw length of body, with the bounding scissor legs. The undergraduates passed him in grinning clusters: he saluted them obediently, but with a sick heart. And the smug smiling faces of his own classmen, the wiser Freshmen, complacently guiltless of his own mistakes, touched him at moments with insane fury.",1
1766,"Smile and smile and s-mile--damn you! he cursed through his grating teeth. For the first time in his life he began to dislike whatever fits too snugly in a measure. He began to dislike and envy the inconspicuous mould of general nature--the multitudinous arms, legs, hands, feet, and figures that are comfortably shaped for ready-made garments. And the prettily regular, wherever he found it, he hated--the vacantly handsome young men, with shining hair, evenly parted in the middle, with sure strong middling limbs meant to go gracefully on dancefloors. He longed to see them commit some awkward blunder--to trip and sprawl, to be flatulent, to lose a strategic button in mixed company, to be unconscious of a hanging shirt-tail while with a pretty girl. But they made no mistakes.",1
1767,"As he walked across the campus, he heard his name called mockingly from a dozen of the impartial windows, he heard the hidden laughter, and he ground his teeth. And at night, he stiffened with shame in his dark bed, ripping the sheet between his fingers as, with the unbalanced vision, the swollen egotism of the introvert, the picture of a crowded student-room, filled with the grinning historians of his exploits, burned in his brain. He strangled his fierce cry with a taloned hand. He wanted to blot out the shameful moment, unweave the loom. It seemed to him that his ruin was final, that he had stamped the beginning of his university life with folly that would never be forgotten, and that the best he could do would be to seek out obscurity for the next four years. He saw himself in his clown's trappings and thought of his former vision of success and honor with a lacerating self-contempt.",1
1768,"There was no one to whom he could turn: he had no friends. His conception of university life was a romantic blur, evoked from his reading and tempered with memories of Stover at Yale, Young Fred Fearnot, and jolly youths with affectionate linked arms, bawling out a cheer-song. No one had given him even the rudimentary data of the somewhat rudimentary life of an American university. He had not been warned of the general taboos. Thus, he had come greenly on his new life, unprepared, as he came ever thereafter on all new life, save for his opium visions of himself a stranger in Arcadias.",1
1769,"He was alone. He was desperately lonely. But the university was a charming, an unforgettable place. It was situated in the little village of Pulpit Hill, in the central midland of the big State. Students came and departed by motor from the dreary tobacco town of Exeter, twelve miles away: the countryside was raw, powerful and ugly, a rolling land of field, wood, and hollow; but the university itself was buried in a pastoral wilderness, on a long tabling butte, which rose steeply above the country. One burst suddenly, at the hill-top, on the end of the straggling village street, flanked by faculty houses, and winding a mile in to the town centre and the university. The central campus sloped back and up over a broad area of rich turf, groved with magnificent ancient trees. A quadrangle of post- Revolutionary buildings of weathered brick bounded the upper end: other newer buildings, in the modern bad manner (the Pedagogic Neo- Greeky), were scattered around beyond the central design: beyond, there was a thickly forested wilderness. There was still a good flavor of the wilderness about the place--one felt its remoteness, its isolated charm. It seemed to Eugene like a provincial outpost of great Rome: the wilderness crept up to it like a beast.",1
1770,"Its great poverty, its century-long struggle in the forest, had given the university a sweetness and a beauty it was later to forfeit. It had the fine authority of provincialism--the provincialism of an older South. Nothing mattered but the State: the State was a mighty empire, a rich kingdom--there was, beyond, a remote and semi-barbaric world.",1
1771,"Few of the university's sons had been distinguished in the nation's life--there had been an obscure President of the United States, and a few Cabinet members, but few had sought such distinction: it was glory enough to be a great man in one's State. Nothing beyond mattered very much. In this pastoral setting a young man was enabled to loaf comfortably and delightfully through four luxurious and indolent years. There was, God knows, seclusion enough for monastic scholarship, but the rare romantic quality of the atmosphere, the prodigal opulence of Springtime, thick with flowers and drenched in a fragrant warmth of green shimmering light, quenched pretty thoroughly any incipient rash of bookishness. Instead, they loafed and invited their souls or, with great energy and enthusiasm, promoted the affairs of glee-clubs, athletic teams, class politics, fraternities, debating societies, and dramatic clubs. And they talked--always they talked, under the trees, against the ivied walls, assembled in their rooms, they talked--in limp sprawls-- incessant, charming, empty Southern talk; they talked with a large easy fluency about God, the Devil, and philosophy, the girls, politics, athletics, fraternities and the girls--My God! how they talked!",1
1772,"Observe,"" lisped Mr. Torrington, the old Rhodes Scholar (Pulpit Hill and Merton, '14), ""observe how skilfully he holds suspense until the very end. Observe with what consummate art he builds up to his climax, keeping his meaning hidden until the very last word. Further, in fact.",1
1773,"At last, thought Eugene, I am getting an education. This must be good writing, because it seems so very dull. When it hurts, the dentist says, it does you good. Democracy must be real, because it is so very earnest. It must be a certainty, because it is so elegantly embalmed in this marble mausoleum of language. Essays For College Men--Woodrow Wilson, Lord Bryce and Dean Briggs.",1
1774,"But there was no word here of the loud raucous voice of America, political conventions and the Big Brass Band, Tweed, Tammany, the Big Stick, lynching bees and black barbecue parties, the Boston Irish, and the damnable machinations of the Pope as exposed by the Babylon Hollow Trumpet (Dem.), the rape of the Belgian virgins, rum, oil, Wall Street and Mexico. All that, Mr. Torrington would have said, was temporary and accidental. It was unsound.",1
1775,"Mr. Torrington smiled moistly at Eugene and urged him tenderly into a chair drawn intimately to his desk.  ""Mr.--? Mr.--?--"" he said, fumbling at his index cards. Gant,"" said Eugene.",1
1776,"Ah, yes--Mr. Gant,"" he smiled his contrition. Now--about your outside reading?"" he began. But what, thought Eugene, about my inside reading?  Did he like to read?",1
1777,"Ah--that was good. He was so glad to hear it. The true university in these days, said Carlyle (he did hope Eugene liked rugged old Thomas), was a collection of books.",1
1778,"Yes, sir,"" said Eugene. That, it seemed to him, was the Oxford Plan. Oh, yes--he had been there, three years, in fact. His mild eye kindled. To loaf along the High on a warm Spring day, stopping to examine in the bookseller's windows the treasures that might be had for so little. Then to Buol's or to a friend's room for tea, or for a walk in the meadows or Magdalen gardens, or to look down into the quad, at the gay pageant of youth below. Ah--Ah! A great place? Well--he'd hardly say that. It all depended what one meant by a great place. Half the looseness in thought--unfortunately, he fancied, more prevalent among American than among English youth--came from an indefinite exuberance of ill-defined speech.",1
1779,"Yes, sir,"" said Eugene. A great place? Well, he'd scarcely say that. The expression was typically American. Butter-lipped, he turned on the boy a smile of soft unfriendliness:  ""It kills,"" he observed, ""a man's useless enthusiasms.",1
1780,"Eugene whitened a little. That's fine,"" he said. Now--let him see. Did he like plays--the modern drama? Excellent. They were doing some very interesting things in the modern drama. Barrie--oh, a charming fellow! What was that? Shaw!",1
1781,"Yes, sir,"" said Eugene. I've read all the others. There's a new book out. Oh, but really!",1
1782,"My dear boy!"" said Mr. Torrington with gentle amazement. He shrugged his shoulders and became politely indifferent. Very well, if he liked. Of course, he thought it rather a pity to waste one's time so when they were really doing some first-rate things. That was JUST the trouble, however. The appeal of a man like that was mainly to the unformed taste, the uncritical judgment. He had a flashy attraction for the immature. Oh, yes! Undoubtedly an amusing fellow. Clever--yes, but hardly significant. And--didn't he think--a trifle noisy? Or had he noticed that? Yes--there was to be sure an amusing Celtic strain, not without charm, but unsound. He was not in line with the best modern thought.",1
1783,"I'll take the Barrie,"" said Eugene. Yes, he rather thought that would be better. Well, good day. Mr.--Mr.--?--?"" he smiled, fumbling again with his cards.",1
1784,"Gant. Oh yes, to be sure,--Gant. He held out his plump limp hand. He did hope Mr. Gant would call on him. Perhaps he'd be able to advise him on some of the little problems that, he knew, were constantly cropping up during the first year. Above all, he mustn't get discouraged.",1
1785,"Yes, sir,"" said Eugene, backing feverishly to the door. When he felt the open space behind him, he fell through it, and vanished. Anyway, he thought grimly, I've read all the damned Barries. I'll write the damned report for him, and damned well read what I damn well please.",1
1786,"God save our King and Queen! He had courses besides in Chemistry, Mathematics, Greek, and Latin. He worked hard and with interest at his Latin. His instructor was a tall shaven man, with a yellow saturnine face. He parted his scant hair cleverly in such a way as to suggest horns. His lips were always twisted in a satanic smile, his eyes gleamed sideward with heavy malicious humor. Eugene had great hopes of him. When the boy arrived, panting and breakfastless, a moment after the class had settled to order, the satanic professor would greet him with elaborate irony: Ah there, Brother Gant! Just in time for church again. Have you slept well? The class roared its appreciation of these subtleties.",1
1787,"And later, in an expectant pause, he would deepen his arched brows portentously, stare up mockingly under his bushy eyebrows at his expectant audience, and say, in a deep sardonic voice: And now, I am going to request Brother Gant to favor us with one of his polished and scholarly translations. These heavy jibes were hard to bear because, of all the class, two dozen or more, Brother Gant was the only one to prepare his work without the aid of a printed translation.",1
1788,"He worked hard on Livy and Tacitus, going over the lesson several times until he had dug out a smooth and competent reading of his own. This he was stupid enough to deliver in downright fashion, without hesitation, or a skilfully affected doubt here and there. For his pains and honesty he was handsomely rewarded by the Amateur Diabolist. The lean smile would deepen as the boy read, the man would lift his eyes significantly to the grinning class, and when it was over, he would say:  ""Bravo, Brother Gant!  Excellent!",1
1789,"Splendid! You are riding a good pony--but a little too smoothly, my boy. You ride a little too well. The class sniggered heavily.",1
1790,"When he could stand it no longer, he sought the man out one day after the class. See here, sir! See here! he began in a voice choking with fury and exasperation. Sir--I assure you--"" he thought of all the grinning apes in the class, palming off profitably their stolen translations, and he could not go on.",1
1791,"The Devil's Disciple was not a bad man; he was only, like most men who pride themselves on their astuteness, a foolish one. Nonsense, Mr. Gant,"" said he kindly. You don't think you can fool me on a translation, do you? It's all right with me, you know,"" he continued, grinning. If you'd rather ride a pony than do your own work, I'll give you a passing grade--so long as you do it well. But--"" Eugene began explosively.",1
1792,"But I think it's a pity, Mr. Gant,"" said the professor, gravely, ""that you're willing to slide along this way. See here, my boy, you're capable of doing first-rate work. I can see that. Why don't you make an effort? Why don't you buckle down and really study, after this?""  Eugene stared at the man, with tears of anger in his eyes.",1
1793,"He sputtered but could not speak. But suddenly, as he looked down into the knowing leer, the perfect and preposterous injustice of the thing--like a caricature--overcame him: he burst into an explosive laugh of rage and amusement which the teacher, no doubt, accepted as confession. Well, what do you say?"" he asked. Will you try? All right!",1
1794,Yes! the boy yelled. I'll try it. He bought at once a copy of the translation used by the class.,1
1795,"Thereafter, when he read, faltering prettily here and there over a phrase, until his instructor should come to his aid, the satanic professor listened gravely and attentively, nodding his head in approval from time to time, and saying, with great satisfaction, when he had finished:  ""Good, Mr. Gant. Very good. That shows what a little real work will do.",1
1796,"And privately, he would say:  ""You see the difference, don't you? I knew at once when you stopped using that pony. Your translation is not so smooth, but it's your own now. You're doing good work, my boy, and you're getting something out of it. It's worth it, isn't it?""  ""Yes,"" said Eugene gratefully, ""it certainly is--""  By far the most distinguished of his teachers this first year was Mr. Edward Pettigrew (""Buck"") Benson, the Greek professor.",1
1797,"Buck Benson was a little man in the middle-forties, a bachelor, somewhat dandified, but old-fashioned, in his dress. He wore wing collars, large plump cravats, and suede-topped shoes. His hair was thick, heavily grayed, beautifully kept. His face was courteously pugnacious, fierce, with large yellow bulging eyeballs, and several bulldog pleatings around the mouth. It was an altogether handsome ugliness.",1
1798,"His voice was low, lazy, pleasant, with an indolent drawl, but without changing its pace or its inflection he could flay a victim with as cruel a tongue as ever wagged, and in the next moment wipe out hostility, restore affection, heal all wounds by the same agency. His charm was enormous. Among the students he was the subject for comical speculation--in their myths, they made of him a passionate and sophisticated lover, and his midget cycle-car, which bounded like an overgrown toy around the campus, the scene of many romantic seductions.",1
1799,"He was a good Grecian--an elegant indolent scholar. Under his instruction Eugene began to read Homer. The boy knew little grammar--he had learned little at Leonard's--but, since he had had the bad judgment to begin Greek under some one other than Buck Benson, Buck Benson thought he knew even less than he did. He studied desperately, but the bitter dyspeptic gaze of the elegant little man frightened him into halting, timorous, clumsy performances. And as he proceeded, with thumping heart and tremulous voice, Buck Benson's manner would become more and more weary, until finally, dropping his book, he would drawl:  ""Mister Gant, you make me so damned mad I could throw you out the window.",1
1800,"But, on the examination, he gave an excellent performance, and translated from sight beautifully. He was saved. Buck Benson commended his paper publicly with lazy astonishment, and gave him a fair grade. Thereafter, they slipped quickly into an easier relation: by Spring, he was reading Euripides with some confidence.",1
1801,"But that which remained most vividly, later, in the drowning years which cover away so much of beauty, was the vast sea-surge of Homer which beat in his brain, his blood, his pulses, as did the sea- sound in Gant's parlor shells, when first he heard it to the slowly pacing feet and the hexametrical drawl of Buck Benson, the lost last weary son of Hellas. Dwaney de clangay genett, argereoyo beeoyo--above the whistle's shriek, the harsh scream of the wheel, the riveter's tattoo, the vast long music endures, and ever shall. What dissonance can quench it? What jangling violence can disturb or conquer it-- entombed in our flesh when we were young, remembered like ""the apple tree, the singing, and the gold""?    29   Before his first year was ended, the boy had changed his lodging four or five times.",1
1802,"He finished the year living alone in a big bare carpetless room--an existence rare at Pulpit Hill, where the students, with very few exceptions, lived two or three to a room. In that room began a physical isolation, hard enough to bear at first, which later became indispensable to him, mind and body. He had come to Pulpit Hill with Hugh Barton, who met him at Exeter and drove him over in the big roadster. After his registration, he had secured lodging quickly at the house of an Altamont widow whose son was a student. Hugh Barton looked relieved and departed, hoping to reach home and his bride by nightfall.",1
1803,"With fine enthusiasm, but poor judgment, Eugene paid the widow two months in advance. Her name was Bradley: she was a flabby petulant woman with a white face and heart-disease. But her food was excellent. Mrs. Bradley's student son answered to his initial letters--""G. T.""  G. T. Bradley, a member of the sophomore class, was a surly scowling youth of nineteen--a mixture, in equal parts, of servility and insolence. His chief, but thwarted, ambition was to be elected to membership in a fraternity. Having failed to win recognition by the exercise of his natural talents, he was driven by an extraordinary obsession that fame and glory would come to him if he were known as the slave-driver of a number of Freshmen.",1
1804,"But these tactics, tried on Eugene, produced at once defiance and resentment. Their hostility was bitter: G. T. set himself to thwart and ruin the beginnings of the boy's university life. He trapped him into public blunders, and solicited audiences to witness his humiliation; he wheedled his confidence and betrayed it. But there is a final mockery, an ultimate treachery that betrays us into shame; our capacity for villainy, like all our other capacities, is so small. The day came when Eugene was free from bondage. He was free to leave the widow's house of sorrow. G. T. approached him, scowling, diffidently.",1
1805,"I hear you're leaving us, 'Gene,"" he said. Yes,"" said Eugene. Is it because of the way I've acted?""  ""Yes,"" said Eugene.",1
1806,"You take things too seriously, 'Gene,"" he said. Yes,"" said Eugene. I don't want you to go having hard feelings, 'Gene. Let's shake hands and be friends. He thrust his hand out stiffly.",1
1807,"Eugene looked at the hard weak face, the furtive, unhappy eyes casting about for something they might call their own. The thick black hair was plastered stiff with grease; he saw white points of dandruff at the roots. There was an odor of talcum powder. He had been borne and nourished in the body of his white-faced mother--for what? To lap the scornful stroking fingers of position; to fawn miserably before an emblem. Eugene had a moment of nausea.",1
1808,"Let's shake hands, 'Gene,"" said the boy once more, waggling his out-thrust fingers. No,"" said Eugene. You don't hate me, do you? whined G. T.  ""No,"" said Eugene.",1
1809,"He had a moment of pity, of sickness. He forgave because it was necessary to forget. Eugene lived in a small world, but its ruins for him were actual. His misfortunes were trifling, but their effect upon his spirit was deep and calamitous. He withdrew deeply and scornfully into his cell. He was friendless, whipped with scorn and pride. He set his face blindly against all the common united life around him.",1
1810,"It was during this bitter and desperate autumn that Eugene first met Jim Trivett. Jim Trivett, the son of a rich tobacco farmer in the eastern part of the State, was a good tempered young tough of twenty years. He was a strong, rather foul-looking boy, with a coarse protruding mouth, full-meated and slightly ajar, constantly rayed with a faint loose smile and blotted at the comer with a brown smear of tobacco juice. He had bad teeth. His hair was light-brown, dry, and unruly: it stuck out in large untidy mats. He was dressed in the last cheap extreme of the dreadful fashion of the time: skin-tight trousers that ended an inch above his oxford shoes exposing an inch of clocked hose, a bobtailed coat belted in across his kidneys, large striped collars of silk. Under his coat he wore a big sweater with high-school numerals.",1
1811,"Jim Trivett lived with several other students from his community in a lodging-house near Mrs. Bradley's but closer to the west gate of the university. There were four young men banded together for security and companionship in two untidy rooms heated to a baking dryness by small cast-iron stoves. They made constant preparations for study, but they never studied: one would enter sternly, announcing that he had ""a hell of a day tomorrow,"" and begin the most minute preparations for a long contest with his books: he would sharpen his pencils carefully and deliberately, adjust his lamp, replenish the red-hot stove, move his chair, put on an eye- shade, clean his pipe, stuff it carefully with tobacco, light, relight, and empty it, then, with an expression of profound relief, hear a rapping on his door.",1
1812,"Come in the house, Goddamn it! he would roar hospitably. Hello, 'Gene! Pull up a chair, son, and sit down,"" said Tom Grant. He was a thickly built boy, gaudily dressed; he had a low forehead, black hair, and a kind, stupid, indolent temper.",1
1813,"Have you been working?""  ""Hell, yes!"" shouted Jim Trivett. I've been working like a son- of-a-bitch. God!"" said Tom Grant, turning slowly to look at him.",1
1814,"Boy, you're going to choke to death on one of those some day. He shook his head slowly and sadly, then continued with a rough laugh:  ""If old man Trivett knew what you were doing with his money, damn if he wouldn't bust a gut. Gene!"" said Jim Trivett, ""what the hell do you know about this damned English, anyway?""  ""What he doesn't know about it,"" said Tom Grant, ""you could write out on the back of a postage stamp.",1
1815,"Old man Sanford thinks you're hell, 'Gene. I thought you had Torrington,"" said Jim Trivett. No,"" said Eugene, ""I wasn't English enough. Young and crude. I changed, thank God! What is it you want, Jim?"" he asked.",1
1816,"I've got a long paper to write. I don't know what to write about,"" said Jim Trivett. What do you want me to do? Write it for you?""  ""Yes,"" said Jim Trivett.",1
1817,"Write your own damn paper,"" said Eugene with mimic toughness, ""I won't do it for you. I'll help you if I can. When are you going to let Hard Boy take you to Exeter?"" said Tom Grant, winking at Jim Trivett.",1
1818,"Eugene flushed, making a defensive answer. I'm ready to go any time he is,"" he said uneasily. Look here, Legs!"" said Jim Trivett, grinning loosely. Do you really want to go with me or are you just bluffing?""  ""I'll go with you!",1
1819,I've told you I'd go with you! Eugene said angrily. He trembled a little.,1
1820,"Tom Grant grinned slyly at Jim Trivett. It'll make a man of you, 'Gene,"" he said. Boy, it'll sure put hair on your chest. He laughed, not loudly, but uncontrollably, shaking his head as at some secret thought.",1
1821,Jim Trivett's loose smile widened. He spat into the wood-box. Gawd! he said. They'll think Spring is here when they see old Legs. They'll need a stepladder to git at him. Tom Grant was shaken with hard fat laughter.,1
1822,"They sure God will! he said. Well, what about it, 'Gene? Jim Trivett demanded suddenly. Is it a go? Saturday?""  ""Suits me!"" said Eugene.",1
1823,"When he had gone, they grinned thirstily at each other for a moment, the pleased corrupters of chastity. Pshaw!"" said Tom Grant. You oughtn't to do that, Hard Boy. You're leading the boy astray. It's not going to hurt him,"" said Jim Trivett.",1
1824,"It'll be good for him. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, grinning. Wait a minute! whispered Jim Trivett. I think this is the place. They had turned away from the centre of the dreary tobacco town.",1
1825,"For a quarter of an hour they had walked briskly through drab autumnal streets, descending finally a long rutted hill that led them, past a thinning squalor of cheap houses, almost to the outskirts. It was three weeks before Christmas: the foggy air was full of chill menace. There was a brooding quietness, broken by far small sounds. They turned into a sordid little road, unpaved, littered on both sides with negro shacks and the dwellings of poor whites. It was a world of rickets. The road was unlighted. Their feet stirred dryly through fallen leaves.",1
1826,"They paused before a two-storey frame house. A lamp burned dimly behind lowered yellow shades, casting a murky pollen out upon the smoky air. Wait a minute,"" said Jim Trivett, in a low voice, ""I'll find out. They heard scuffling steps through the leaves.",1
1827,"In a moment a negro man prowled up. Hello, John,"" said Jim Trivett, almost inaudibly. Evenin', boss! the negro answered wearily, but in the same tone.",1
1828,"We're looking for Lily Jones' house,"" said Jim Trivett. Is this it?""  ""Yes, suh,"" said the negro, ""dis is it. Eugene leaned against a tree, listening to their quiet conspiratorial talk.",1
1829,"The night, vast and listening, gathered about him its evil attentive consciousness. His lips were cold and trembled. He thrust a cigarette between them and, shivering, turned up the thick collar of his overcoat.",1
1830,"Does Miss Lily know you're comin'? the negro asked. No,"" said Jim Trivett. Do you know her?""  ""Yes, suh,"" said the negro.",1
1831,"I'll go up dar wid yo'. Eugene waited in the shadow of the tree while the two men went up to the house. They avoided the front veranda, and went around to the side. The negro rapped gently at a latticed door. There were always latticed doors. Why?  He waited, saying farewell to himself.",1
1832,"He stood over his life, he felt, with lifted assassin blade. He was mired to his neck, inextricably, in complication. There was no escape.",1
1833,"There had been a faint closed noise from the house: voices and laughter, and the cracked hoarse tone of an old phonograph. The sound stopped quickly as the negro rapped: the shabby house seemed to listen. In a moment, a hinge creaked stealthily: he caught the low startled blur of a woman's voice. Who is it? Who?  In another moment Jim Trivett returned to him, and said quietly:  ""It's all right, 'Gene.",1
1834,"Come on. He slipped a coin into the negro's hand, thanking him. Eugene looked for a moment into the black broad friendliness of the man's face. He had a flash of warmth through his cold limbs. The black bawd had done his work eagerly and kindly: over their bought unlovely loves lay the warm shadow of his affection.",1
1835,"They ascended the path quietly and, mounting two or three steps, went in under the latticed door. A woman stood beside it, holding it open. When they had entered, she closed it securely. Then they crossed the little porch and entered the house.",1
1836,"They found themselves in a little hall which cleft the width of the house. A smoky lamp, wicked low, cast its dim circle into the dark. An uncarpeted stair mounted to the second floor. There were two doors both to left and right, and an accordion hat-rack, on which hung a man's battered felt hat.",1
1837,"Jim Trivett embraced the woman immediately, grinning, and fumbling in her breast. Hello, Lily,"" he said. Gawd! She smiled crudely, and continued to peer at Eugene, curious at what the maw of night had thrown in to her. Then, turning to Jim Trivett with a coarse laugh, she said:  ""Lord a' mercy!",1
1838,"Any woman that gits him will have to cut off some of them legs. I'd like to see him with Thelma,"" said Jim Trivett, grinning. Lily Jones laughed hoarsely. The door to the right opened and Thelma, a small woman, slightly built, came out, followed by high empty yokel laughter. Jim Trivett embraced her affectionately.",1
1839,"My Gawd!"" said Thelma, in a tinny voice. What've we got here? She thrust out her sharp wrenny face, and studied Eugene insolently.",1
1840,"I brought you a new beau, Thelma,"" said Jim Trivett. Ain't he the lankiest feller you ever seen?"" said Lily Jones impersonally. How tall are you, son? she added, addressing him in a kind drawl.",1
1841,"He winced a little. I don't know,"" he said. I think about six three. He's more than that!"" said Thelma positively.",1
1842,"He's seven foot tall or I'm a liar. He hasn't measured since last week,"" said Jim Trivett. He can't be sure about it. He's young, too,"" said Lily, staring at him intently.",1
1843,"How old are you, son?""  Eugene turned his pallid face away, indefinitely. Why,"" he croaked, ""I'm about--""  ""He's going on eighteen,"" said Jim Trivett loyally. Don't you worry about him. Old Legs knows all the ropes, all right. He's a bearcat. I wouldn't kid you. He's been there. He don't look that old,"" said Lily doubtfully.",1
1844,"I wouldn't call him more'n fifteen, to look at his face. Ain't he got a little face, though? she demanded in a slow puzzled voice.",1
1845,"It's the only one I've got,"" said Eugene angrily. Sorry I can't change it for a larger one. It looks so funny stickin' way up there above you,"" she went on patiently.",1
1846,"Thelma nudged her sharply. That's because he's got a big frame,"" she said. Legs is all right. When he begins to fill out an' put some meat on them bones he's goin' to make a big man. You'll be a heartbreaker sure, Legs,"" she said harshly, taking his cold hand and squeezing it. In him the ghost, his stranger, turned grievously away. O God! I shall remember, he thought.",1
1847,"Well,"" said Jim Trivett, ""let's git goin'. He embraced Thelma again. They fumbled amorously.",1
1848,"You go on upstairs, son,"" said Lily. I'll be up in a minute. The door's open. See you later, 'Gene,"" said Jim Trivett.",1
1849,"Stay with them, son. He hugged the boy roughly with one arm, and went into the room to the left with Thelma. Eugene mounted the creaking stairs slowly and entered the room with the open door. A hot mass of coals glowed flamelessly in the hearth. He took off his hat and overcoat and threw them across a wooden bed. Then he sat down tensely in a rocker and leaned forward, holding his trembling fingers to the heat. There was no light save that of the coals; but, by their dim steady glow, he could make out the old and ugly wall-paper, stained with long streaks of water rust, and scaling, in dry tattered scrolls, here and there. He sat quietly, bent forward, but he shook violently, as with an ague, from time to time. Why am I here? This is not I, he thought.",1
1850,"Presently he heard the woman's slow heavy tread upon the stairs: she entered in a swimming tide of light, bearing a lamp before her. She put the lamp down on a table and turned the wick. He could see her now more plainly. Lily was a middle-aged country woman, with a broad heavy figure, unhealthily soft. Her smooth peasant face was mapped with fine little traceries of wrinkles at the corners of mouth and eyes, as if she had worked much in the sun. She had black hair, coarse and abundant. She was whitely plastered with talcum powder. She was dressed shapelessly in a fresh loose dress of gingham, unbelted. She was dressed like a housewife, but she conceded to her profession stockings of red silk, and slippers of red felt, trimmed with fur, in which she walked with a flat-footed tread.",1
1851,"The woman fastened the door, and returned to the hearth where the boy was now standing. He embraced her with feverish desire, fondling her with his long nervous hands. Indecisively, he sat in the rocker and drew her down clumsily on his knee. She yielded her kisses with the coy and frigid modesty of the provincial harlot, turning her mouth away. She shivered as his cold hands touched her.",1
1852,"You're cold as ice, son,"" she said. What's the matter? She chafed him with rough embarrassed professionalism.",1
1853,"In a moment she rose impatiently. Let's git started,"" she said. Where's my money?""  He thrust two crumpled bills into her hand.",1
1854,"Then he lay down beside her. He trembled, unnerved and impotent. Passion was extinct in him.",1
1855,"The massed coals caved in the hearth. The lost bright wonder died. When he went down stairs, he found Jim Trivett waiting in the hall, holding Thelma by the hand. Lily led them out quietly, after peering through the lattice into the fog, and listening for a moment.",1
1856,"Be quiet,"" she whispered, ""there's a man across the street. They've been watching us lately. Come again, Slats,"" Thelma murmured, pressing his hand.",1
1857,"They went out softly, treading gently until they reached the road. The fog had thickened: the air was saturated with fine stinging moisture. At the corner, in the glare of the street-lamp, Jim Trivett released his breath with loud relief, and stepped forward boldly.",1
1858,"Damn!"" he said. I thought you were never coming. What were you trying to do with the woman, Legs? Then, noting the boy's face, he added quickly, with warm concern:  ""What's the matter, 'Gene? Don't you feel good?""  ""Wait a minute!"" said Eugene thickly.",1
1859,"Be all right! He went to the curb, and vomited into the gutter. Then he straightened, mopping his mouth with a handkerchief.",1
1860,"How do you feel?"" asked Jim Trivett. Better?""  ""Yes,"" said Eugene, ""I'm all right now. Why didn't you tell me you were sick?"" said Jim Trivett chidingly.",1
1861,"It came on all of a sudden,"" said Eugene. He added presently:  ""I think it was something I ate at that damn Greek's to-night. I felt all right,"" said Jim Trivett.",1
1862,"A cup of coffee will fix you up,"" he added with cheerful conviction. They mounted the hill slowly. The light from winking cornerlamps fell with a livid stare across the fronts of the squalid houses.",1
1863,"Jim,"" said Eugene, after a moment's pause. Yes. What is it?""  ""Don't say anything about my getting sick,"" he said awkwardly.",1
1864,"Surprised, Jim Trivett stared at him. Why not? There's nothing in that,"" he said. Pshaw, boy, any one's likely to get sick. Yes, I know.",1
1865,"But I'd rather you wouldn't. Oh, all right. I won't. Why should I?"" said Jim Trivett.",1
1866,"Eugene was haunted by his own lost ghost: he knew it to be irrecoverable. For three days he avoided every one: the brand of his sin, he felt, was on him. He was published by every gesture, by every word. His manner grew more defiant, his greeting to life more unfriendly. He clung more closely to Jim Trivett, drawing a sad pleasure from his coarse loyal praise. His unappeased desire began to burn anew: it conquered his bodily disgust and made new pictures. At the end of the week he went again, alone, to Exeter, No more of him, he felt, could be lost. This time he sought out Thelma.",1
1867,"When he went home for Christmas, his loins were black with vermin. The great body of the State lay like a barren giant below the leaden reek of the skies. The train roared on across the vast lift of the Piedmont: at night, as he lay in his berth, in a diseased coma, it crawled up into the great fortress of the hills. Dimly, he saw their wintry bulk, with its bleak foresting. Below a trestle, silent as a dream, a white rope of water coiled between its frozen banks. His sick heart lifted in the haunting eternity of the hills. He was hillborn. But at dawn, as he came from the cars with the band of returning students, his depression revived. The huddle of cheap buildings at the station seemed meaner and meaner than ever before. The hills, above the station flats, with their cheap propped houses, had the unnatural closeness of a vision. The silent Square seemed to have rushed together during his absence, and as he left the car and descended the street to Dixieland, it was as if he devoured toy-town distances with a giant's stride.",1
1868,The Christmas was gray and chill. Helen was not there to give it warmth. Gant and Eliza felt the depression of her absence. Ben came and went like a ghost. Luke was not coming home. And he himself was sick with shame and loss.,1
1869,"He did not know where to turn. He paced his chill room at night, muttering, until Eliza's troubled face appeared above her wrapper. His father was gentler, older than he had ever seen him; his pain had returned on him. He was absent and sorrowful. He talked perfunctorily with his son about college. Speech choked in Eugene's throat. He stammered a few answers and fled from the house and the vacant fear in Gant's eyes. He walked prodigiously, day and night, in an effort to command his own fear. He believed himself to be rotting with a leprosy. And there was nothing to do but rot. There was no cure. For such had been the instruction of the moralists of his youth.",1
1870,"He walked with aimless desperation, unable to quiet for a moment his restless limbs. He went up on the eastern hills that rose behind Niggertown. A winter's sun labored through the mist. Low on the meadows, and high on the hills, the sunlight lay on the earth like milk.",1
1871,"He stood looking. A shaft of hope cut through the blackness of his spirit. I will go to my brother, he thought.",1
1872,"He found Ben still in bed at Woodson Street, smoking. He closed the door, then spun wildly about as if caged. In God's name! Ben cried angrily. Have you gone crazy? What's wrong with you?""  ""I'm--I'm sick!",1
1873,"he gasped. What's the matter? Where've you been?"" asked Ben sharply. He sat up in bed.",1
1874,"I've been with a woman,"" said Eugene. Sit down, 'Gene,"" said Ben quietly, after a moment. Don't be a little idiot. You're not going to die, you know. When did this happen?""  The boy blurted out his confession.",1
1875,"Ben got up and put on his clothes. Come on,"" said he, ""we'll go to see McGuire. As they walked townward, he tried to talk, explaining himself in babbling incoherent spurts.",1
1876,"It was like this,"" he began, ""if I had known, but at that time I didn't--of course I know it was my own fault for--""  ""Oh, for God's sake!"" said Ben impatiently. Dry up! I don't want to hear about it. I'm not your damned Guardian Angel. The news was comforting.",1
1877,"So many people, after our fall from grace, are. They mounted to the wide dark corridor of the Doctors' and Surgeons', with its sharp excitement of medical smells. McGuire's anteroom was empty. Ben rapped at the inner door. McGuire opened it: he pulled away the wet cigarette that was plastered on his heavy lip, to greet them.",1
1878,"Hello, Ben.  Hello, son! he barked, seeing Eugene. When'd you get back?""  ""He thinks he's dying of galloping consumption, McGuire,"" said Ben, with a jerk of the head.",1
1879,"You may be able to do something to prolong his life. What's the matter, son?"" said McGuire. Eugene gulped dryly, craning his livid face.",1
1880,"If you don't mind,"" he croaked. See you alone. He turned desperately upon his brother. You stay here. Don't want you with me. I don't want to go with you,"" said Ben surlily.",1
1881,"I've got troubles enough of my own. Eugene followed McGuire's burly figure into the office; McGuire closed the door, and sat down heavily at his littered desk. Sit down, son,"" he commanded, ""and tell me about it. He lit a cigarette and stuck it deftly on his sag wet lip. He glanced keenly at the boy, noting his contorted face.",1
1882,"Take your time, son,"" he said kindly, ""and control yourself. Whatever it is, it's probably not as bad as you think. It was this way,"" Eugene began in a low voice.",1
1883,"I've made a mistake. I know that. I'm willing to take my medicine. I'm not making any excuses for what has happened,"" his voice rose sharply; he got half-way out of his chair, and began to pound fiercely upon the untidy desk. I'm putting the blame on no one. Do you understand that?""  McGuire turned a bloated bewildered face slowly upon his patient.",1
1884,"His wet cigarette sagged comically from his half-opened mouth. Do I understand what?"" he said. See here, 'Gene: what the hell are you driving at? I'm no Sherlock Holmes, you know. I'm your doctor. Spit it out. What I've done,"" he said dramatically, ""thousands have done.",1
1885,"Oh, I know they may pretend not to. But they do! You're a doctor--you know that. People high-up in society, too. I'm one of the unlucky ones. I got caught. Why am I any worse than they are? Why--"" he continued rhetorically.",1
1886,"I think I catch your drift,"" said McGuire dryly. Let's have a look, son. Eugene obeyed feverishly, still declaiming.",1
1887,"Why should I bear the stigma for what others get away with? Hypocrites--a crowd of damned, dirty, whining hypocrites, that's what they are. The Double-Standard! Hah! Where's the justice, where's the honor of that? Why should I be blamed for what people in High Society--""  McGuire lifted his big head from its critical stare, and barked comically.",1
1888,"Who's blaming you? You don't think you're the first one who ever had this sort of trouble, do you? There's nothing wrong with you, anyway. Can--can you cure me?",1
1889,"Eugene asked. No.  You're incurable, son!"" said McGuire. He scrawled a few hieroglyphics on a prescription pad. Give this to the druggist,"" he said, ""and be a little more careful hereafter of the company you keep. People in High Society, eh?"" he grinned. So that's where you've been?""  The great weight of blood and tears had lifted completely out of the boy's heart, leaving him dizzily buoyant, wild, half-conscious only of his rushing words.",1
1890,"He opened the door and went into the outer room. Ben got up quickly and nervously. Well,"" he said, ""how much longer has he got to live? Seriously, in a low voice, he added:  ""There's nothing wrong with him, is there?""  ""No,"" said McGuire, ""I think he's a little off his nut.",1
1891,"But, then, you all are. When they came out on the street again, Ben said:  ""Have you had anything to eat?""  ""No,"" said Eugene. When did you eat last? Some time yesterday,"" said Eugene.",1
1892,I don't remember. You damned fool! Ben muttered. Come on--let's eat. The idea became very attractive.,1
1893,"The world was washed pleasantly in the milky winter sunshine. The town, under the stimulus of the holidays and the returning students, had wakened momentarily from its winter torpor: warm brisk currents of life seethed over the pavements. He walked along at Ben's side with a great bounding stride, unable to govern the expanding joy that rose yeastily in him. Finally, as he turned in on the busy avenue, he could restrain himself no longer: he leaped high in the air, with a yelp of ecstasy:  ""Squee-ee!""  ""You little idiot!",1
1894,"Ben cried sharply. Are you crazy!""  He scowled fiercely, then turned to the roaring passersby, with a thin smile. Hang on to him, Ben!"" yelled Jim Pollock. He was a deadly little man, waxen and smiling under a black mustache, the chief compositor, a Socialist.",1
1895,"If you cut off his damned big feet,"" said Ben, ""he'd go up like a balloon. They went into the big new lunch-room and sat at one of the tables. What's yours?"" said the waiter.",1
1896,"A cup of coffee and a piece of mince pie,"" said Ben. I'll take the same,"" said Eugene. Eat!"" said Ben fiercely. Eat!",1
1897,"Eugene studied the card thoughtfully. Bring me some veal cutlets breaded with tomato sauce,"" he said, ""with a side-order of hash-brown potatoes, a dish of creamed carrots and peas, and a plate of hot biscuits. Also a cup of coffee. Eugene got back his heart again.",1
1898,"He got it back fiercely and carelessly, with an eldritch wildness. During the remainder of his holiday, he plunged recklessly through the lively crowds, looking boldly but without insolence at the women and young girls. They grew unexpectedly out of the waste drear winter like splendid flowers. He was eager and alone. Fear is a dragon that lives among crowds--and in armies. It lives hardly with men who are alone. He felt released--beyond the last hedge of desperation.",1
1899,"Freed and alone, he looked with a boding detachment at all the possessed and possessing world about him. Life hung for his picking fingers like a strange and bitter fruit. THEY--the great clan huddled there behind the stockade for warmth and safety--could hunt him down some day and put him to death: he thought they would.",1
1900,"But he was not now afraid--he was content, if only the struggle might be fruitful. He looked among the crowds printed with the mark of his danger, seeking that which he might desire and take. He went back to the university sealed up against the taunts of the young men: in the hot green Pullman they pressed about him with thronging jibe, but they fell back sharply, as fiercely he met them, with constraint.",1
1901,"There came and sat beside him Tom French, his handsome face vested in the hard insolence of money. He was followed by his court jester, Roy Duncan, the slave with the high hard cackle. Hello, Gant,"" said Tom French harshly. Been to Exeter lately?"" Scowling, he winked at grinning Roy.",1
1902,"Yes,"" said Eugene, ""I've been there lately, and I'm on my way there now. What's it to you, French? Discomfited by this hard defiance, the rich man's son drew back.",1
1903,"We hear you're stepping out among them, 'Gene,"" said Roy Duncan, cackling. Who's we?"" said Eugene. Who's them?""  ""They say,"" said Tom French, ""that you're as pure as the flowing sewer.",1
1904,"If I need cleaning,"" said Eugene, ""I can always use the Gold Dust Twins, can't I?  French and Duncan, the Gold Dust Twins--who never do any work. The cluster of grinning students, the young impartial brutes who had gathered about them on the seats back and front, laughed loudly. That's right! That's right! Talk to them, 'Gene!"" said Zeno Cochran, softly. He was a tall lad of twenty, slender and powerful, with the grace of a running horse. He had punted against the wind for eighty yards in the Yale Bowl. He was a handsome fellow, soft-spoken and kindly, with the fearless gentleness of the athlete.",1
1905,"Confused and angry, with sullen boastfulness, Tom French said:  ""Nobody has anything on me. I've been too slick for them. Nobody knows anything about me. You mean,"" said Eugene, ""that every one knows all about you, and nobody wants to know anything about you.",1
1906,"The crowd laughed. Wow!"" said Jimmy Revell. What about that, Tom?"" he asked challengingly. He was very small and plump, the son of a carpenter, offensively worthy, working his way through college by various schemes. He was a ""kidder,"" an egger-on, finding excuse for his vulgarity and malice in a false and loud good-humor.",1
1907,"Eugene turned quietly on Tom French. Stop it! he said. Don't go on because the others are listening. I don't think it's funny. I don't like it. I don't like you. I want you to leave me alone now. Do you hear? Come on,"" said Roy Duncan, rising, ""leave him alone, Tom.",1
1908,He can't take a joke. He takes things too seriously. They left him.,1
1909,"Unperturbed, relieved, he turned his face toward the vast bleak earth, gray and hoary in the iron grip of winter. Winter ended. The sleety frozen earth began to soften under thaw and the rain. The town and campus paths were dreary trenches of mud and slime. The cold rain fell: the grass shot up in green wet patches. He hurtled down the campus lanes, bounding like a kangaroo, leaping high at the lower boughs to clip a budding twig with his teeth. He cried loudly in his throat--a whinnying squeal-- the centaur-cry of man or beast, trying to unburden its overladen heart in one blast of pain and joy and passion. At other times he slouched by, depressed by an unaccountable burden of weariness and dejection.",1
1910,"He lost count of the hours--he had no sense of time--no regular periods for sleep, work, or recreation, although he attended his classes faithfully, and ate with fair regularity by compulsion of dining-hall or boarding-house schedules. The food was abundant, coarse, greasily and badly cooked. It was very cheap: at the college commons, twelve dollars a month; at the boarding-houses, fifteen. He ate at the commons for a month: his interest in food was too profound and too intelligent to stand it longer. The commons was housed in a large bleak building of white brick. It was called officially Stiggins Hall, but in the more descriptive epithet of the students--The Sty.",1
1911,"He went to see Helen and Hugh Barton several times. They lived thirty-five miles away at Sydney, the State capital. It was a town of thirty thousand people, sleepy, with quiet leafy pavements, and a capitol Square in the centre, with radial streets. At the head of the main street, across from the capitol, a brown weathered building of lichened stone, was a cheap hotel--the largest and most notorious brothel in town. There were also three denominational colleges for young women.",1
1912,"The Bartons had rented quarters in an old house on the street above the Governor's Mansion. They lived in three or four rooms on the ground floor. It was to Sydney that Gant had come, a young man, from Baltimore, on his slow drift to the South. It was in Sydney that he had first started business for himself and conceived, from the loss of his first investments, his hatred of property. It was in Sydney that he had met and wedded the sainted Cynthia, the tubercular spinstress who had died within two years of their marriage.",1
1913,"Their father's great ghost haunted them: it brooded over the town, above the scouring oblivion of the years that wipes all trace of us away. Together, they hunted down into the mean streets, until they stood at length before a dreary shop on the skirts of the negro district. This must be it,"" she said. His shop stood here. It's gone now. She was silent a moment.",1
1914,"Poor old Papa. She turned her wet eyes away. There was no mark of his great hand on this bleak world. No vines grew round the houses. That part of him which had lived here was buried--buried with a dead woman below the long gray tide of the years. They stood quietly, frightened, in that strange place, waiting to hear the summons of his voice, with expectant unbelief, as some one looking for the god in Brooklyn.",1
1915,"In April the nation declared war on Germany. Before the month was out, all the young men at Pulpit Hill who were eligible--those who were twenty-one--were going into service. At the gymnasium he watched the doctors examine them, envying the careless innocence with which they stripped themselves naked. They threw off their clothes in indifferent heaps and stood, laughing and certain, before the doctors. They were clean-limbed, sound and white of tooth, graceful and fast in their movements. The fraternity men joined first--those merry and extravagant snobs of whom he had never known, but who now represented for him the highest reach of urbane and aristocratic life. He had seen them, happy and idle, on the wide verandas of their chapter houses--those temples where the last and awful rites of initiation were administered. He had seen them, always together, and from the herd of the uninitiated always apart, laughing over their mail at the post-office, or gambling for ""black cows,"" at the drug-store. And, with a stab of failure, with regret, with pain at his social deficiency, he had watched their hot campaigns for the favor of some desirable freshman--some one vastly more elegant than himself, some one with blood and with money. They were only the sons of the little rich men, the lords of the village and county, but as he saw them go so surely, with such laughing unconstraint, in well-cut clothes, well-groomed, well-brushed, among the crowd of humbler students, who stiffened awkwardly with peasant hostility and constraint,--they were the flower of chivalry, the sons of the mansion-house. They were Sydney, Raleigh, Nash. And now, like gentlemen, they were going to war.",1
1916,"The gymnasium was thick with the smell of steam and of sweating men coming in to the showers from the playing fields. Washed, with opened shirt, Eugene walked slowly away into the green budding shade of the campus, companioned by an acquaintance, Ralph Hendrix. Look!"" said Ralph Hendrix, in a low angry tone. Look at that, will you! He nodded toward a group of students ahead. That little Horse's Neck is booting the Dekes all over the campus. Eugene looked, then turned to examine the bitter common face beside him.",1
1917,"Every Saturday night, after the meeting of the literary society, Ralph Hendrix went to the drug-store and bought two cheap cigars. He had bent narrow shoulders, a white knobby face, and a low forehead. He spoke in a monotonous painful drawl. His father was foreman in a cotton mill.",1
1918,"They're all Horse's Necks,"" he said. They can go to hell before I'll boot to get in. Yes,"" said Eugene.",1
1919,But he wanted to get in. He wanted to be urbane and careless. He wanted to wear well-cut clothes. He wanted to be a gentleman. He wanted to go to war.,1
1920,"On the central campus, several students who had been approved by the examining board, descended from the old dormitories, bearing packed valises. They turned down under the trees, walking toward the village street. From time to time they threw up an arm in farewell.",1
1921,"So long, boys! See you in Berlin. The shining and dividing sea was closer and not so wide.",1
1922,"He read a great deal--but at random, for pleasure. He read Defoe, Smollet, Stern, and Fielding--the fine salt of the English novel lost, during the reign of the Widow of Windsor, beneath an ocean of tea and molasses. He read the tales of Boccaccio, and all that remained of a tattered copy of the Heptameron. At Buck Benson's suggestion, he read Murray's Euripides (at the time he was reading the Greek text of the Alcestis--noblest and loveliest of all the myths of Love and Death). He saw the grandeur of the Prometheus fable--but the fable moved him more than the play of Æschylus. In fact, Æschylus he found sublime--and dull: he could not understand his great reputation. Rather--he could. He was Literature--a writer of masterpieces. He was almost as great a bore as Cicero-- that windy old moralist who came out so boldly in favor of Old Age and Friendship. Sophocles was an imperial poet--he spoke like God among flashes of lightning: the Œdipus Rex is not only one of the greatest plays in the world, it is one of the greatest stories. This story--perfect, inevitable, and fabulous--wreaked upon him the nightmare coincidence of Destiny. It held him birdlike before its great snake-eye of wisdom and horror. And Euripides (whatever the disparagement of pedantry) he thought one of the greatest lyrical singers in all poetry.",1
1923,"He liked all weird fable and wild invention, in prose or verse, from the Golden Ass to Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the chief prince of the moon and magic. But he liked the fabulous wherever he found it, and for whatever purpose. The best fabulists have often been the greatest satirists: satire (as with Aristophanes, Voltaire, and Swift) is a high and subtle art, quite beyond the barnyard snipings and wholesale geese- slaughterings of the present degenerate age. Great satire needs the sustenance of great fable. Swift's power of invention is incomparable: there's no better fabulist in the world.",1
1924,"He read Poe's stories, Frankenstein, and the plays of Lord Dunsany. He read Sir Gawayne and the Greene Knight and the Book of Tobit. He did not want his ghosts and marvels explained. Magic was magic. He wanted old ghosts--not Indian ghosts, but ghosts in armor, the spirit of old kings, and pillioned ladies with high coned hats. Then, for the first time, he thought of the lonely earth he dwelt on. Suddenly, it was strange to him that he should read Euripides there in the wilderness.",1
1925,"Around him lay the village; beyond, the ugly rolling land, sparse with cheap farmhouses; beyond all this, America--more land, more wooden houses, more towns, hard and raw and ugly. He was reading Euripides, and all around him a world of white and black was eating fried food. He was reading of ancient sorceries and old ghosts, but did an old ghost ever come to haunt this land? The ghost of Hamlet's Father, in Connecticut.        "". . . . . .",1
1926,"I am thy father's spirit,       Doomed for a certain term to walk the night       Between Bloomington and Portland, Maine. He felt suddenly the devastating impermanence of the nation. Only the earth endured--the gigantic American earth, bearing upon its awful breast a world of flimsy rickets. Only the earth endured-- this broad terrific earth that had no ghosts to haunt it. Stogged in the desert, half-broken and overthrown, among the columns of lost temples strewn, there was no ruined image of Menkaura, there was no alabaster head of Akhnaton. Nothing had been done in stone. Only this earth endured, upon whose lonely breast he read Euripides. Within its hills he had been held a prisoner; upon its plain he walked, alone, a stranger.",1
1927,"O God! O God! We have been an exile in another land and a stranger in our own. The mountains were our masters: they went home to our eye and our heart before we came to five. Whatever we can do or say must be forever hillbound. Our senses have been fed by our terrific land; our blood has learned to run to the imperial pulse of America which, leaving, we can never lose and never forget. We walked along a road in Cumberland, and stooped, because the sky hung down so low; and when we ran away from London, we went by little rivers in a land just big enough. And nowhere that we went was far: the earth and the sky were close and near. And the old hunger returned--the terrible and obscure hunger that haunts and hurts Americans, and that makes us exiles at home and strangers wherever we go.",1
1928,"Eliza visited Helen in Sydney in the Spring. The girl was quieter, sadder, more thoughtful than she had ever been. She was subdued by the new life: chastened by her obscurity. She missed Gant more than she would confess. She missed the mountain town.",1
1929,"What do you have to pay for this place?"" said Eliza, looking around critically. Fifty dollars a month,"" said Helen.  ""Furnished?""  ""No, we had to buy furniture. I tell you what, that's pretty high,"" said Eliza, ""just for down stairs.",1
1930,"I believe rents are lower at home. Yes, I know it's high,"" said Helen. But good heavens, mama! Do you realize that this is the best neighborhood in town? We're only two blocks from the Governor's Mansion, you know. Mrs. Mathews is no common boarding-house keeper, I can assure you! No sir! she exclaimed, laughing. She's a real swell--goes to all the big functions and gets in the papers all the time. You know Hugh and I have got to try to keep up appearances. He's a young man just starting out here. Yes.  I know,"" Eliza agreed thoughtfully.",1
1931,"How's he been doing?""  ""O'Toole says he's the best agent he's got,"" said Helen. Hugh's all right. We could get along together anywhere, as long as there's no damned family about. It makes me furious at times to see him slaving to feather O'Toole's pockets. He works like a dog. You know, O'Toole gets a commission on every sale he makes. And Mrs. O'T. and those two girls ride around in a big car and never turn their hands over. They're Catholics, you know, but they get to go everywhere. I tell you what,"" said Eliza with a timid half-serious smile, ""it might not be a bad idea if Hugh became his own boss.",1
1932,"There's no use doing it all for the other fellow. Say, child! she exclaimed, ""why wouldn't it be a good idea if he tried to get the Altamont agency? I don't believe that fellow they've got is much account. He could get it without trying. There was a pause.",1
1933,"We've been thinking of that,"" the girl admitted slowly. Hugh has written in to the main office. Anyway,"" she said a moment later, ""he'd be his own boss. That's something. Well,"" said Eliza slowly, ""I don't know but what it'd be a good idea.",1
1934,"If he works hard there's no reason why he shouldn't build a good business up. Your papa's been complaining here lately about his trouble. He'd be glad to have you back. She shook her head slowly for a moment. Child! they didn't do him a bit of good, up there. It's all come back. They drove over to Pulpit Hill at Easter for a two days' visit.",1
1935,"Eliza took him to Exeter and bought him a suit of clothes. I don't like those skimpy trousers,"" she told the salesman. I want something that makes him look more of a man. When he was newly dressed, she puckered her lips, smiling, and said:  ""Spruce up, boy!  Throw your shoulders back!",1
1936,"That's one thing about your father--he carries himself straight as an arrow. If you go all humped over like that, you'll have lung trouble before you're twenty-five. I want you to meet my mother,"" he said awkwardly to Mr. Joseph Ballantyne, a smooth pink young man who had been elected president of the Freshman class.",1
1937,"You're a good smart-looking fellow,"" said Eliza smiling, ""I'll make a trade with you. If you drum up some boarders for me among your friends here in this part of the State, I'll throw in your board free. Here are some of my cards,"" she added, opening her purse. You might hand a few of them out, if you get a chance, and say a good word for Dixieland in the Land of the Sky.""  ""Yes, ma'am,"" said Mr. Ballantyne, in a slow surprised voice, ""I certainly will.",1
1938,"Eugene turned a hot distressed face toward Helen. She laughed huskily, ironically, then turning to the boy, said:  ""You're welcome at any time, Mr. Ballantyne, boarders or not. We'll always find a place for you. When they were alone, in answer to his stammering and confused protests, she said with an annoyed grin:",1
1939,"Yes, I know. It's pretty bad. But you're away from it most of the time. You're the lucky one. You see what I've had to listen to, the last week, don't you? You see, don't you?""    When he went home at the end of the year, late in May, he found that Helen and Hugh Barton had preceded him.",1
1940,"They were living with Gant, at Woodson Street. Hugh Barton had secured the Altamont agency. The town and the nation boiled with patriotic frenzy--violent, in a chaotic sprawl, to little purpose. The spawn of Attila must be crushed (""exterminated,"" said the Reverend Mr. Smallwood) by the sons of freedom. There were loans, bond issues, speech-making, a talk of drafts, and a thin trickle of Yankees into France. Pershing arrived in Paris, and said, ""Lafayette, we are here! , but the French were still looking. Ben went up before the enlistment board and was rejected. Lungs--weak! they said quite definitely. No--not tubercular. A tendency. Underweight. He cursed. His face was a little more like a blade--thinner, grayer. The cleft of his scowl was deeper. He seemed more alone.",1
1941,Eugene came up into the hills again and found them in their rich young summer glory. Dixieland was partly filled by paying guests. More arrived.,1
1942,"Eugene was sixteen years old. He was a College Man. He walked among the gay crowd of afternoon with a sense of elation, answering the hearty greetings with joy, warming to its thoughtless bombast.",1
1943,"They tell me you're batting a thousand down there, son,"" yelled Mr. Wood, the plump young pharmacist, who had been told nothing at all. That's right, boy! Go get 'em. The man passed forward cheerfully, up the prosperous glade of his store. Fans droned.",1
1944,"After all, Eugene thought, he had not done so badly. He had felt his first wounds. He had not been broken. He had seen love's bitter mystery. He had lived alone.",1
1945,30   There was at Dixieland a girl named Laura James. She was twenty- one years old. She looked younger. She was there when he came back.,1
1946,"Laura was a slender girl, of medium height, but looking taller than she was. She was very firmly moulded: she seemed fresh and washed and clean. She had thick hair, very straight and blonde, combed in a flat bracelet around her small head. Her face was white, with small freckles. Her eyes were soft, candid, cat-green. He nose was a little too large for her face: it was tilted. She was not pretty. She dressed very simply and elegantly in short plaid skirts and waists of knitted silk.",1
1947,"She was the only young person at Dixieland. Eugene spoke to her with timid hauteur. He thought her plain and dull. But he began to sit with her on the porch at night. Somehow, he began to love her.",1
1948,"He did not know that he loved her. He talked to her arrogantly and boastfully as they sat in the wooden porch-swing. But he breathed the clean perfume of her marvellous young body. He was trapped in the tender cruelty of her clear green eyes, caught in the subtle net of her smile.",1
1949,"Laura James lived in the eastern part of the State, far east even of Pulpit Hill, in a little town built on a salt river of the great coastal plain. Her father was a wealthy merchant--a wholesale provisioner. The girl was an only child: she spent extravagantly.",1
1950,"Eugene sat on the porch rail one evening and talked to her. Before, he had only nodded, or spoken stiffly a word or two. They began haltingly, aware painfully of gaps in their conversation.",1
1951,"You're from Little Richmond, aren't you?"" he said. Yes,"" said Laura James, ""do you know any one from there? Yes,"" said he, ""I know John Bynum and a boy named Ficklen.",1
1952,"They're from Little Richmond, aren't they?""  ""Oh, Dave Ficklen! Do you know him? Yes. They both go to Pulpit Hill. Do you go there? Yes,"" he said, ""that's where I knew them.",1
1953,"Do you know the two Barlow boys? They're Sigma Nus,"" said Laura James. He had seen them. They were great swells, football men.",1
1954,"Yes, I know them,"" he said, ""Roy Barlow and Jack Barlow. Do you know 'Snooks' Warren? He's a Kappa Sig. Yes.",1
1955,"They call them Keg Squeezers,"" said Eugene. What fraternity are you?"" said Laura James. I'm not any,"" he said painfully. I was just a Freshman this year. Some of the best friends I have never joined fraternities,"" said Laura James.",1
1956,"They met more and more frequently, without arrangement, until by silent consent they met every night upon the porch. Sometimes they walked along the cool dark streets. Sometimes he squired her clumsily through the town, to the movies, and later, with the uneasy pugnacity of youth, past the loafing cluster at Wood's. Often he took her to Woodson Street, where Helen secured for him the cool privacy of the veranda. She was very fond of Laura James.",1
1957,"She's a nice girl. A lovely girl. I like her. She's not going to take any beauty prizes, is she? She laughed with a trace of good-natured ridicule.",1
1958,"He was displeased. She looks all right,"" he said. She's not as ugly as you make out.",1
1959,"But she WAS ugly--with a clean lovely ugliness. Her face was freckled lightly, over her nose and mouth: her features were eager, unconscious, turned upward in irregular pertness. But she was exquisitely made and exquisitely kept: she had the firm young line of Spring, budding, slender, virginal. She was like something swift, with wings, which hovers in a wood--among the feathery trees suspected, but uncaught, unseen.",1
1960,"He tried to live before her in armor. He showed off before her. Perhaps, he thought, if he were splendid enough, she would not see the ugly disorder and meanness of the world he dwelt in.",1
1961,"Across the street, on the wide lawn of the Brunswick--the big brick gabled house that Eliza once had coveted--Mr. Pratt, who crawled in that mean world in which only a boarding-house husband can exist, was watering wide green spaces of lawn with a hose. The flashing water motes gleamed in the red glare of sunset. The red light fell across the shaven pinched face. It glittered on the buckles of his arm-bands. Across the walk, on the other lobe of grass, several men and women were playing croquet. There was laughter on the vine-hid porch. Next door, at the Belton, the boarders were assembled on the long porch in bright hashhouse chatter. The comedian of the Dixie Ramblers arrived with two chorus girls. He was a little man, with the face of a weasel and no upper teeth. He wore a straw hat with a striped band, and a blue shirt and collar. The boarders gathered in around him. In a moment there was shrill laughter.",1
1962,"Julius Arthur sped swiftly down the hill, driving his father home. He grinned squintily and flung his arm up in careless greeting. The prosperous lawyer twisted a plump Van Dyked face on a wry neck curiously. Unsmiling, he passed.",1
1963,A negress in the Brunswick struck on the several bells of a Japanese gong. There was a scramble of feet on the porch; the croquet players dropped their mallets and walked rapidly toward the house. Pratt wound his hose over a wooden reel.,1
1964,"A slow bell-clapper in the Belton sent the guests in a scrambling drive for the doors. In a moment there was a clatter of heavy plates and a loud foody noise. The guests on the porch at Dixieland rocked more rapidly, with low mutters of discontent.",1
1965,"Eugene talked to Laura in thickening dusk, sheeting his pain in pride and indifference. Eliza's face, a white blur in the dark, came up behind the screen. Come on out, Mrs. Gant, and get a breath of fresh air,"" said Laura James.",1
1966,"Why no-o, child. I can't now. Who's that with you? she cried, obviously flustered. She opened the door. Huh?  Heh?  Have you seen 'Gene? Is it 'Gene?""  ""Yes,"" he said.",1
1967,"What's the matter?""  ""Come here a minute, boy,"" she said. He went into the hall. What is it? he asked.",1
1968,"Why, son, what in the world! I don't know. You'll have to do something,"" she whispered, twisting her hands together.",1
1969,"What is it, mama? What are you talking about?"" he cried irritably. Why--Jannadeau's just called up. Your papa's on a rampage again and he's coming this way. Child! There's no telling what he'll do. I've all these people in the house. He'll ruin us. She wept. Go and try to stop him. Head him off if you can. Take him to Woodson Street. He got his hat quickly and ran through the door.",1
1970,"Where are you going?"" asked Laura James. Are you going off without supper?""  ""I've got to go to town,"" he said. I won't be long. Will you wait for me?""  ""Yes,"" she said.",1
1971,"He leaped down on the walk just as his father lurched in from the street by the high obscuring hedge that shut the house from the spacious yard of the attorney Hall. Gant reeled destructively, across a border of lilies, on to the lawn, and strode for the veranda. He stumbled, cursing, on the bottom step and plunged forward in a sprawl upon the porch. The boy jumped for him, and half dragged, half lifted his great drunken body erect. The boarders shrank into a huddle with a quick scattering of chairs: he greeted them with a laugh of howling contempt.",1
1972,"Are you there? I say, are you there? The lowest of the low-- boarding-house swine! Merciful God! What a travesty! A travesty on Nature! That it should come to this!""  He burst into a long peal of maniacal laughter.",1
1973,"Papa!  Come on!"" said Eugene in a low voice. He took his father cautiously by the sleeve. Gant flung him half across the porch with a gesture of his hand. As he stepped in again swiftly, his father struck at him with a flailing arm. He evaded the great mowing fist without trouble, and caught the falling body, swung from its own pivot, in his arms. Then quickly, before Gant could recover, holding him from behind, he rushed him toward the door. The boarders scattered away like sparrows. But Laura James was at the screen before him: she flung it open.",1
1974,"Get away! Get away! he cried, full of shame and anger. You stay out of this. For a moment he despised her for seeing his hurt.",1
1975,"Oh, let me help you, my dear,"" Laura James whispered. Her eyes were wet, but she was not afraid. Father and son plunged chaotically down the wide dark hall, Eliza, weeping and making gestures, just before them.",1
1976,"Take him in here, boy. Take him in here,"" she whispered, motioning to a large bed-room on the upper side of the house. Eugene propelled his father through a blind passage of bath room, and pushed him over on the creaking width of an iron bed.",1
1977,"You damned scoundrel! Gant yelled, again trying to reap him down with the long arm, ""let me up or I'll kill you!""  ""For God's sake, papa,"" he implored angrily, ""try to quiet down. Every one in town can hear you. To hell with them!",1
1978,"Gant roared. Mountain Grills--all of them, fattening upon my heart's-blood. They have done me to death, as sure as there's a God in heaven. Eliza appeared in the door, her face contorted by weeping.",1
1979,"Son, can't you do something to stop him?"" she said. He'll ruin us all. He'll drive every one away. Gant struggled to stand erect when he saw her.",1
1980,"Her white face stirred him to insanity. There it is! There! There! Do you see! The fiend-face I know so well, gloating upon my misery. Look at it! Look! Do you see its smile of evil cunning? Greeley, Will, The Hog, The Old Major! The Tax Collector will get it all, and I shall die in the gutter!",1
1981,"If it hadn't been for me,"" Eliza began, stung to retaliation, ""you'd have died there long ago. Mama, for God's sake! the boy cried. Don't stand there talking to him! Can't you see what it does to him! Do something, in heaven's name! Get Helen! Where is she?""  ""I'll make an end to it all!",1
1982,"Gant yelled, staggering erect. I'll do for us both now. Eliza vanished.",1
1983,"Yes, sir, papa. It's going to be all right,"" Eugene began soothingly, pushing him back on the bed again. He dropped quickly to his knees, and began to draw off one of Gant's soft tongueless shoes, muttering reassurances all the time: Yes, sir. We'll get you some good hot soup and put you to bed in a jiffy. Everything's going to be all right,"" the shoe came off in his hand and, aided by the furious thrust of his father's foot, he went sprawling back.",1
1984,"Gant got to his feet again and, taking a farewell kick at his fallen son, lunged toward the door. Eugene scrambled up quickly, and leaped after him. The two men fell heavily into the roughly grained plaster of the wall. Gant cursed, flailing about clumsily at his tormentor. Helen came in.",1
1985,"Baby!"" Gant wept, ""they're trying to kill me. O Jesus, do something to save me, or I perish. You get back in that bed,"" she commanded sharply, ""or I'll knock your head off.",1
1986,"Very obediently he suffered himself to be led back to bed and undressed. In a few minutes she was sitting beside him with a bowl of smoking soup. He grinned sheepishly as she spooned it into his opened mouth. She laughed--almost happily--thinking of the lost and irrevocable years. Suddenly, before he slept, he lifted himself strongly from the pillows that propped him, and with staring eyes, called out in savage terror:  ""Is it a cancer?",1
1987,"I say, is it a cancer?""  ""Hush! she cried. No.  Of course not!  Don't be foolish. He fell back exhausted, with eyes closed.",1
1988,"But they knew that it was. He had never been told. The terrible name of his malady was never uttered save by him. And in his heart he knew--what they all knew and never spoke of before him--that it was, it was a cancer. All day, with fear-stark eyes, Gant had sat, like a broken statue, among his marbles, drinking. It was a cancer.",1
1989,"The boy's right hand bled very badly across the wrist, where his father's weight had ground it into the wall. Go wash it off,"" said Helen. I'll tie it up for you. He went into the dark bathroom and held his hand under a jet of lukewarm water.",1
1990,"A very quiet despair was in his heart, a weary peace that brooded too upon the house of death and tumult, that flowed, like a soft exploring wind, through its dark halls, bathing all things quietly with peace and weariness. The boarders had fled like silly sheep to the two houses across the street: they had eaten there, they were clustered there upon the porches, whispering. And their going brought him peace and freedom, as if his limbs had been freed from a shackling weight. Eliza, amid the slow smoke of the kitchen, wept more quietly over the waste of supper; he saw the black mournful calm of the negress's face. He walked slowly up the dark hall, with a handkerchief tied loosely round his wound. He felt suddenly the peace that comes with despair. The sword that pierces very deep had fared through the folds of his poor armor of pride. The steel had sheared his side, had bitten to his heart. But under his armor he had found himself. No more than himself could be known. No more than himself could be given. What he was--he was: evasion and pretense could not add to his sum. With all his heart he was glad.",1
1991,"By the door, in the darkness, he found Laura James. I thought you had gone with the others,"" he said. No,"" said Laura James, ""how is your father?""  ""He's all right now.",1
1992,"He's gone to sleep,"" he answered. Have you had anything to eat?""  ""No,"" she said, ""I didn't want it. I'll bring you something from the kitchen,"" he said.",1
1993,"There's plenty there. In a moment he added:  ""I'm sorry, Laura. What are you sorry for?",1
1994,"she asked. He leaned against the wall limply, drained of his strength at her touch. Eugene. My dear,"" she said. She pulled his drooping face down to her lips and kissed him. My sweet, my darling, don't look like that. All his resistance melted from him.",1
1995,"He seized her small hands, crushing them in his hot fingers, and devouring them with kisses. My dear Laura! My dear Laura! he said in a choking voice. My sweet, my beautiful Laura! My lovely Laura. I love you. I love you. The words rushed from his heart, incoherent, unashamed, foaming through the broken levees of pride and silence. They clung together in the dark, with their wet faces pressed mouth to mouth. Her perfume went drunkenly to his brain; her touch upon him shot through his limbs a glow of magic; he felt the pressure of her narrow breasts, eager and lithe, against him with a sense of fear-- as if he had dishonored her--with a sickening remembrance of his defilement.",1
1996,"He held between his hands her elegant small head, so gloriously wound with its thick bracelet of fine blonde hair, and spoke the words he had never spoken--the words of confession, filled with love and humility. Don't go! Don't go! Please don't go! he begged. Don't leave, dear. Please!""  ""Hush!",1
1997,"she whispered. I won't go! I love you, my dear. She saw his hand, wrapped in its bloody bandage; she nursed it gently with soft little cries of tenderness.",1
1998,"She fetched a bottle of iodine from her room and painted the stinging cut with a brush. She wrapped it with clean strips of fine white cloth, torn from an old waist, scented with a faint and subtle perfume. Then they sat upon the wooden swing. The house seemed to sleep in darkness. Helen and Eliza came presently from its very quiet depth.",1
1999,"How's your hand, 'Gene? Helen asked. It's all right,"" he said.",1
2000,"Let me see! O-ho, you've got a nurse now, haven't you? she said, with a good laugh.",1
2001,"What's that? What's that? Hurt his hand? How'd you do that? Why, here--say--I've got the very thing for it, son,"" said Eliza, trying to bustle off in all directions.",1
2002,"Oh, it's all right now, mama. It's been fixed,"" he said wearily, reflecting that she had the very thing always too late. He looked at Helen grinning:  ""God bless our Happy Home!",1
2003,"he said. Poor old Laura! she laughed, and hugged the girl roughly with one hand. It's too bad you have to be dragged into it. That's all right,"" said Laura.",1
2004,"I feel like one of the family now anyhow. He needn't think he can carry on like this,"" said Eliza resentfully. I'm not going to put up with it any longer. Oh forget about it!"" said Helen wearily.",1
2005,"Good heavens, mama. Papa's a sick man. Can't you realize that?""  ""Pshaw!"" said Eliza scornfully.",1
2006,I don't believe there's a thing in the world wrong with him but that vile licker. All his trouble comes from that. Oh--how ridiculous!,1
2007,How ridiculous! You can't tell me! Helen exclaimed angrily.,1
2008,"Let's talk about the weather,"" said Eugene. Then they all sat quietly, letting the darkness soak into them. Finally Helen and Eliza went back into the house: Eliza went unwillingly, at the girl's insistence, casting back the doubtful glimmer of her face upon the boy and girl.",1
2009,"The wasting helve of the moon rode into heaven over the bulk of the hills. There was a smell of wet grass and lilac, and the vast brooding symphony of the million-noted little night things, rising and falling in a constant ululation, and inhabiting the heart with steady unconscious certitude. The pallid light drowned out the stars, it lay like silence on the earth, it dripped through the leafy web of the young maples, printing the earth with swarming moths of elvish light.",1
2010,"Eugene and Laura sat with joined hands in the slowly creaking swing. Her touch shot through him like a train of fire: as he put his arm around her shoulders and drew her over to him, his fingers touched the live firm cup of her breast. He jerked his hand away, as if he had been stung, muttering an apology. Whenever she touched him, his flesh got numb and weak. She was a virgin, crisp like celery--his heart shrank away from the pollution of his touch upon her. It seemed to him that he was much the older, although he was sixteen, and she twenty-one. He felt the age of his loneliness and his dark perception. He felt the gray wisdom of sin--a waste desert, but seen and known. When he held her hand, he felt as if he had already seduced her. She lifted her lovely face to him, pert and ugly as a boy's; it was inhabited by a true and steadfast decency, and his eyes were wet. All the young beauty in the world dwelt for him in that face that had kept wonder, that had kept innocency, that had lived in such immortal blindness to the terror and foulness of the world. He came to her, like a creature who had travelled its life through dark space, for a moment of peace and conviction on some lonely planet, where now he stood, in the vast enchanted plain of moonlight, with moonlight falling on the moonflower of her face. For if a man should dream of heaven and, waking, find within his hand a flower as token that he had really been there--what then, what then?  ""Eugene,"" she said presently, ""how old are you?""  His vision thickened with his pulse.",1
2011,"In a moment he answered with terrible difficulty. I'm--just sixteen.""  ""Oh, you child! she cried. I thought you were more than that!""  ""I'm--old for my age,"" he muttered.",1
2012,"How old are you?""  ""I'm twenty-one,"" she said. Isn't it a pity?""  ""There's not much difference,"" he said. I can't see that it matters. Oh, my dear,"" she said.",1
2013,"It does! It matters so much! And he knew that it did--how much he did not know. But he had his moment. He was not afraid of pain, he was not afraid of loss. He cared nothing for the practical need of the world. He dared to say the strange and marvellous thing that had bloomed so darkly in him.",1
2014,"Laura,"" he said, hearing his low voice sound over the great plain of the moon, ""let's always love each other as we do now. Let's never get married. I want you to wait for me and to love me forever. I am going all over the world. I shall go away for years at a time; I shall become famous, but I shall always come back to you. You shall live in a house away in the mountains, you shall wait for me, and keep yourself for me. Will you?"" he said, asking for her life as calmly as for an hour of her time.",1
2015,"Yes, dear,"" said Laura in the moonlight, ""I will wait for you forever. She was buried in his flesh. She throbbed in the beat of his pulses. She was wine in his blood, a music in his heart.",1
2016,"He has no consideration for you or any one else,"" Hugh Barton growled. He had returned late from work at his office, to take Helen home. If he can't do better than this, we'll find a house of our own. I'm not going to have you get down sick on account of him. Forget about it,"" Helen said.",1
2017,"He's getting old. They came out on the veranda. Come down to-morrow, honey,"" she said to Eugene. I'll give you a real feed. Laura, you come too. It's not always like this, you know. She laughed, fondling the girl with a big hand.",1
2018,"They coasted away downhill. What a lovely girl your sister is,"" said Laura James. Aren't you simply crazy about her?""  Eugene made no answer for a moment.",1
2019,"Yes,"" he said. She is about you. Any one can see that,"" said Laura.",1
2020,"In the darkness he caught at his throat. Yes,"" he said. The moon quartered gently across heaven. Eliza came out again, timidly, hesitantly.",1
2021,"Who's there? Who's there? she spoke into the darkness. Where's 'Gene? Oh!  I didn't know! Are you there, son? She knew very well.",1
2022,"Yes,"" he said. Why don't you sit down, Mrs. Gant?"" asked Laura. I don't see how you stand that hot kitchen all day long. You must be worn out. I tell you what!"" said Eliza, peering dimly at the sky.",1
2023,"It's a fine night, isn't it? As the fellow says, a night for lovers. She laughed uncertainly, then stood for a moment in thought.",1
2024,"Son,"" she said in a troubled voice, ""why don't you go to bed and get some sleep? It's not good for you staying up till all hours like this. That's where I should be,"" said Laura James, rising.",1
2025,"Yes, child,"" said Eliza. Go get your beauty sleep. As the saying goes, early to bed and early to rise--""  ""Let's all go, then.",1
2026,"Let's all go!"" said Eugene impatiently and angrily, wondering if she must always be the last one awake in that house. Why law, no!"" said Eliza. I can't, boy. I've all those things to iron. Beside him, Laura gave his hand a quiet squeeze, and rose.",1
2027,"Bitterly, he watched his loss. Good-night, all. Good-night, Mrs. Gant. Good-night, child.",1
2028,"When she had gone, Eliza sat down beside him, with a sigh of weariness. I tell you what,"" she said. That feels good. I wish I had as much time as some folks, and could sit out here enjoying the air. In the darkness, he knew her puckering lips were trying to smile.",1
2029,"Hm! she said, and caught his hand in her rough palm. Has my baby gone and got him a girl?""  ""What of it?",1
2030,"What if it were true?"" he said angrily. Haven't I a right as much as any one?""  ""Pshaw!"" said Eliza. You're too young to think of them. I wouldn't pay any attention to them, if I were you. Most of them haven't an idea in the world except going out to parties and having a good time. I don't want my boy to waste his time on them. He felt her earnestness beneath her awkward banter.",1
2031,"He struggled in a chaos of confused fury, trying for silence. At last he spoke in a low voice, filled with his passion:  ""We've got to have something, mama. We've got to have something, you know. We can't go on always alone--alone. It was dark.",1
2032,No one could see. He let the gates swing open. He wept.,1
2033,"I know! Eliza agreed hastily. I'm not saying--""  ""My God, my God, where are we going?",1
2034,"What's it all about? He's dying--can't you see it? Don't you know it? Look at his life. Look at yours. No light, no love, no comfort--nothing. His voice rose frantically: he beat on his ribs like a drum. Mama, mama, in God's name, what is it? What do you want? Are you going to strangle and drown us all? Don't you own enough? Do you want more string? Do you want more bottles? By God, I'll go around collecting them if you say so. His voice had risen almost to a scream. But tell me what you want. Don't you own enough? Do you want the town? What is it?""  ""Why, I don't know what you're talking about, boy,"" said Eliza angrily.",1
2035,"If I hadn't tried to accumulate a little property none of you would have had a roof to call your own, for your papa, I can assure you, would have squandered everything. A roof to call our own! he yelled, with a crazy laugh. Good God, we haven't a bed to call our own. We haven't a room to call our own. We have not a quilt to call our own that might not be taken from us to warm the mob that rocks upon this porch and grumbles. Now, you may sneer at the boarders all you like--"" Eliza began sternly.",1
2036,"No,"" he said. I can't. There's not breath or strength enough in me to sneer at them all I like. Eliza began to weep.",1
2037,"I've done the best I could! she said. I'd have given you a home if I could. I'd have put up with anything after Grover's death, but he never gave me a moment's peace. Nobody knows what I've been through. Nobody knows, child. Nobody knows. He saw her face in the moonlight, contorted by an ugly grimace of sorrow.",1
2038,"What she had said, he knew, was fair and honest. He was touched deeply. It's all right, mama,"" he said painfully. Forget about it! I know. She seized his hand almost gratefully and laid her white face, still twisted with her grief, against his shoulder.",1
2039,"It was the gesture of a child; a gesture that asked for love, pity, and tenderness. It tore up great roots in him, bloodily. Don't! he said. Don't, mama! Please!""  ""Nobody knows,"" said Eliza.",1
2040,"Nobody knows. I need some one too. I've had a hard life, son, full of pain and trouble. Slowly, like a child again, she wiped her wet weak eyes with the back of her hand.",1
2041,"Ah, he thought, as his heart twisted in him full of wild pain and regret, she will be dead some day and I shall always remember this. Always this. This.",1
2042,"They were silent a moment. He held her rough hand tightly, and kissed her. Well,"" Eliza began, full of cheerful prophecy, ""I tell you what: I'm not going to spend my life slaving away here for a lot of boarders. They needn't think it. I'm going to set back and take things as easy as any of them. She winked knowingly at him. When you come home next time, you may find me living in a big house in Doak Park. I've got the lot--the best lot out there for view and location, far better than the one W. J. Bryan has. I made the trade with old Dr. Doak himself, the other day. Look here! What about! She laughed. He said, 'Mrs. Gant, I can't trust any of my agents with you. If I'm to make anything on this deal, I've got to look out. You're the sharpest trader in this town.' 'Why, pshaw! Doctor,' I said (I never let on I believed him or anything), 'all I want is a fair return on my investment. I believe in every one making his profit and giving the other fellow a chance. Keep the ball a-rolling!' I said, laughing as big as you please. 'Why, Mrs. Gant!' he said-- She was off on a lengthy divagation, recording with an absorbed gusto the interminable minutia of her transaction with the worthy Quinine King, with the attendant phenomena, during the time, of birds, bees, flowers, sun, clouds, dogs, cows, and people. She was pleased. She was happy.",1
2043,"Presently, returning to an abrupt reflective pause, she said: ""Well, I may do it. I want a place where my children can come to see me and bring their friends, when they come home. Yes,"" he said, ""yes.",1
2044,"That would be nice. You mustn't work all your life. He was pleased at her happy fable: for a moment he almost believed in a miracle of redemption, although the story was an old one to him.",1
2045,"I hope you do,"" he said. It would be nice. . . . Go on to bed now, why don't you, mama? It's getting late. He rose. I'm going now. Yes, son,"" she said, getting up.",1
2046,"You ought to. Well, good- night. They kissed with a love, for the time, washed clean of bitterness. Eliza went before him into the dark house.",1
2047,"But before he went to bed, he descended to the kitchen for matches. She was still there, beyond the long littered table, at her ironing board, flanked by two big piles of laundry. At his accusing glance she said hastily:  ""I'm a-going.",1
2048,"Right away. I just wanted to finish up these towels. He rounded the table, before he left, to kiss her again.",1
2049,"She fished into a button-box on the sewing-machine and dug out the stub of a pencil. Gripping it firmly above an old envelope, she scrawled out on the ironing board a rough mapping. Her mind was still lulled in its project.",1
2050,"Here, you see,"" she began, ""is Sunset Avenue, coming up the hill. This is Doak Place, running off here at right angles. Now this corner-lot here belongs to Dick Webster; and right here above it, at the very top is--""  Is, he thought, staring with dull interest, the place where the Buried Treasure lies.",1
2051,"Ten paces N.N.E. from the Big Rock, at the roots of the Old Oak Tree. He went off into his delightful fantasy while she talked. What if there WAS a buried treasure on one of Eliza's lots? If she kept on buying, there might very well be. Or why not an oil-well? Or a coal-mine? These famous mountains were full (they said) of minerals. 150 Bbl. a day right in the backyard. How much would that be? At $3.00 a Bbl., there would be over $50.00 a day for every one in the family. The world is ours!",1
2052,"You see, don't you? she smiled triumphantly. And right there is where I shall build. That lot will bring twice its present value in five years. Yes,"" he said, kissing her.",1
2053,"Good-night, mama. For God's sake, go to bed and get some sleep. Good-night, son,"" said Eliza.",1
2054,"He went out and began to mount the dark stairs. Benjamin Gant, entering at this moment, stumbled across a mission-chair in the hall. He cursed fiercely, and struck at the chair with his hand. Damn it! Oh damn it! Mrs. Pert whispered a warning behind him, with a fuzzy laugh. Eugene paused, then mounted softly the carpeted stair, so that he would not be heard, entering the sleeping-porch at the top of the landing on which he slept.",1
2055,"He did not turn on the light, because he disliked seeing the raw blistered varnish of the dresser and the bent white iron of the bed. It sagged, and the light was dim--he hated dim lights, and the large moths, flapping blindly around on their dusty wings. He undressed in the moon. The moonlight fell upon the earth like a magic unearthly dawn. It wiped away all rawness, it hid all sores. It gave all common and familiar things--the sagging drift of the barn, the raw shed of the creamery, the rich curve of the lawyer's crab-apple trees--a uniform bloom of wonder. He lighted a cigarette, watching its red glowing suspiration in the mirror, and leaned upon the rail of his porch, looking out. Presently, he grew aware that Laura James, eight feet away, was watching him. The moonlight fell upon them, bathing their flesh in a green pallor, and steeping them in its silence. Their faces were blocked in miraculous darkness, out of which, seeing but unseen, their bright eyes lived. They gazed at each other in that elfin light, without speaking. In the room below them, the light crawled to his father's bed, swam up the cover, and opened across his face, thrust sharply upward. The air of the night, the air of the hills, fell on the boy's bare flesh like a sluice of clear water. His toes curled in to grip wet grasses.",1
2056,"On the landing, he heard Mrs. Pert go softly up to bed, fumbling with blind care at the walls. Doors creaked and clicked. The house grew solidly into quiet, like a stone beneath the moon. They looked, waiting for a spell and the conquest of time. Then she spoke to him--her whisper of his name was only a guess at sound. He threw his leg across the rail, and thrust his long body over space to the sill of her window, stretching out like a cat. She drew her breath in sharply, and cried out softly, ""No! No! but she caught his arms upon the sills and held him as he twisted in.",1
2057,"Then they held each other tightly in their cool young arms, and kissed many times with young lips and faces. All her hair fell down about her like thick corn-silk, in a sweet loose wantonness. Her straight dainty legs were clad in snug little green bloomers, gathered in by an elastic above the knee.",1
2058,"They were locked limb to limb: he kissed the smooth sheen of her arms and shoulders--the passion that numbed his limbs was governed by a religious ecstasy. He wanted to hold her, and go away by himself to think about her. He stooped, thrusting his arm under her knees, and lifted her up exultantly. She looked at him frightened, holding him more tightly.",1
2059,"What are you doing? she whispered. Don't hurt me. I won't hurt you, my dear,"" he said.",1
2060,I'm going to put you to bed. Yes. I'm going to put you to bed. Do you hear? He felt he must cry out in his throat for joy.,1
2061,"He carried her over and laid her on the bed. Then he knelt beside her, putting his arm beneath her and gathering her to him. Good-night, my dear. Kiss me good-night. Do you love me?""  ""Yes.",1
2062,"She kissed him. Good-night, my darling. Don't go back by the window. You may fall.",1
2063,"But he went, as he came, reaching through the moonlight exultantly like a cat. For a long time he lay awake, in a quiet delirium, his heart thudding fiercely against his ribs. Sleep crept across his senses with goose-soft warmth: the young leaves of the maples rustled, a cock sounded his distant elfin minstrelsy, the ghost of a dog howled. He slept.",1
2064,"He awoke with a high hot sun beating in on his face through the porch awnings. He hated to awake in sunlight. Some day he would sleep in a great room that was always cool and dark. There would be trees and vines at his windows, or the scooped-out lift of the hill. His clothing was wet with night-damp as he dressed. When he went downstairs he found Gant rocking miserably upon the porch, his hand gripped over a walkingstick.",1
2065,"Good-morning,"" he said, ""how do you feel?""  His father cast his uneasy flickering eyes on him, and groaned. Merciful God! I'm being punished for my sins. You'll feel better in a little,"" said Eugene.",1
2066,"Did you eat anything? It stuck in my throat,"" said Gant, who had eaten heartily. I couldn't swallow a bite. How's your hand, son? he asked very humbly.",1
2067,"Oh, it's all right,"" said Eugene quickly. Who told you about my hand?""  ""She said I had hurt your hand,"" said Gant sorrowfully. Ah-h!"" said the boy angrily. No.  I wasn't hurt. Gant leaned to the side and, without looking, clumsily, patted his son's uninjured hand.",1
2068,"I'm sorry for what I've done,"" he said. I'm a sick man. Do you need money?""  ""No,"" said Eugene, embarrassed.",1
2069,"I have all I need. Come to the office to-day, and I'll give you something,"" said Gant. Poor child, I suppose you're hard up.",1
2070,"But instead, he waited until Laura James returned from her morning visit to the city's bathing-pool. She came with her bathing-suit in one hand, and several small packages in the other. More arrived by negro carriers. She paid and signed,  ""You must have a lot of money, Laura?"" he said.",1
2071,"You do this every day, don't you?""  ""Daddy gets after me about it,"" she admitted, ""but I love to buy clothes. I spend all my money on clothes. What are you going to do now?""  ""Nothing--whatever you like.",1
2072,"It's a lovely day to do something, isn't it?""  ""It's a lovely day to do nothing. Would you like to go off somewhere, Laura?""  ""I'd love to go off somewhere with you,"" said Laura James. That is the idea, my girl. That is the idea,"" he said exultantly, in throaty and exuberant burlesque. We will go off somewhere alone--we will take along something to eat,"" he said lusciously.",1
2073,"Laura went to her room and put on a pair of sturdy little slippers. Eugene went into the kitchen. Have you a shoe-box?"" he asked Eliza.",1
2074,"What do you want that for? she said suspiciously. I'm going to the bank,"" he said ironically. I wanted something to carry my money in. But immediately he added roughly:  ""I'm going on a picnic.",1
2075,"Huh?  Hah? What's that you say?"" said Eliza. A picnic? Who are you going with? That girl?""  ""No,"" he said heavily, ""with President Wilson, the King of England, and Dr. Doak.",1
2076,"We're going to have lemonade--I've promised to bring the lemons. I'll vow, boy!"" said Eliza fretfully. I don't like it--your running off this way when I need you. I wanted you to make a deposit for me, and the telephone people will disconnect me if I don't send them the money to-day. O mama!",1
2077,"For God's sake! he cried annoyed. You always need me when I want to go somewhere. Let them wait! They can wait a day. It's overdue,"" she said.",1
2078,"Well, here you are. I wish I had time to go off on picnics. She fished a shoe-box out of a pile of magazines and newspapers that littered the top of a low cupboard.",1
2079,"Have you got anything to eat?""  ""We'll get it,"" he said, and departed. They went down the hill, and paused at the musty little grocery around the corner on Woodson Street, where they bought crackers, peanut butter, currant jelly, bottled pickles, and a big slice of rich yellow cheese. The grocer was an old Jew who muttered jargon into a rabbi's beard as if saying a spell against Dybbuks. The boy looked closely to see if his hands touched the food. They were not clean.",1
2080,"On their way up the hill, they stopped for a few minutes at Gant's. They found Helen and Ben in the dining-room. Ben was eating breakfast, bending, as usual, with scowling attention, over his coffee, turning from eggs and bacon almost with disgust. Helen insisted on contributing boiled eggs and sandwiches to their provision: the two women went back into the kitchen. Eugene sat at table with Ben, drinking coffee.",1
2081,"O-oh my God! Ben said at length, yawning wearily. He lighted a cigarette. How's the Old Man this morning?""  ""He's all right, I think.",1
2082,"Said he couldn't eat breakfast. Did he say anything to the boarders?""  ""'You damned scoundrels! You dirty Mountain Grills!  Whee--!' That was all. Ben snickered quietly.",1
2083,Did he hurt your hand? Let's see. No.  You can't see anything.,1
2084,"It's not hurt,"" said Eugene, lifting his bandaged wrist. He didn't hit you, did he? asked Ben sternly.",1
2085,"Oh, no. Of course not. He was just drunk. He was sorry about it this morning. Yes,"" said Ben, ""he's always sorry about it--after he's raised all the hell he can.",1
2086,"He drank deeply at his cigarette, inhaling the smoke as if in the grip of a powerful drug. How'd you get along at college this year, 'Gene?"" he asked presently. I passed my work. I made fair grades--if that's what you mean? I did better--this Spring,"" he added, with some difficulty. It was hard getting started--at the beginning. You mean last Fall?""  Eugene nodded.",1
2087,"What was the matter?"" said Ben, scowling at him. Did the other boys make fun of you?""  ""Yes,"" said Eugene, in a low voice. Why did they? You mean they didn't think you were good enough for them? Did they look down on you? Was that it?"" said Ben savagely.",1
2088,"No,"" said Eugene, very red in the face. No.  That had nothing to do with it. I look funny, I suppose. I looked funny to them. What do you mean you look funny?"" said Ben pugnaciously.",1
2089,"There's nothing wrong with you, you know, if you didn't go around looking like a bum. In God's name,"" he exclaimed angrily, ""when did you get that hair cut last? What do you think you are: the Wild Man from Borneo?""  ""I don't like barbers!",1
2090,"Eugene burst out furiously. That's why! I don't want them to go sticking their damned dirty fingers in my mouth. Whose business is it, if I never get my hair cut?""  ""A man is judged by his appearance to-day,"" said Ben sententiously.",1
2091,"I was reading an article by a big business man in The Post the other day. He says he always looks at a man's shoes before he gives him a job. He spoke seriously, haltingly, in the same way that he read, without genuine conviction.",1
2092,"Eugene writhed to hear his fierce condor prattle this stale hash of the canny millionaires, like any obedient parrot in a teller's cage. Ben's voice had a dull flat quality as he uttered these admirable opinions: he seemed to grope behind it all for some answer, with hurt puzzled eyes. As he faltered along, with scowling intensity, through a success-sermon, there was something poignantly moving in his effort: it was the effort of his strange and lonely spirit to find some entrance into life--to find success, position, companionship. And it was as if, spelling the words out with his mouth, a settler in the Bronx from the fat Lombard plain, should try to unriddle the new world by deciphering the World Almanac, or as if some woodsman, trapped by the winter, and wasted by an obscure and terrible disease, should hunt its symptoms and its cure in a book of Household Remedies.",1
2093,"Did the Old Man send you enough money to get along on? Ben asked. Were you able to hold your own with the other boys? He can afford it, you know. Don't let him stint you. Make him give it to you, 'Gene. I had plenty,"" said Eugene, ""all that I needed.",1
2094,"This is the time you need it--not later,"" said Ben.  ""Make him put you through college. This is an age of specialization. They're looking for college-trained men. Yes,"" said Eugene.",1
2095,"He spoke obediently, indifferently, the hard bright mail of his mind undinted by the jargon: within, the Other One, who had no speech, saw. So get your education,"" said Ben, scowling vaguely. All the Big Men--Ford, Edison, Rockefeller--whether they had it or not, say it's a good thing. Why didn't you go yourself?"" said Eugene curiously.",1
2096,"I didn't have any one to tell me,"" said Ben. Besides, you don't think the Old Man would give me anything, do you? He laughed cynically. It's too late now. He was silent a moment; he smoked.",1
2097,"You didn't know I was taking a course in advertising, did you? he asked, grinning. No.  Where?""  ""Through the Correspondence School,"" said Ben.",1
2098,"I get my lessons every week. I don't know,"" he laughed diffidently, ""I must be good at it. I make the highest grades they have--98 or 100 every time. I get a diploma, if I finish the course. A blinding mist swam across the younger brother's eyes.",1
2099,"He did not know why. A convulsive knot gathered in his throat. He bent his head quickly and fumbled for his cigarettes. In a moment he said:  ""I'm glad you're doing it.",1
2100,"I hope you finish, Ben.""  ""You know,"" Ben said seriously, ""they've turned out some Big Men. I'll show you the testimonials some time. Men who started with nothing: now they're holding down big jobs. I hope you do,"" said Eugene.",1
2101,"So, you see you're not the only College Man around here,"" said Ben with a grin. In a moment, he went on gravely:  ""You're the last hope, 'Gene. Go on and finish up, if you have to steal the money. The rest of us will never amount to a damn. Try to make something out of yourself. Hold your head up! You're as good as any of them--a damn sight better than these little pimps about town. He became very fierce; he was very excited. He got up suddenly from the table. Don't let them laugh at you! By God, we're as good as they are. If any of them laughs at you again, pick up the first damn thing you get your hand on and knock him down. Do you hear? In his fierce excitement he snatched up the heavy carving steel from the table and brandished it.",1
2102,"Yes,"" said Eugene awkwardly. I think it's going to be all right now. I didn't know how to do at first. I hope you have sense enough now to leave those old hookers alone?"" said Ben very sternly.",1
2103,"Eugene made no answer. You can't do that and be anything, you know. And you're likely to catch everything. This looks like a nice girl,"" he said quietly, after a pause. For heaven's sake, fix yourself up and try to keep fairly clean. Women notice that, you know. Look at your fingernails, and keep your clothes pressed. Have you any money?""  ""All I need,"" said Eugene, looking nervously toward the kitchen.",1
2104,"Don't, for God's sake!""  ""Put it in your pocket, you little fool,"" Ben said angrily, thrusting a bill into his hand. You've got to have some money. Keep it until you need it. Helen came out on the high front porch with them as they departed.",1
2105,"As usual, she had added a double heaping measure to what they needed. There was another shoe-box stuffed with sandwiches, boiled eggs, and fudge. She stood on the high step-edge, with a cloth wound over her head, her gaunt arms, pitted with old scars, akimbo. A warm sunny odor of nasturtiums, loamy earth, and honeysuckle washed round them its hot spermy waves.",1
2106,"O-ho! A-ha! she winked comically. I know something! I'm not as blind as you think, you know-- She nodded with significant jocularity, her big smiling face drenched in the curious radiance and purity that occasionally dwelt so beautifully there. He thought always when he saw her thus, of a sky washed after rain, of wide crystalline distances, cool and clean.",1
2107,"With a rough snigger she prodded him in the ribs:  ""Ain't love grand! Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Look at his face, Laura. She drew the girl close to her in a generous hug, laughing, Oh, with laughing pity, and as they mounted the hill, she stood there, in the sunlight, her mouth slightly open, smiling, touched with radiance, beauty, and wonder.",1
2108,"They mounted slowly toward the eastern edge of town, by the long upward sweep of Academy Street, which bordered the negro settlement sprawled below it. At the end of Academy Street, the hill loomed abruptly; a sinuous road, well paved, curved up along the hillside to the right. They turned into this road, mounting now along the eastern edge of Niggertown. The settlement fell sharply away below them, rushing down along a series of long clay streets. There were a few frame houses by the roadside: the dwellings of negroes and poor white people, but these became sparser as they mounted. They walked at a leisurely pace up the cool road speckled with little dancing patches of light that filtered through the arching trees and shaded on the left by the dense massed foliage of the hill. Out of this green loveliness loomed the huge raw turret of a cement reservoir: it was streaked and blotted coolly with water-marks. Eugene felt thirsty. Further along, the escape from a smaller reservoir roared from a pipe in a foaming hawser, as thick as a man's body.",1
2109,"They climbed sharply up, along a rocky trail, avoiding the last long corkscrew of the road, and stood in the gap, at the road's summit. They were only a few hundred feet above the town: it lay before them with the sharp nearness of a Sienese picture, at once close and far. On the highest ground, he saw the solid masonry of the Square, blocked cleanly out in light and shadow, and a crawling toy that was a car, and men no bigger than sparrows. And about the Square was the treeless brick jungle of business--cheap, ragged, and ugly, and beyond all this, in indefinite patches, the houses where all the people lived, with little bright raw ulcers of suburbia further off, and the healing and concealing grace of fair massed trees. And below him, weltering up from the hollow along the flanks and shoulders of the hill, was Niggertown. There seemed to be a kind of centre at the Square, where all the cars crawled in and waited, yet there was no purpose anywhere.",1
2110,"But the hills were lordly, with a plan. Westward, they widened into the sun, soaring up from buttressing shoulders. The town was thrown up on the plateau like an encampment: there was nothing below him that could resist time. There was no idea. Below him, in a cup, he felt that all life was held: he saw it as might one of the old schoolmen writing in monkish Latin a Theatre of Human Life; or like Peter Breughel, in one of his swarming pictures. It seemed to him suddenly that he had not come up on the hill from the town, but that he had come out of the wilderness like a beast, and was staring now with steady beast-eye at this little huddle of wood and mortar which the wilderness must one day repossess, devour, cover over.",1
2111,"The seventh from the top was Troy--but Helen had lived there; and so the German dug it up. They turned from the railing, with recovered wind, and walked through the gap, under Philip Roseberry's great arched bridge. To the left, on the summit, the rich Jew had his cattle, his stables, his horses, his cows, and his daughters. As they went under the shadow of the bridge Eugene lifted his head and shouted. His voice bounded against the arch like a stone. They passed under and stood on the other side of the gap, looking from the road's edge down into the cove. But they could not yet see the cove, save for green glimmers. The hillside was thickly wooded, the road wound down its side in a white perpetual corkscrew. But they could look across at the fair wild hills on the other side of the cove, cleared halfway up their flanks with ample field and fenced meadow, and forested above with a billowing sea of greenery.",1
2112,"The day was like gold and sapphires: there was a swift flash and sparkle, intangible and multifarious, like sunlight on roughened water, all over the land. A rich warm wind was blowing, turning all the leaves back the same way, and making mellow music through all the lute-strings of flower and grass and fruit. The wind moaned, not with the mad fiend-voice of winter in harsh boughs, but like a fruitful woman, deep-breasted, great, full of love and wisdom; like Demeter unseen and hunting through the world. A dog bayed faintly in the cove, his howl spent and broken by the wind. A cowbell tinkled gustily. In the thick wood below them the rich notes of birds fell from their throats, straight down, like nuggets. A woodpecker drummed on the dry unbarked hole of a blasted chestnut-tree. The blue gulf of the sky was spread with light massy clouds: they cruised like swift galleons, tacking across the hills before the wind, and darkening the trees below with their floating shadows.",1
2113,"The boy grew blind with love and desire: the cup of his heart was glutted with all this wonder. It overcame and weakened him. He grasped the girl's cool fingers. They stood leg to leg, riven into each other's flesh. Then they left the road, cutting down across its loops along steep wooded paths. The wood was a vast green church; the bird-cries fell like plums. A great butterfly, with wings of blue velvet streaked with gold and scarlet markings, fluttered heavily before them in freckled sunlight, tottering to rest finally upon a spray of dogwood. There were light skimming noises in the dense undergrowth to either side, the swift bullet- shadows of birds. A garter snake, greener than wet moss, as long as a shoelace and no thicker than a woman's little finger, shot across the path, its tiny eyes bright with terror, its small forked tongue playing from its mouth like an electric spark. Laura cried out, drawing back in sharp terror; at her cry he snatched up a stone in a wild lust to kill the tiny creature that shot at them, through its coils, the old snake-fear, touching them with beauty, with horror, with something supernatural. But the snake glided away into the undergrowth and, with a feeling of strong shame, he threw the stone away. They won't hurt you,"" he said.",1
2114,"At length, they came out above the cove, at a forking of the road. They turned left, to the north, toward the upper and smaller end. To the south, the cove widened out in a rich little Eden of farm and pasture. Small houses dotted the land, there were green meadows and a glint of water. Fields of young green wheat bent rhythmically under the wind; the young corn stood waist-high, with light clashing blades. The chimneys of Rheinhart's house showed above its obscuring grove of maples; the fat dairy cows grazed slowly across the wide pastures. And further below, half tree-and- shrub-hidden, lay the rich acres of Judge Webster Tayloe. The road was thickly coated with white dust; it dipped down and ran through a little brook. They crossed over on white rocks, strewn across its bed. Several ducks, scarcely disturbed by their crossing, waddled up out of the clear water and regarded them gravely, like little children in white choir aprons. A young country fellow clattered by them in a buggy filled with empty milk-cans. He grinned with a cordial red face, saluting them with a slow gesture, and leaving behind an odor of milk and sweat and butter. A woman, in a field above them, stared curiously with shaded eyes. In another field, a man was mowing with a scythe, moving into the grass like a god upon his enemies, with a reaping hook of light.",1
2115,"They left the road near the head of the cove, advancing over the fields on rising ground to the wooded cup of the hills. There was a powerful masculine stench of broad dock-leaves, a hot weedy odor. They moved over a pathless field, knee-high in a dry stubbly waste, gathering on their clothes clusters of brown cockle-burrs. All the field was sown with hot odorous daisies. Then they entered the wood again, mounting until they came to an island of tender grass, by a little brook that fell down from the green hill along a rocky ferny bed in bright cascades.",1
2116,"Let's stop here,"" said Eugene. The grass was thick with dandelions: their poignant and wordless odor studded the earth with yellow magic. They were like gnomes and elves, and tiny witchcraft in flower and acorn.",1
2117,"Laura and Eugene lay upon their backs, looking up through the high green shimmer of leaves at the Caribbean sky, with all its fleet of cloudy ships. The water of the brook made a noise like silence. The town behind the hill lay in another unthinkable world. They forgot its pain and conflict.",1
2118,"What time is it? Eugene asked. For, they had come to a place where no time was. Laura held up her exquisite wrist, and looked at her watch.",1
2119,"Why!"" she exclaimed, surprised. It's only half-past twelve! But he scarcely heard her.",1
2120,"What do I care what time it is! he said huskily, and he seized the lovely hand, bound with its silken watch-cord, and kissed it. Her long cool fingers closed around his own; she drew his face down to her mouth.",1
2121,"They lay there, locked together, upon that magic carpet, in that paradise. Her gray eyes were deeper and clearer than a pool of clear water; he kissed the little freckles on her rare skin; he gazed reverently at the snub tilt of her nose; he watched the mirrored dance of the sparkling water over her face. All of that magic world--flower and field and sky and hill, and all the sweet woodland cries, sound and sight and odor--grew into him, one voice in his heart, one tongue in his brain, harmonious, radiant, and whole--a single passionate lyrical noise.",1
2122,"My dear! Darling! Do you remember last night? he asked fondly, as if recalling some event of her childhood.",1
2123,"Yes,"" she gathered her arms tightly about his neck, ""why do you think I could forget it?""  ""Do you remember what I said--what I asked you to do?"" he insisted eagerly. Oh, what are we going to do? What are we going to do? she moaned, turning her head to the side and flinging an arm across her eyes.",1
2124,"What is it? What's the matter? Dear?""  ""Eugene--my dear, you're only a child.",1
2125,"I'm so old--a grown woman. You're only twenty-one,"" he said. There's only five years' difference. That's nothing. Oh!"" she said.",1
2126,"You don't know what you're saying. It's all the difference in the world. When I'm twenty, you'll be twenty-five.",1
2127,"When I'm twenty-six, you'll be thirty-one. When I'm forty-eight, you'll be fifty-three. What's that? he said contemptuously. Nothing.""  ""Everything,"" she said, ""everything.",1
2128,"If I were sixteen, and you twenty-one it would be nothing. But you're a boy and I'm a woman. When you're a young man I'll be an old maid; when you grow old I shall be dying. How do you know where you'll be, what you'll be doing five years from now? she continued in a moment. You're only a boy--you've just started college. You have no plans yet. You don't know what you're going to do. Yes, I do!",1
2129,"he yelled furiously. I'm going to be a lawyer. That's what they're sending me for. I'm going to be a lawyer, and I'm going into politics. Perhaps,"" he added with gloomy pleasure, ""you'll be sorry then, after I make a name for myself. With bitter joy he foresaw his lonely celebrity. The Governor's Mansion. Forty rooms. Alone. Alone.",1
2130,"You're going to be a lawyer,"" said Laura, ""and you're going everywhere in the world, and I'm to wait for you, and never get married. You poor kid! She laughed softly. You don't know what you're going to do. He turned a face of misery on her; brightness dropped from the sun.",1
2131,"You don't care?"" he choked. You don't care? He bent his head to hide his wet eyes.",1
2132,"Oh, my dear,"" she said, ""I do care. But people don't live like that. It's like a story. Don't you know that I'm a grown woman? At my age, dear, most girls have begun to think of getting married. What--what if I had begun to think of it, too?""  ""Married!",1
2133,"The word came from him in a huge gasp of horror as if she had mentioned the abominable, proposed the unspeakable. Then, having heard the monstrous suggestion, he immediately accepted it as a fact. He was like that.",1
2134,"So! That's it! he said furiously. You're going to get married, eh? You have fellows, have you? You go out with them, do you? You've known it all the time, and you've tried to fool me. Nakedly, with breast bare to horror, he scourged himself, knowing in the moment that the nightmare cruelty of life is not in the remote and fantastic, but in the probable--the horror of love, loss, marriage, the ninety seconds treason in the dark.",1
2135,"You have fellows--you let them feel you. They feel your legs, they play with your breasts, they-- His voice became inaudible through strangulation.",1
2136,"No.  No, my dear. I haven't said so,"" she rose swiftly to a sitting position, taking his hands. But there's nothing unusual about getting married, you know. Most people do. Oh, my dear! Don't look like that! Nothing has happened. Nothing!  Nothing!",1
2137,"He seized her fiercely, unable to speak. Then he buried his face in her neck. Laura! My dear! My sweet!  Don't leave me alone! I've been alone! I've always been alone! It's what you want, dear.",1
2138,It's what you'll always want. You couldn't stand anything else. You'd get so tired of me. You'll forget this ever happened. You'll forget me. You'll forget-- forget. Forget!,1
2139,I'll never forget! I won't live long enough. And I'll never love any one else!,1
2140,"I'll never leave you! I'll wait for you forever! Oh, my child, my child!""  They clung together in that bright moment of wonder, there on the magic island, where the world was quiet, believing all they said.",1
2141,"And who shall say--whatever disenchantment follows--that we ever forget magic, or that we can ever betray, on this leaden earth, the apple-tree, the singing, and the gold? Far out beyond that timeless valley, a train, on the rails for the East, wailed back its ghostly cry: life, like a fume of painted smoke, a broken wrack of cloud, drifted away. Their world was a singing voice again: they were young and they could never die. This would endure.",1
2142,"He kissed her on her splendid eyes; he grew into her young Mænad's body, his heart numbed deliciously against the pressure of her narrow breasts. She was as lithe and yielding to his sustaining hand as a willow rod--she was bird-swift, more elusive in repose than the dancing water-motes upon her face. He held her tightly lest she grow into the tree again, or be gone amid the wood like smoke.",1
2143,"Come up into the hills, O my young love. Return! O lost, and by the wind grieved, ghost, come back again, as first I knew you in the timeless valley, where we shall feel ourselves anew, bedded on magic in the month of June. There was a place where all the sun went glistening in your hair, and from the hill we could have put a finger on a star. Where is the day that melted into one rich noise? Where the music of your flesh, the rhyme of your teeth, the dainty languor of your legs, your small firm arms, your slender fingers, to be bitten like an apple, and the little cherry-teats of your white breasts? And where are all the tiny wires of finespun maidenhair? Quick are the mouths of earth, and quick the teeth that fed upon this loveliness. You who were made for music, will hear music no more: in your dark house the winds are silent. Ghost, ghost, come back from that marriage that we did not foresee, return not into life, but into magic, where we have never died, into the enchanted wood, where we still lie, strewn on the grass. Come up into the hills, O my young love: return. O lost, and by the wind grieved, ghost, come back again.",1
2144,"31   One day, when June was coming to its end, Laura James said to him:  ""I shall have to go home next week. Then, seeing his stricken face, she added, ""but only for a few days--not more than a week. But why?",1
2145,The summer's only started. You will burn up down there. Yes.,1
2146,"It's silly, I know. But my people expect me for the Fourth of July. You know, we have an enormous family--hundred of aunts, cousins, and in-laws. We have a family re-union every year--a great barbecue and picnic. I hate it. But they'd never forgive me if I didn't come. Frightened, he looked at her for a moment.",1
2147,"Laura! You're coming back, aren't you? he said quietly.",1
2148,"Yes, of course,"" she said. Be quiet. He was trembling violently; he was afraid to question her more closely.  ""Be quiet,"" she whispered, ""quiet!",1
2149,"She put her arms around him. He went with her to the station on a hot mid-afternoon. There was a smell of melted tar in the streets. She held his hand beside her in the rattling trolley, squeezing his fingers to give him comfort, and whispering from time to time:  ""In a week!",1
2150,"Only a week, dear. I don't see the need,"" he muttered. It's over 400 miles. Just for a few days. He passed the old one-legged gateman on the station platform very easily, carrying her baggage.",1
2151,"Then he sat beside her in the close green heat of the pullman until the train should go. A little electric fan droned uselessly above the aisle; a prim young lady whom he knew, arranged herself amid the bright new leather of her bags. She returned his greeting elegantly, with a shade of refined hauteur, then looked out the window again, grimacing eloquently at her parents who gazed at her raptly from the platform. Several prosperous merchants went down the aisle in expensive tan shoes that creaked under the fan's drone.",1
2152,"Not going to leave us, are you, Mr. Morris?""  ""Hello, Jim. No, I'm running up to Richmond for a few days. But even the gray weather of their lives could not deaden the excitement of that hot chariot to the East.",1
2153,"'Board! He got up trembling. In a few days, dear. She looked up, taking his hand in her small gloved palms.",1
2154,"You will write as soon as you get there? Please!""  ""Yes.  To-morrow--at once.""  He bent down suddenly and whispered, ""Laura--you will come back. You will come back! She turned her face away and wept bitterly.",1
2155,"He sat beside her once more; she clasped him tightly as if he had been a child. My dear, my dear! Don't forget me ever! Never.  Come back.",1
2156,"Come back. The salt print of her kiss was on his mouth, his face, his eyes. It was, he knew, the guttering candle-end of time. The train was in motion. He leaped blindly up the passage with a cry in his throat.",1
2157,"Come back again! But he knew. Her cry followed him, as if he had torn something from her grasp.",1
2158,"Within three days he had his letter. On four sheets of paper, bordered with victorious little American flags, this:   ""My dear: I got home at half-past one, just too tired to move. I couldn't sleep on the train at all last night, it seemed to get hotter all the way down. I was so blue when I got here, I almost cried. Little Richmond is too ghastly for words--everything burned up and every one gone away to the mountains or the sea. How can I ever stand it even for a week! (Good! he thought. If the weather holds, she will come back all the sooner.) It would be heaven now to get one breath of mountain air. Could you find your way back to our place in the valley again? (Yes, even if I were blind, he thought.) Will you promise to look after your hand until it gets well? I worried so after you had gone, because I forgot to change the bandage yesterday. Daddy was glad to see me: he said he was not going to let me go again but, don't worry, I'll have my own way in the end. I always do. I don't know any one at home any more-- all of the boys have enlisted or gone to work in the shipyards at Norfolk. Most of the girls I know are getting married, or married already. That leaves only the kids. (He winced. As old as I am, maybe older.) Give my love to Mrs. Barton, and tell your mother I said she must not work so hard in that hot kitchen. And all the little cross-marks at the bottom are for you. Try to guess what they are.  LAURA.",1
2159,"He read her prosy letter with rigid face, devouring the words more hungrily than if they had been lyrical song. She would come back! She would come back! Soon.",1
2160,"There was another page. Weakened and relaxed from his excitement, he looked at it. There he found, almost illegibly written, but at last in her own speech, as if leaping out from the careful aimlessness of her letter, this note:   ""July 4.",1
2161,"Richard came yesterday. He is twenty-five, works in Norfolk. I've been engaged to him almost a year. We're going off quietly to Norfolk to-morrow and get married. My dear! My dear! I couldn't tell you! I tried to, but couldn't. I didn't want to lie. Everything else was true. I meant all I said. If you hadn't been so young, but what's the use of saying that?  Try to forgive me, but please don't forget me. Good-by and God bless you. Oh, my darling, it was heaven! I shall never forget you. When he had finished the letter, he re-read it, slowly and carefully.",1
2162,"Then he folded it, put it in his inner breast-pocket, and leaving Dixieland, walked for forty minutes, until he came up in the gap over the town again. It was sunset. The sun's vast rim, blood-red, rested upon the western earth, in a great field of murky pollen. It sank beyond the western ranges. The clear sweet air was washed with gold and pearl. The vast hills melted into purple solitudes: they were like Canaan and rich grapes. The motors of cove people toiled up around the horse-shoe of the road. Dusk came. The bright winking lights in the town went up. Darkness melted over the town like dew: it washed out all the day's distress, the harsh confusions. Low wailing sounds came faintly up from Niggertown.",1
2163,"And above him the proud stars flashed into heaven: there was one, so rich and low, that he could have picked it, if he had climbed the hill beyond the Jew's great house. One, like a lamp, hung low above the heads of men returning home. (O Hesperus, you bring us all good things.) One had flashed out the light that winked on him the night that Ruth lay at the feet of Boaz; and one on Queen Isolt; and one on Corinth and on Troy. It was night, vast brooding night, the mother of loneliness, that washes our stains away. He was washed in the great river of night, in the Ganges tides of redemption. His bitter wound was for the moment healed in him: he turned his face upward to the proud and tender stars, which made him a god and a grain of dust, the brother of eternal beauty and the son of death--alone, alone.",1
2164,"Ha-ha-ha-ha! Helen laughed huskily, prodding him in the ribs. Your girl went and got married, didn't she? She fooled you. You got left. Wh-a-a-a-t!"" said Eliza banteringly, ""has my boy been--as the fellow says"" (she sniggered behind her hand) ""has my boy been a- courtin'?",1
2165,"She puckered her lips in playful reproach. Oh, for God's sake,"" he muttered angrily. What fellow says! His scowl broke into an angry grin as he caught his sister's eye.",1
2166,"They laughed. Well, 'Gene,"" said the girl seriously, ""forget about it. You're only a kid yet. Laura is a grown woman. Why, son,"" said Eliza with a touch of malice, ""that girl was fooling you all the time.",1
2167,"She was just leading you on. Oh, stop it, please. Cheer up!"" said Helen heartily.",1
2168,"Your time's coming. You'll forget her in a week. There are plenty more, you know. This is puppy love. Show her that you're a good sport. You ought to write her a letter of congratulation. Why, yes,"" said Eliza, ""I'd make a big joke of it all.",1
2169,"I wouldn't let on to her that it affected me. I'd write her just as big as you please and laugh about the whole thing. I'd show them! That's what I'd--""  ""Oh, for God's sake!",1
2170,"he groaned, starting up. Leave me alone, won't you?""  He left the house. But he wrote the letter. And the moment after the lid of the mailbox clanged over it, he was writhen by shame. For it was a proud and boastful letter, salted with scatterings of Greek, Latin, and English verse, quotable scraps, wrenched into the text without propriety, without accuracy, without anything but his pitiful and obvious desire to show her his weight in the point of his wit, the depth of his learning. She would be sorry when she knew her loss! But, for a moment at the end, his fiercely beating heart stormed through:  "". . .",1
2171,"and I hope he's worth having you--he can't deserve you, Laura; no one can. But if he knows what he has, that's something. How lucky he is! You're right about me--I'm too young. I'd cut off my hand now for eight or ten years more. God bless and keep you, my dear, dear Laura.",1
2172,"Something in me wants to burst. It keeps trying to, but it won't, it never has. O God! If it only would!  I shall never forget you. I'm lost now and I'll never find the way again. In God's name write me a line when you get this. Tell me what your name is now-- you never have. Tell me where you're going to live. Don't let me go entirely, I beg of you, don't leave me alone. He sent the letter to the address she had given him--to her father's house.",1
2173,"Week melted into week: his life mounted day by day in a terrible tension to the delivery of the mail, morning and afternoon, fell then into a miasmic swamp when no word came, July ended. The summer waned. She did not write.",1
2174,"Upon the darkening porch, awaiting food, the boarders rocked, oh rocked with laughter. The boarders said:  ""Eugene's lost his girl. He doesn't know what to do, he's lost his girl. Well, well!  Did the Old Boy lose his girl?""  The little fat girl, the daughter of one of the two fat sisters whose husbands were hotel clerks in Charleston, skipped to and from him, in slow May dance, with fat calves twinkling brownly above her socks.",1
2175,"Lost his girl! Lost his girl! Eugene, Eugene, has lost his girl. The fat little girl skipped back to her fat mother for approbation: they regarded each other with complacent smiles loosely netted in their full-meated mouths.",1
2176,"Don't let them kid you, big boy. What's the matter: did some one get your girl?"" asked Mr. Hake, the flour salesman. He was a dapper young man of twenty-six years, who smoked large cigars; he had a tapering face, and a high domey head, bald on top, fringed sparsely with fine blond hair. His mother, a large grass-widow near fifty, with the powerful craggy face of an Indian, a large mass of dyed yellow hair, and a coarse smile, full of gold and heartiness, rocked mightily, laughing with hoarse compassion:  ""Git another girl, 'Gene.",1
2177,"Why, law! I'd not let it bother me two minutes. He always expected her to spit, emphatically, with gusto, after speaking.",1
2178,"You should worry, boy. You should WORRY!"" said Mr. Farrel, of Miami, the dancing instructor. Women are like street-cars: if you miss one, there's another along in fifteen minutes. Ain't that right, lady? he said pertly, turning to Miss Clark, of Valdosta, Georgia, for whom it had been uttered. She answered with a throaty confused twiddle-giggle of laughter. Oh, aren't men the awfullest--""  Leaning upon the porch rail in the thickening dusk, Mr. Jake Clapp, a well-to-do widower from Old Hominy, pursued his stealthy courtship of Miss Florry Mangle, the trained nurse.",1
2179,"Her limp face made a white blot in the darkness; she spoke in a tired whine:  ""I thought she was too old for him when I saw her. 'Gene's only a kid. He's taken it hard, you can tell by looking at him how miserable he is. He's going to get sick if he keeps on at this rate. He's thin as a bone. He hardly eats a bite. People get run down like that and catch the first disease that comes along--""  Her melancholy whine continued as Jake's stealthy thigh fumbled against her.",1
2180,"She kept her arms carefully folded across her sagging breasts. In the gray darkness, the boy turned his starved face on them. His dirty clothes lapped round his scarecrow body: his eyes burned like a cat's in the dark, his hair fell over his forehead in a matted net.",1
2181,"He'll git over it,"" said Jake Clapp, in a precise country drawl, streaked with a note of bawdry. Every boy has got to go through the Calf-Love stage. When I was about 'Gene's age--""  He pressed his hard thigh gently against Florry, grinning widely and thinly with a few gold teeth. He was a tall solid man, with a hard precise face, lewdly decorous, and slanting Mongol eyes. His head was bald and knobby.",1
2182,"He'd better watch out,"" whined Florry sadly. I know what I'm talking about. That boy's not strong--he has no business to go prowling around to all hours the way he does. He's on the verge of--""  Eugene rocked gently on his feet, staring at the boarders with a steady hate.",1
2183,"Suddenly he snarled like a wild beast, and started down the porch, unable to speak, reeling, but snarling again and again his choking and insane fury. Miss Brown"" meanwhile sat primly at the end of the porch, a little apart from the others. From the dark sun-parlor at the side came swiftly the tall elegant figure of Miss Irene Mallard, twenty- eight, of Tampa, Florida. She caught him at the step edge, and pulled him round sharply, gripping his arms lightly with her cool long fingers.",1
2184,"Where are you going, 'Gene? she said quietly. Her eyes of light violet were a little tired. There was a faint exquisite perfume of rosewater.",1
2185,"Leave me alone! he muttered. You can't go on like this,"" she said in a low tone. She's not worth it--none of them are. Pull yourself together. Leave me alone!",1
2186,"he said furiously. I know what I'm doing! He wrenched away violently, and leaped down into the yard, plunging around the house in a staggering run.",1
2187,"Ben!"" said Irene Mallard sharply. Ben rose from the dark porch-swing where he had been sitting with Mrs. Pert. See if you can't do something to stop him,"" said Irene Mallard.",1
2188,"He's crazy,"" Ben muttered. Which way did he go?""  ""By there--around the house. Go quick! Ben went swiftly down the shallow steps and loped back over the lawn.",1
2189,"The yard sloped sharply down: the gaunt back of Dixieland was propped upon a dozen rotting columns of whitewashed brick, fourteen feet high. In the dim light, by one of these slender piers, already mined with crumbling ruins of wet brick, the scarecrow crouched, toiling with the thin grapevine of his arms against the temple. I will kill you, House,"" he gasped. Vile and accursed House, I will tear you down. I will bring you down upon the whores and boarders. I will wreck you, House. Another convulsion of his shoulders brought down a sprinkling rain of dust and rubble.",1
2190,"I will make you fall down on all the people in you, House,"" he said. Fool!"" cried Ben, leaping upon him, ""what are you trying to do?"" He caught the boy's arms from behind and dragged him back. Do you think you can bring her back to you by wrecking the house? Are there no other women in the world, that you should let one get the best of you like this?""  ""Let me go!",1
2191,"Let me go!"" said Eugene. What does it matter to you?""  ""Don't think, fool, that I care,"" said Ben fiercely. You're hurting no one but yourself. Do you think you'll hurt the boarders by pulling the house down on your own head? Do you think, idiot, that any one cares if you kill yourself? He shook the boy. No. No.  I don't care what you do, you know. I simply want to save the family the trouble and expense of burying you. With a great cry of rage and bafflement Eugene tried to free himself.",1
2192,"But the older brother held on as desperately as the Old Man of the Sea. Then, with a great effort of his hands and shoulders, the boy lifted his captor off the ground, and dashed him back against the white brick wall of the cellar. Ben collapsed, releasing him, with a fit of dry coughing, holding his hand against his thin breast.",1
2193,"Don't be a fool,"" he gasped. Did I hurt you?"" said Eugene dully. No.  Go into the house and wash yourself. You ought to comb your hair once or twice a week, you know. You can't go around like a wild man. Get something to eat. Have you any money?""  ""Yes--I have enough.",1
2194,"Are you all right now?""  ""Yes--don't talk about it, please.""  ""I don't want to talk about it, fool. I want you to learn a little sense,"" said Ben. He straightened, brushing his whitened coat. In a moment, he went on quietly:  ""To hell with them, 'Gene. To hell with them all. Don't let them worry you. Get all that you can. Don't give a damn for anything. Nothing gives a damn for you. To hell with it all! To hell with it! There are a lot of bad days. There are a lot of good ones. You'll forget. There are a lot of days. Let it go. Yes,"" said Eugene wearily, ""let it go.",1
2195,"It's all right now. I'm too tired. When you get tired you don't care, do you? I'm too tired to care. I'll never care any more. I'm too tired. The men in France get tired and don't care. If a man came and pointed a gun at me now, I wouldn't be scared. I'm too tired. He began to laugh, loosely, with a sense of delicious relief. I don't care for any one or anything. I've always been afraid of everything, but when I got tired I didn't care. That's how I shall get over everything. I shall get tired. Ben lighted a cigarette.",1
2196,"That's better,"" he said. Let's get something to eat. He smiled thinly. Come along, Samson. They walked out slowly around the house.",1
2197,"He washed himself, and ate a hearty meal. The boarders finished, and wandered off into the darkness variously--some to the band- concert on the Square, some to the moving-pictures, some for walks through the town. When he had fed he went out on the porch. It was dark and almost empty save where, at the side, Mrs. Selborne sat in the swing with a wealthy lumber man from Tennessee. Her low rich laughter bubbled up softly from the vat of the dark. Miss Brown"" rocked quietly and decorously by herself. She was a heavily built and quietly dressed woman of thirty-nine years, touched with that slightly comic primness--that careful gentility--that marks the conduct of the prostitute incognito. She was being very refined. She was a perfect lady and would, if aroused, assert the fact.",1
2198,"Miss Brown"" lived, she said, in Indianapolis. She was not ugly: her face was simply permeated with the implacable dullness of the Mid-Westerner. In spite of the lewdness of her wide thin mouth, her look was smug. She had a fair mass of indifferent brown hair, rather small brown eyes, and a smooth russet skin.",1
2199,"Pshaw!"" said Eliza. I don't believe her name's 'Miss Brown' any more than mine is. There had been rain.",1
2200,"The night was cool and black; the flower-bed before the house was wet, with a smell of geraniums and drenched pansies. He lighted a cigarette, sitting upon the rail. Miss Brown"" rocked.",1
2201,"It's turned off cool,"" she said. That little bit of rain has done a lot of good, hasn't it?""  ""Yes, it was hot,"" he said. I hate hot weather. I can't stand it either,"" she said.",1
2202,"That's why I go away every summer. Out my way we catch it. You folks here don't know what hot weather is. You're from Milwaukee, aren't you?""  ""Indianapolis.",1
2203,I knew it was somewhere out there. Is it a big place? he asked curiously.,1
2204,"Yes.  You could put Altamont in one corner of it and never miss it. How big is it? he said eagerly. How many people have you there?""  ""I don't know exactly--over three hundred thousand with the suburbs.",1
2205,"He reflected with greedy satisfaction. Is it pretty? Are there a lot of pretty houses and fine buildings?""  ""Yes--I think so,"" she said reflectively.",1
2206,It's a nice homelike place. What are the people like? What do they do? Are they rich? Why--yes.,1
2207,"It's a business and manufacturing place. There are a lot of rich people. I suppose they live in big houses and ride around in big cars, eh?"" he demanded.",1
2208,"Then, without waiting for a reply, he went on: ""Do they have good things to eat? What?""  She laughed awkwardly, puzzled and confused. Why, yes. There's a great deal of German cooking. Do you like German cooking?""  ""Beer!",1
2209,"he muttered lusciously. Beer--eh? You make it out there?""  ""Yes.",1
2210,"She laughed, with a voluptuous note in her voice. I believe you're a bad boy, Eugene. And what about the theatres and libraries?",1
2211,"You have lots of shows, don't you?""  ""Yes. A lot of good shows come to Indianapolis. All the big hits in New York and Chicago. And a library--you have a big one, eh?""  ""Yes.",1
2212,"We have a nice library. How many books has it?""  ""Oh, I can't say as to that. But it's a good big library. Over 100,000 books, do you suppose?",1
2213,"They wouldn't have half a million, would they? He did not wait for an answer, he was talking to himself. No, of course not. How many books can you take out at a time? What?""  The great shadow of his hunger bent over her; he rushed out of himself, devouring her with his questions.",1
2214,"What are the girls like? Are they blonde or brunette? What?""  ""Why, we have both kinds--more dark than fair, I should say.",1
2215,"She looked through the darkness at him, grinning. Are they pretty?""  ""Well!  I can't say. You'll have to draw your own conclusions, Eugene. I'm one of them, you know. She looked at him with demure lewdness, offering herself for inspection. Then, with a laugh of teasing reproof, she said:  ""I believe you're a bad boy, Eugene. I believe you're a bad boy. He lighted another cigarette feverishly.",1
2216,"I'd give anything for a smoke,"" muttered ""Miss Brown. I don't suppose I could here? She looked round her.",1
2217,Why not? he said impatiently. There's no one to see you. It's dark. What does it matter anyway? Little electric currents of excitement played up his spine.,1
2218,"I believe I will,"" she whispered. Have you got a cigarette? He gave her his package; she stood up to receive the flame he nursed in his cupped hands.",1
2219,"She leaned her heavy body against him as, with puckered face and closed eyes, she held her cigarette to the fire. She grasped his shaking hands to steady the light, holding them for a moment after. What,"" said ""Miss Brown,"" with a cunning smile, ""what if your mother should see us? You'd catch it!""  ""She'll not see us,"" he said.",1
2220,"Besides,"" he added generously, ""why shouldn't women smoke the same as men? There's no harm in it. Yes,"" said ""Miss Brown,"" ""I believe in being broad-minded about these things, too.",1
2221,"But he grinned in the dark, because the woman had revealed herself with a cigarette. It was a sign--the sign of the province, the sign unmistakable of debauchery.",1
2222,"Then, when he laid his hands upon her, she came very passively into his embrace as he sat before her on the rail. Eugene!  Eugene! she said in mocking reproof.",1
2223,"Where is your room?"" he said. She told him. Later, Eliza came suddenly and silently out upon them, on one of her swift raids from the kitchen.",1
2224,"Who's there? Who's there? she said, peering into the gloom suspiciously. Huh?  Hah? Where's Eugene? Has any one seen Eugene? She knew very well he was there.",1
2225,"Yes, here I am,"" he said. What do you want? Oh!",1
2226,"Who's that with you? Hah?""  ""'Miss Brown' is with me. Won't you come out and sit down, Mrs. Gant?"" said ""Miss Brown.",1
2227,"You must be tired and hot. Oh!"" said Eliza awkwardly, ""is that you, 'Miss Brown'? I couldn't see who it was. She switched on the dim porch light. It's mighty dark out here. Some one coming up those steps might fall and break a leg. I tell you what,"" she continued conversationally, ""this air feels good. I wish I could let everything go and just enjoy myself. She continued in amiable monologue for another half hour, her eyes probing about swiftly all the time at the two dark figures before her.",1
2228,"Then hesitantly, by awkward talkative stages, she went into the house again. Son,"" she said before she went, troubled, ""it's getting late. You'd better go to bed. That's where we all ought to be. Miss Brown"" assented gracefully and moved toward the door.",1
2229,"I'm going now. I feel tired. Good-night, all. He sat quietly on the rail, smoking, listening to the noises in the house.",1
2230,"It went to sleep. He went back and found Eliza preparing to retire to her little cell. Son! she said, in a low voice, after shaking her puckered face reproachfully for a moment, ""I tell you what--I don't like it. It doesn't look right--your sitting out alone with that woman. She's old enough to be your mother. She's YOUR boarder, isn't she?",1
2231,"he said roughly, ""not mine. I didn't bring her here. There's one thing sure,"" said Eliza, wounded.",1
2232,You don't catch me associating with them. I hold up my head as high as any one. She smiled at him bitterly.,1
2233,"Well, good-night, mama,"" he said, ashamed and hurt. Let's forget about them for a while. What does it matter?""  ""Be a good boy,"" said Eliza timidly.",1
2234,"I want you to be a good boy, son. There was a sense of guilt in her manner, a note of regret and contrition. Don't worry! he said, turning away suddenly, wrenched bitterly, as he always was, by a sense of the child-like innocence and steadfastness that lay at the bottom of her life. It's not your fault if I'm not. I shan't blame you. Goodnight. The kitchen-light went out; he heard his mother's door click gently.",1
2235,"Through the dark house a shaft of air blew coolly. Slowly, with thudding heart, he began to mount the stairs. But on that dark stair, his foot-falls numbed in the heavy carpet, he came squarely upon a woman's body that, by its fragrance, like magnolia, he knew was that of Mrs. Selborne. They held each other sharply by the arms, discovered, with caught breath. She bent toward him: a few strands of her blonde hair brushed his face, leaving it aflame.",1
2236,"Hush-h! she whispered. So they paused there, holding each other, breast to breast, the only time that they had ever touched. Then, with their dark wisdom of each other confirmed, they parted, each a sharer in the other's life, to meet thereafter before the world with calm untelling eyes.",1
2237,"He groped softly back along the dark corridor until he came to the door of ""Miss Brown's"" room. It was slightly ajar. He went in.",1
2238,"She took all his medals, all that he had won at Leonard's school-- the one for debating, the one for declaiming, the one in bronze for William Shakespeare. W. S.  1616-1916--Done for a Ducat! He had no money to give her: she did not want much--a coin or two at a time. It was, she said, not the money: it was the principle of the thing. He saw the justice of her argument.",1
2239,"For,"" said she, ""if I wanted money, I wouldn't fool with you. Somebody tries to get me to go out every day. One of the richest men in this town (old man Tyson) has been after me ever since I came. He's offered me ten dollars if I'll go out in his car with him. I don't need your money. But you've got to give me something. I don't care how little it is. I wouldn't feel decent unless you did. I'm not one of your little Society Chippies that you see every day uptown. I've too much self-respect for that.",1
2240,"So, in lieu of money, he gave her his medals as pledges. If you don't redeem them,"" said ""Miss Brown,"" ""I'll give them to my own son when I go home. Have you a son?""  ""Yes.",1
2241,"He's eighteen years old. He's almost as tall as you are and twice as broad. All the girls are mad about him. He turned his head away sharply, whitening with a sense of nausea and horror, feeling in him an incestuous pollution.",1
2242,"That's enough, now,"" said ""Miss Brown"" with authority. Go to your room and get some sleep.",1
2243,"But, unlike the first one in the tobacco town, she never called him ""son. Poor Butterfly, for her heart was break-king,       Poor Butterfly, for she loved him so-o--""   Miss Irene Mallard changed the needle of the little phonograph in the sun-parlor, and reversed the well-worn record. Then as with stately emphasis, the opening measure of ""Katinka"" paced out, she waited for him, erect, smiling, slender, beautiful, with long lovely hands held up like wings to his embrace. She was teaching him to dance. Laura James had danced beautifully: it had maddened him to see her poised in the arms of a young man dancing. Now, clumsily, he moved off on a conscientious left foot, counting to himself. One, two, three, four! Irene Mallard slipped and veered to his awkward pressure, as bodiless as a fume of smoke. Her left hand rested on his bony shoulder lightly as a bird: her cool fingers were threaded into his hot sawing palm.",1
2244,"She had thick hair of an oaken color, evenly parted in the middle; her skin was pearl-pale, and transparently delicate; her jaw was long, full, and sensuous--her face was like that of one of the pre- Raphaelite women. She carried her tall graceful body with beautiful erectness, but with the slightly worn sensuousness of fragility and weariness: her lovely eyes were violet, always a little tired, but full of slow surprise and tenderness. She was like a Luini madonna, mixed of holiness and seduction, the world and heaven. He held her with reverent care, as one who would not come too near, who would not break a sacred image. Her exquisite and subtle perfume stole through him like a strange whisper, pagan and divine. He was afraid to touch her--and his hot palm sweated to her fingers.",1
2245,"Sometimes she coughed gently, smiling, holding a small crumpled handkerchief, edged with blue, before her mouth. She had come to the hills not because of her own health, but because of her mother's, a woman of sixty-five, rustily dressed, with the petulant hang-dog face of age and sickness. The old woman suffered from asthma and heart-disease. They had come from Florida. Irene Mallard was a very capable business woman; she was the chief bookkeeper of one of the Altamont banks. Every evening Randolph Gudger, the bank president, telephoned her.",1
2246,"Irene Mallard pressed her palm across the mouthpiece of the telephone, smiling at Eugene ironically, and rolling her eyes entreatingly aloft. Sometimes Randolph Gudger drove by and asked her to go with him. The boy went sulkily away until the rich man should leave: the banker looked bitterly after him.",1
2247,"He wants me to marry him, 'Gene,"" said Irene Mallard. What am I going to do?""  ""He's old enough to be your grandfather,"" said Eugene. He has no hair on the top of his head; his teeth are false, and I don't know what-all! he said resentfully.",1
2248,"He's a rich man, 'Gene,"" said Irene, smiling. Don't forget that. Go on, then!",1
2249,Go on! he cried furiously. Yes--go ahead. Marry him. It's the right thing for you. Sell yourself. He's an old man! he said melodramatically. Randolph Gudger was almost forty- five.,1
2250,"But they danced there slowly in a gray light of dusk that was like pain and beauty; like the lost light undersea, in which his life, a lost merman, swam, remembering exile. And as they danced she, whom he dared not touch, yielded her body unto him, whispering softly to his ear, pressing with slender fingers his hot hand. And she, whom he would not touch, lay there, like a sheaf of grain, in the crook of his arm, token of the world's remedy--the refuge from the one lost face out of all the faces, the anodyne against the wound named Laura--a thousand flitting shapes of beauty to bring him comfort and delight. The great pageantry of pain and pride and death hung through the dusk its awful vision, touching his sorrow with a lonely joy. He had lost; but all pilgrimage across the world was loss: a moment of cleaving, a moment of taking away, the thousand phantom shapes that beaconed, and the high impassionate grief of stars.",1
2251,"It was dark. Irene Mallard took him by the hand and led him out on the porch. Sit down here a moment, 'Gene. I want to talk to you. Her voice was serious, low-pitched. He sat beside her in the swing, obediently, with the sense of an impending lecture.",1
2252,"I've been watching you these last few days,"" said Irene Mallard. I know what's been going on. What do you mean?",1
2253,"he said thickly, with thudding pulses. You know what I mean,"" said Irene Mallard sternly. Now you're too fine a boy, 'Gene, to waste yourself on that Woman. Any one can see what she is. Mother and I have both talked about it. A woman like that can ruin a young boy like you. You've got to stop it. How did you know about it?"" he muttered.",1
2254,"He was frightened and ashamed. She took his trembling hand and held it between her cool palms until he grew quieter. But he drew no closer to her: he halted, afraid, before her loveliness. As with Laura James, she seemed too high for his passion. He was afraid of her flesh; he was not afraid of ""Miss Brown's. But now he was tired of the woman and didn't know how he could pay her. She had all his medals.",1
2255,"All through the waning summer he walked with Irene Mallard. They walked at night through the cool streets filled with the rustle of tired leaves. They went together to the hotel roof and danced; later ""Pap"" Rheinhart, kind and awkward and shy, and smelling of his horse, came to their little table, sitting and drinking with them. He had spent the years since Leonard's at a military school, trying to straighten the wry twist of his neck. But he remained the same as ever--quizzical, dry, and humorous. Eugene looked at that good shy face, remembering the lost years, the lost faces. And there was sorrow in his heart for what would come no more. August ended.",1
2256,"September came, full of departing wings. The world was full of departures. It had heard the drums. The young men were going to the war. Ben had been rejected again in the draft. Now he was preparing to drift off in search of employment in other towns. Luke had given up his employment in a war-munitions factory at Dayton, Ohio, and had enlisted in the Navy. He had come home on a short leave before his departure for the training-school at Newport, Rhode Island. The street roared as he came down at his vulgar wide-legged stride, in flapping blues, his face all on the grin, thick curls of his unruly hair coiling below the band of his hat. He was the cartoon of a gob.",1
2257,"Luke!"" shouted Mr. Fawcett, the land-auctioneer, pulling him in from the street to Wood's pharmacy, ""by God, son, you've done your bit. I'm going to set you up. What are you going to have?""  ""Make it a dope,"" said Luke.",1
2258,"Colonel, yours truly! He lifted the frosty glass in a violently palsied hand, and stood posed before the grinning counter. F-f-f-forty years ago,"" he began, in a hoarse voice, ""I might have refused, but now I can't, G-G-G-God help me! I c-c-c-c-can't!",1
2259,Gant's sickness had returned on him with increased virulence. His face was haggard and yellow: a tottering weakness crept into his limbs. It was decided that he must go again to Baltimore. Helen would go with him.,1
2260,"Mr. Gant,"" said Eliza persuasively, ""why don't you just give up everything and settle down to take things easy the rest of your days? You don't feel good enough to tend to business any more; if I were you, I'd retire. We could get $20,000 for your shop without any trouble--If I had that much money to work with, I'd show them a thing or two. She nodded pertly with a smart wink. I could turn it over two or three times within two years' time. You've got to trade quick to keep the ball a-rolling. That's the way it's done. Merciful God,"" he groaned.",1
2261,"That's my last refuge on earth. Woman, have you no mercy? I beg of you, leave me to die in peace: it won't be long now. You can do what you please with it after I'm gone, but give me a little peace now. In the name of Jesus, I ask it! He sniffled affectedly.",1
2262,"Pshaw!"" said Eliza, thinking no doubt to encourage him. There's nothing wrong with you. Half of it's only imagination. He groaned, turning his head away.",1
2263,"Summer died upon the hills. There was a hue, barely guessed, upon the foliage, of red rust. The streets at night were filled with sad lispings: all through the night, upon his porch, as in a coma, he heard the strange noise of autumn. And all the people who had given the town its light thronging gaiety were vanished strangely overnight. They had gone back into the vast South again. The solemn tension of the war gathered about the nation. A twilight of grim effort hovered around him, above him. He felt the death of joy; but the groping within him of wonder, of glory. Out of the huge sprawl of its first delirium, the nation was beginning to articulate the engines of war--engines to mill and print out hatred and falsehood, engines to pump up glory, engines to manacle and crush opposition, engines to drill and regiment men.",1
2264,"But something of true wonder had come upon the land--the flares and rockets of the battle-fields cast their light across the plains as well. Young men from Kansas were going to die in Picardy. In some foreign earth lay the iron, as yet unmoulded, that was to slay them. The strangeness of death and destiny was legible upon lives and faces which held no strangeness of their own. For, it is the union of the ordinary and the miraculous that makes wonder.",1
2265,"Luke had gone away to the training-school at Newport. Ben went to Baltimore with Helen and Gant, who, before entering the hospital again for radium treatment, had gone on a violent and unruly spree which had compelled their rapid transference from one hotel to another and had finally brought Gant moaning to his bed, hurling against God the anathemas that should have been saved for huge riotings in raw oysters washed down chaotically with beer and whisky. They all drank a great deal: Gant's excesses, however, reduced the girl to a state of angry frenzy, and Ben to one of scowling and cursing disgust.",1
2266,"You damned old man!"" cried Helen, seizing and shaking his passive shoulders as he lay reeking and sodden on an untidy bed. I could wear you out! You're not sick; I've wasted my life nursing you, and you're not as sick as I am! You'll be here long after I'm gone, you selfish old man! It makes me furious!""  ""Why, baby!"" he roared, with a vast gesture of his arms, ""God bless you, I couldn't do without you.",1
2267,"Don't 'baby' me! she cried. But she held his hand next day as they rode out to the hospital, held it as, quaking, he turned for an instant and looked sadly at the city stretched behind and below him.",1
2268,"I was a boy here,"" he muttered. Don't worry,"" she said, ""we're going to make you well again. Why! You'll be a boy again! Hand in hand they entered the lobby where, flanked with death and terror and the busy matter-of-factness of the nurses and the hundred flitting shapes of the quiet men with the gray faces and gimlet eyes who walk so surely in among the broken lives--with arms proposed in an attitude of enormous mercy--many times bigger than Gant's largest angel--is an image of gentle Jesus.",1
2269,"Eugene went to see the Leonards several times. Margaret looked thin and ill, but the great light in her seemed on this account to burn more brightly. Never before had he been so aware of her enormous tranquil patience, the great health of her spirit. All of his sin, all of his pain, all the vexed weariness of his soul were washed away in that deep radiance: the tumult and evil of life dropped from him its foul and ragged cloak. He seemed to be clothed anew in garments of seamless light.",1
2270,"But he could confess little that lay on his heart: he talked freely of his work at the university, he talked of little else. His heart was packed with its burden for confessional, but he knew he could not speak, that she would not understand. She was too wise for anything but faith. Once, desperately, he tried to tell her of Laura: he blurted out a confession awkwardly in a few words. Before he had finished she began to laugh.",1
2271,"Mr. Leonard! she called. Imagine this rascal with a girl! Pshaw, boy! You don't know what love is. Get along with you. There'll be time enough to think of that ten years from now. She laughed tenderly to herself, with absent misty gaze.",1
2272,"Old 'Gene with a girl! Pity the poor girl! Ah, Lord, Boy! That's a long way off for you. Thank your stars!",1
2273,"He bent his head sharply, and closed his eyes. O My lovely Saint! he thought. How close you have been to me, if any one. How I have cut my brain open for you to see, and would my heart, if I had dared, and how alone I am, and always have been.",1
2274,"He walked through the streets at night with Irene Mallard; the town was thinned and saddened by departures. A few people hurried past, as if driven along by the brief pouncing gusts of wind. He was held in the lure of her subtle weariness: she gave him comfort and he never touched her. But he unpacked the burden of his heart, trembling and passionate. She sat beside him and stroked his hand. It seemed to him that he never knew her until he remembered her years later.",1
2275,"The house was almost empty. At night Eliza packed his trunk carefully, counting the ironed shirts and mended socks with satisfaction. Now, you have plenty of good warm clothes, son. Try to take care of them. She put Gant's check in his inner pocket and fastened it with a safety-pin.",1
2276,"Keep a sharp eye on your money, boy. You never know who you'll run up with on a train. He dawdled nervously toward the door, wishing to melt away, not end in leave-taking.",1
2277,"It does seem you might spend one night at home with your mother,"" she said querulously. Her eyes grew misty at once, her lips began to work tremulously in a bitter self-pitying smile. I tell you what! It looks mighty funny, doesn't it? You can't stay with me five minutes any more without wanting to be up and off with the first woman that comes along. It's all right! It's all right. I'm not complaining. It seems as if all I was fit for is to cook and sew and get you ready to go off. She burst volubly into tears. It seems that that's the only use you have for me. I've hardly laid eyes on you all summer. No,"" he said bitterly, ""you've been too busy looking after the boarders.",1
2278,"Don't think, mama, that you can work on my feelings here at the last minute,"" he cried, already deeply worked-on. It's easy to cry. But I was here all the time if you had had time for me. Oh, for God's sake! Let's make an end to this! Aren't things bad enough without it? Why must you act this way whenever I go off? Do you want to make me as miserable as you can?""  ""Well, I tell you,"" said Eliza hopefully, becoming dry-eyed at once, ""if I make a couple of deals and everything goes well, you may find me waiting for you in a big fine house when you come back next Spring.",1
2279,"I've got the lot picked out. I was thinking about it the other day,"" she went on, giving him a bright and knowing nod. Ah-h! he made a strangling noise in his throat and tore at his collar. In God's name! Please! There was a silence.",1
2280,"Well,"" said Eliza gravely, plucking at her chin, ""I want you to be a good boy and study hard, son. Take care of your money--I want you to have plenty of good food and warm clothes--but you mustn't be extravagant, boy. This sickness of your papa's has cost a lot of money. Everything is going out and nothing's coming in. Nobody knows where the next dollar's coming from. So you've got to watch out. Again silence fell.",1
2281,"She had said her say; she had come as close as she could, but suddenly she felt speechless, shut out, barred from the bitter and lonely secrecy of his life. I hate to see you go, son,"" she said quietly, with a deep and indefinable sadness. He cast his arms up suddenly in a tortured incomplete gesture.",1
2282,"What does it matter! Oh God, what does it matter!""  Eliza's eyes filled with tears of real pain. She grasped his hand and held it.",1
2283,"Try to be happy, son,"" she wept, ""try to be a little more happy. Poor child! Poor child! Nobody ever knew you. Before you were born,"" she shook her head slowly, speaking in a voice that was drowned and husky with her tears. Then, huskily, clearing her throat, she repeated, ""Before you were born--""    32   When he returned to the university for his second year, he found the place adjusted soberly to war.",1
2284,"It seemed quieter, sadder--the number of students was smaller and they were younger. The older ones had gone to war. The others were in a state of wild, but subdued, restlessness. They were careless of colleges, careers, successes--the war had thrilled them with its triumphing Now. Of what use To-morrow! Of what use all labor for To-morrow! The big guns had blown all spun schemes to fragments: they hailed the end of all planned work with a fierce, a secret joy. The business of education went on half-heartedly, with an abstracted look: in the classroom, their eyes were vague upon the book, but their ears cocked attentively for alarums and excursions without.",1
2285,"Eugene began the year earnestly as room-mate of a young man who had been the best student in the Altamont High School. His name was Bob Sterling. Bob Sterling was nineteen years old, the son of a widow. He was of middling height, always very neatly and soberly dressed; there was nothing conspicuous about him. For this reason, he could laugh good-naturedly, a little smugly, at whatever was conspicuous. He had a good mind--bright, attentive, studious, unmarked by originality or inventiveness. He had a time for everything: he apportioned a certain time for the preparation of each lesson, and went over it three times, mumbling rapidly to himself. He sent his laundry out every Monday. When in merry company he laughed heartily and enjoyed himself, but he always kept track of the time. Presently, he would look at his watch, saying: ""Well, this is all very nice, but it's getting no work done,"" and he would go.",1
2286,"Every one said he had a bright future. He remonstrated with Eugene, with good-natured seriousness, about his habits. He ought not to throw his clothes around. He ought not to let his shirts and drawers accumulate in a dirty pile. He ought to have a regular time for doing each lesson; he ought to live by regular hours.",1
2287,"They lived in a private dwelling on the edge of the campus, in a large bright room decorated with a great number of college pennants, all of which belonged to Bob Sterling. Bob Sterling had heart-disease. He stood on the landing, gasping, when he had climbed the stairs. Eugene opened the door for him. Bob Sterling's pleasant face was dead white, spotted by pale freckles. His lips chattered and turned blue.",1
2288,"What is it, Bob? How do you feel?"" said Eugene. Come here,"" said Bob Sterling with a grin. Put your head down here. He took Eugene's head and placed it against his heart. The great pump beat slowly and irregularly, with a hissing respiration.",1
2289,"Good God!"" cried Eugene. Do you hear it?"" said Bob Sterling, beginning to laugh. Then he went into the room, chafing his dry hands briskly.",1
2290,"But he fell sick and could not attend classes. He was taken to the College Infirmary, where he lay for several weeks, apparently not very ill, but with lips constantly blue, a slow pulse, and a sub- normal temperature. Nothing could be done about it.",1
2291,"His mother came and took him home. Eugene wrote him regularly twice a week, getting in return short but cheerful messages. Then one day he died.",1
2292,Two weeks later the widow returned to gather together the boy's belongings. Silently she collected the clothing that no one would ever wear. She was a stout woman in her forties. Eugene took all the pennants from the wall and folded them. She packed them in a valise and turned to go.,1
2293,"Here's another,"" said Eugene. She burst suddenly into tears and seized his hand. He was so brave,"" she said, ""so brave. Those last days--I had not meant to--Your letters made him so happy. She's alone now, Eugene thought.",1
2294,"I cannot stay here, he thought, where he has been. We were here together. Always I should see him on the landing, with the hissing valve and the blue lips, or hear him mumbling his lessons. Then, at night, the other cot would be empty. I think I shall room alone hereafter.",1
2295,"But he roomed the remainder of the term in one of the dormitories. He had two room-mates--one, an Altamont young man who answered to the name of L. K. Duncan (the ""L"" stood for Lawrence, but every one called him ""Elk"") and the other, the son of an Episcopal minister, Harold Gay. Both were several years older than Eugene: Elk Duncan was twenty-four, and Harold Gay, twenty-two. But it is doubtful whether a more precious congress of freaks had ever before gathered in two small rooms, one of which they used as a ""study. Elk Duncan was the son of an Altamont attorney, a small Democratic politician, mighty in county affairs.",1
2296,"Elk Duncan was tall--an inch or two over six feet--and incredibly thin, or rather narrow. He was already a little bald, he had a high prominent forehead, and large pale bulging eyes: from that point his long pale face sloped backward to his chin. His shoulders were a trifle bowed and very narrow; the rest of his body had the symmetry of a lead pencil. He always dressed very foppishly, in tight suits of blue flannel, with high stiff collars, fat silken cravats, and colored silk handkerchiefs. He was a student in the Law School, but he spent a large part of his time, industriously, in avoiding study.",1
2297,"The younger students--particularly the Freshmen--gathered around him after meals with mouths slightly ajar, feeding upon his words like manna, and hungrily demanding more, the wilder his fable became. His posture toward life was very much that of the barker of a carnival sideshow: loquacious, patronizing, and cynical. The other room-mate, Harold Gay, was a good soul, no older than a child. He wore spectacles, which gave the only glister to the dull grayness of his face; he was plain and ugly without any distinction: he had been puzzled so long by at least four-fifths of the phenomena of existence that he no longer made any effort to comprehend them. Instead, he concealed his shyness and bewilderment under a braying laugh that echoed at all the wrong places, and a silly grin full of an absurd and devilish knowingness. His association with Elk Duncan was one of the proud summits of his life: he weltered in the purple calcium which bathed that worthy, he smoked cigarettes with a debauched leer, and cursed loudly and uneasily with the accent of a depraved clergyman.",1
2298,"Harold!  Harold!"" said Elk Duncan reprovingly. Damn, son! You're getting hard! If you go on like this, you'll begin to chew gum, and fritter away your Sunday-school money at the movies. Think of the rest of us, please. 'Gene here's only a young boy, as pure as a barnyard privy, and, as for me, I've always moved in the best circles, and associated with only the highest class of bartenders and ladylike streetwalkers. What would your father say if he could hear you? Don't you know he'd be shocked? He'd cut off your cigarette money, son. I don't give a damn what he'd do, Elk, nor you either!"" said Harold toughly, grinning.",1
2299,"So, what the hell! he roared as loudly as he could. There was an answering howl from the windows of the whole dormitory--cries of ""Go to hell! Cut it out! and ironical cheers, at which he was pleased.",1
2300,"The scattered family drew together again at Christmas. A sense of impending dissolution, of loss and death, brought them back. The surgeon at Baltimore had given no hope. He had, rather, confirmed Gant's death-warrant.",1
2301,"Then how long can he live?"" asked Helen. He shrugged his shoulders. My dear girl! he said. I have no idea. The man's a miracle. Do you know that he's Exhibit A here? Every surgeon in the place has had a look. How long can he last? I'll swear to nothing--I no longer have any idea. When your father left here, the first time, after his operation, I never expected to see him again. I doubted if he would last the winter through. But he's back again. He may be back many times. Can you help him at all?",1
2302,"Do you think the radium does any good?""  ""I can give him relief for a time. I can even check the growth of the disease for a time. Beyond that, I can do nothing. But his vitality is enormous. He is a creaking gate which hangs by one hinge--but which hangs, nevertheless.",1
2303,"Thus, she had brought him home, the shadow of his death suspended over them like a Damocles sword. Fear prowled softly through their brains on leopard feet. The girl lived in a condition of repressed hysteria: it had its outburst daily at Eliza's or in her own home. Hugh Barton had purchased a house to which he had taken her.",1
2304,"You'll get no peace,"" he said, ""as long as you're near them. That's what's wrong with you now. She had frequent periods of sickness.",1
2305,"She went constantly to the doctors for treatment and advice. Sometimes she went to the hospital for several days. Her illness manifested itself in various ways--sometimes in a terrible mastoid pain, sometimes in nervous exhaustion, sometimes in an hysterical collapse in which she laughed and wept by turns, and which was governed partly by Gant's illness and a morbid despair over her failure to bear a child. She drank stealthily at all times--she drank in nibbling draughts for stimulants, never enough for drunkenness. She drank vile liquids--seeking only the effect of alcohol and getting at it in strange ways through a dozen abominations called ""tonics"" and ""extracts. Almost deliberately she ruined her taste for the better sort of potable liquors, concealing from herself, under the convenient labellings of physic, the ugly crawling hunger in her blood. This self-deception was characteristic of her. Her life expressed itself through a series of deceptions--of symbols: her dislikes, affections, grievances, brandishing every cause but the real one.",1
2306,"But, unless actually bedridden, she was never absent from her father for many hours. The shadow of his death lay over their lives. They shuddered below its horror; its protracted menace, its unsearchable enigma, deprived them of dignity and courage. They were dominated by the weary and degrading egotism of life, which is blandly philosophical over the death of the alien, but sees in its own the corruption of natural law. It was as hard for them to think of Gant's death as of God's death: it was a great deal harder, because he was more real to them than God, he was more immortal than God, he was God.",1
2307,"This hideous twilight into which their lives had passed froze Eugene with its terror, and choked him with fury. He would grow enraged after reading a letter from home and pound the grained plaster of the dormitory wall until his knuckles were bloody. They have taken his courage away! he thought. They have made a whining coward out of him! No, and if I die, no damned family about. Blowing their messy breaths in your face! Snuffling down their messy noses at you! Gathering around you till you can't breathe. Telling you how well you're looking with hearty smiles, and boo- hooing behind your back. O messy, messy, messy death! Shall we never be alone? Shall we never live alone, think alone, live in a house by ourselves alone? Ah! but I shall! I shall! Alone, alone, and far away, with falling rain. Then, bursting suddenly into the study, he found Elk Duncan, with unaccustomed eye bent dully upon a page of Torts, a bright bird held by the stare of that hypnotic snake, the law.",1
2308,"Are we to die like rats?"" he said. Are we to smother in a hole? Damn!"" said Elk Duncan, folding the big calfskin and cowering defensively behind it.",1
2309,"Yes, that's right, that's right! Calm yourself. You are Napoleon Bonaparte and I'm your old friend, Oliver Cromwell. Harold! he called. Help! He killed the keeper and got out. 'Gene!",1
2310,"yelled Harold Gay, hurling a thick volume from him under the spell of Elk's great names. What do you know about history? Who signed Magna Charta, eh?""  ""It wasn't signed,"" said Eugene.",1
2311,"The King didn't know how to write, so they mimeographed it. Correct!"" roared Harold Gay. Who was Æthelred the Unready?""  ""He was the son of Cynewulf the Silly and Undine the Unwashed,"" said Eugene.",1
2312,"On his Uncle Jasper's side,"" said Elk Duncan, ""he was related to Paul the Poxy and Genevieve the Ungenerous. He was excommunicated by the Pope in a Bull of the year 903, but he refused to be cowed,"" said Eugene. Instead, he called together all the local clergy, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Gay, who was elected Pope,"" said Elk Duncan. This caused a great schism in the Church. But as usual, God was on the side of the greatest number of canons,"" said Eugene.",1
2313,"Later on, the family migrated to California, and made its fortune in the Gold Rush of '49. You boys are too good for me! yelled Harold Gay, getting up abruptly. Come on! Who's going to the Pic?""  The Pic was the only purchasable entertainment that the village afforded steadily.",1
2314,"It was a moving-picture theatre, inhabited nightly by a howling tribe of students who rushed down aisles, paved with peanut-shells, through a shrapnel fire of flying goobers, devoting themselves studiously for the remainder of the evening to the unhappy heads and necks of Freshmen, and less attentively, but with roars of applause, indignation, or advice, to the poor flicker-dance of puppets that wavered its way illegibly across the worn and pleated screen. A weary but industrious young woman with a scrawny neck thumped almost constantly at a battered piano. If she was idle for five minutes, the whole pack howled ironically, demanding:  ""Music, Myrtle! Music!",1
2315,"It was necessary to speak to every one. If one spoke to every one, one was ""democratic""; if one did not, one was a snob, and got few votes. The appraisal of personality, like all other appraisal with them, was coarse and blunt. They were suspicious of all eminence. They had a hard peasant hostility to the unusual. A man was brilliant? Was there a bright sparkle to him? Bad, bad! He was not safe; he was not sound. The place was a democratic microcosmos--seething with political interests: national, regional, collegiate.",1
2316,"The campus had its candidates, its managers, its bosses, its machines, as had the State. A youngster developed in college the political craft he was later to exert in Party affairs. The son of a politician was schooled by his crafty sire before the down was off his cheeks: at sixteen, his life had been plotted ahead to the governorship, or to the proud dignities of a Congressman. The boy came deliberately to the university to bait and set his first traps: deliberately he made those friendships that were most likely to benefit him later. By his junior year, if he was successful, he had a political manager, who engineered his campus ambitions; he moved with circumspection, and spoke with a trace of pomp nicely weighed with cordiality:",1
2317,"Ah, there, gentlemen.""  ""Gentlemen, how are you? A nice day, gentlemen. The vast champaign of the world stretched out its limitless wonder, but few were seduced away from the fortress of the State, few ever heard the distant reverberation of an idea.",1
2318,"They could get no greater glory for themselves than a seat in the Senate, and the way to glory--the way to all power, highness, and distinction whatsoever--was through the law, a string tie, and a hat. Hence politics, law schools, debating societies, and speechmaking. The applause of listening senates to command.",1
2319,"The yokels, of course, were in the saddle--they composed nine- tenths of the student body: the proud titles were in their gift, and they took good care that their world should be kept safe for yokelry and the homespun virtues. Usually, these dignities--the presidencies of student bodies, classes, Y.M.C.A.'s, and the managerships of athletic teams--were given to some honest serf who had established his greatness behind a plough before working in the college commons, or to some industrious hack who had shown a satisfactory mediocrity in all directions. Such an industrious hack was called an ""all-round man. He was safe, sound, and reliable. He would never get notions. He was the fine flower of university training. He was a football scrub, and a respectable scholar in all subjects. He was a universal Two Man. He always got Two on everything, except Moral Character, where he shone with a superlative Oneness. If he did not go into the law or the ministry, he was appointed a Rhodes Scholar.",1
2320,"In this strange place Eugene flourished amazingly. He was outside the pale of popular jealousies: it was quite obvious that he was not safe, that he was not sound, that decidedly he was an irregular person. He could never be an all-round man. Obviously, he would never be governor. Obviously, he would never be a politician, because he said funny things. He was not the man to lead a class or say a prayer; he was a man for curious enterprise. Well, thought they benevolently, we need some such. We are not all made for weighty business.",1
2321,"He was happier than he had ever been in his life, and more careless. His physical loneliness was more complete and more delightful. His escape from the bleak horror of disease and hysteria and death impending, that hung above his crouched family, left him with a sense of aerial buoyance, drunken freedom. He had come to the place alone, without companions. He had no connections. He had, even now, not one close friend. And this isolation was in his favor. Every one knew him at sight: every one called him by name, and spoke to him kindly. He was not disliked. He was happy, full of expansive joy, he greeted every one with enthusiastic gusto. He had a vast tenderness, an affection for the whole marvellous and unvisited earth, that blinded his eyes. He was closer to a feeling of brotherhood than he had ever been, and more alone. He was filled with a divine indifference for all appearance. Joy ran like a great wine through his young expanding limbs; he bounded down the paths with wild cries in his throat, leaping for life like an apple, trying to focus the blind desire that swept him apart, to melt down to a bullet all of his formless passion, and so, slay death, slay love.",1
2322,"He began to join. He joined everything. He had never ""belonged"" to any group before, but now all groups were beckoning him. He had without much trouble won a place for himself on the staff of the college paper and the magazine. The small beginning trickle of distinctions widened into a gushet. It began to sprinkle, then it rained. He was initiated into literary fraternities, dramatic fraternities, theatrical fraternities, speaking fraternities, journalistic fraternities, and in the Spring into a social fraternity. He joined enthusiastically, submitted with fanatical glee to the hard mauling of the initiations, and went about lame and sore, more pleased than a child or a savage, with colored ribbons in his coat lapel, and a waistcoat plastered with pins, badges, symbols, and Greek letterings.",1
2323,"But not without labor had his titles come. The early autumn was lustreless and slack: he could not come from the shadow of Laura. She haunted him. When he went home at Christmas, he found the hills bleak and close, and the town mean and cramped in the grim stinginess of winter. There was a ludicrous, a desperate gaiety in the family.",1
2324,"Well!"" said Eliza sorrowfully, as she peered above the stove, ""let's all try to be happy this time and enjoy a quiet Christmas. You never know! She shook her head, unable to continue. Her eyes were wet. It may be the last time we're all together. The old trouble! The old trouble! she said hoarsely, turning to him.",1
2325,"What old trouble?"" he said angrily. Good God, why are you so mysterious?""  ""My heart! she whispered, with a brave smile. I've said nothing to any one. But last week--I thought I was gone. This was delivered in a boding whisper.",1
2326,"Oh, my God!"" he groaned. You'll be here when the rest of us are rotten. Helen burst into a raucous angry laugh, looking at his sullen face, and prodding him roughly with her big fingers.",1
2327,"K-K-K-K-K-K-K! Did you ever know it to fail? Did you? If you come to her with one of your kidneys gone, she's always got something worse the matter with her. No, sir! I've never known it to fail! You may laugh!",1
2328,"You may laugh! said Eliza with a smile of watery bitterness. But I may not be here to laugh at much longer. Good heavens, mama!",1
2329,"the girl cried irritably. There's nothing wrong with you. You're not the sick one! Papa's the sick one. He's the one that needs attention. Can't you realize that--he's dying. He may not last the winter out. I'm the sick one! You'll be here long after we're both gone. You never know,"" said Eliza mysteriously.",1
2330,"You never know who'll be the first one to go. Only last week, there was Mr. Cosgrave, as fine a looking man as--""  ""They're off! Eugene screamed with a crazy laugh, stamping up and down the kitchen in a frenzy. By God! They're off! At this moment, one of the aged harpies, of whom the house always sheltered two or three during the grim winter, lurched from the hall back into the door-space.",1
2331,"She was a large raw-boned hag, a confirmed drug-eater, who moved by a violent and dissonant jerking of her gaunt limbs, pawing abruptly at the air with a gnarled hand. Mrs. Gant,"" said she, writhing her loose gray lips horribly before she could speak. Did I get a letter? Have you seen him?""  ""Seen who?",1
2332,"Go on!"" said Eliza fretfully. I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't believe you do, either.""  Smiling hideously at them all, and pawing the air, the monster got under way again, disappearing like an old wagon with loose wheels. Helen began to laugh, hoarsely, as Eugene's face hung forward with mouth half-open in an expression of sullen stupefaction. Eliza laughed, too, slily, rubbing her nosewing with a finger.",1
2333,"I'll vow! she said. I believe she's crazy. She takes dope of some sort--that's certain. It makes my flesh crawl when she comes around. Then why do you keep her in the house?"" said Helen resentfully.",1
2334,"Good heavens, mama! You could get rid of her if you wanted to. Poor old 'Gene! she said, beginning to laugh again. You always catch it, don't you?""  ""The time draws near the birth of Christ,"" said he, piously.",1
2335,"She laughed; then, with abstracted eyes, plucked vaguely at her large chin. His father spent most of the day staring vacantly into the parlor fire. Miss Florry Mangle, the nurse, gave him the morbid comfort of her silence: she rocked incessantly before the fire, thirty heel-taps to the minute, with arms tight-folded on her limp breasts. Occasionally she talked of death and disease. Gant had aged and wasted shockingly. His heavy clothes wound round his feeble shanks: his face was waxen and transparent--it was like a great beak. He looked clean and fragile. The cancer, Eugene thought, flowered in him like some terrible but beautiful plant. His mind was very clear, not doting, but sad and old. He spoke little, with almost comical gentleness, but he ceased to listen almost as soon as one answered.",1
2336,"How have you been, son?"" he asked. Are you getting along all right?""  ""Yes.  I am a reporter on the paper now; I may be managing editor next year. I have been elected to several organizations,"" he went on eagerly, glad of the rare chance to speak to one of them about his life. But when he looked up again, his father's stare was fixed sadly in the fire. The boy stopped in confusion, pierced with a bitter pain.",1
2337,"That's good,"" said Gant, hearing him speak no more. Be a good boy, son. We're proud of you. Ben came home two days before Christmas: he prowled through the house like a familiar ghost.",1
2338,"He had left the town early in the autumn, after his return from Baltimore. For three months he had wandered alone through the South, selling to the merchants in small towns space for advertisements upon laundry cards. How well this curious business succeeded he did not say: he was scrupulously neat, but threadbare and haggard, and more fiercely secretive than ever. He had found employment at length upon a newspaper in a rich tobacco town of the Piedmont. He was going there after Christmas.",1
2339,"He had come to them, as always, bearing gifts. Luke came in from the naval school at Newport, on Christmas eve. They heard his sonorous tenor shouting greetings to people in the street; he entered the house upon a blast of air. Everyone began to grin.",1
2340,"Well, here we are! The Admiral's back! Papa, how's the boy! Well, for God's sake! he cried, embracing Gant, and slapping his back. I thought I was coming to see a sick man! You're looking like the flowers that bloom in the Spring. Pretty well, my boy.",1
2341,"How are you?"" said Gant, with a pleased grin. Couldn't be better, Colonel 'Gene, how are you, Old Scout?  Good!"" he said, without waiting for an answer. Well, well, if it isn't Old Baldy,"" he cried, pumping Ben's hand. I didn't know whether you'd be here or not. Mama, old girl,"" he said, as he embraced her, ""how're they going? Still hitting on all six.  Fine! he yelled, before any one could reply to anything.",1
2342,"Why, son,--what on earth!"" cried Eliza, stepping back to look at him. What have you done to yourself? You walk as if you are lame. He laughed idiotically at sight of her troubled face and prodded her.",1
2343,"Whah--whah! I got torpedoed by a submarine,"" he said. Oh, it's nothing,"" he added modestly. I gave a little skin to help out a fellow in the electrical school. What!",1
2344,"Eliza screamed. How much did you give?""  ""Oh, only a little six-inch strip,"" he said carelessly. The boy was badly burned: a bunch of us got together and chipped in with a little hide. Mercy!"" said Eliza.",1
2345,"You'll be lame for life. It's a wonder you can walk. He always thinks of others--that boy!"" said Gant proudly.",1
2346,"He'd give you his heart's-blood. The sailor had secured an extra valise, and stocked it on the way home with a great variety of beverages for his father. There were several bottles of Scotch and rye whiskies, two of gin, one of rum, and one each of port and sherry wine.",1
2347,"Every one grew mildly convivial before the evening meal. Let's give the poor kid a drink,"" said Helen. It won't hurt him. What!",1
2348,"My ba-a-by! Why, son, you wouldn't drink, would you?"" Eliza said playfully. Wouldn't he!"" said Helen, prodding him. Ho! ho! ho! She poured him out a stiff draught of Scotch whiskey.",1
2349,"There! she said cheerfully. That's not going to hurt him. Son,"" said Eliza gravely, balancing her wine-glass, ""I don't want you ever to acquire a taste for it.",1
2350,"She was still loyal to the doctrine of the good Major. No,"" said Gant. It'll ruin you quicker than anything in the world, if you do. You're a goner, boy, if that stuff ever gets you,"" said Luke.",1
2351,"Take a fool's advice. They lavished fair warnings on him as he lifted his glass. He choked as the fiery stuff caught in his young throat, stopping his breath for a moment and making him tearful. He had drunk a few times before--minute quantities that his sister had given him at Woodson Street. Once, with Jim Trivett, he had fancied himself tipsy.",1
2352,"When they had eaten, they drank again. He was allowed a small one. Then they all departed for town to complete their belated shopping. He was left alone in the house.",1
2353,"What he had drunk beat pleasantly through his veins in warm pulses, bathing the tips of ragged nerves, giving to him a feeling of power and tranquillity he had never known. Presently, he went to the pantry where the liquor was stored. He took a water tumbler and filled it experimentally with equal portions of whiskey, gin, and rum. Then, seating himself at the kitchen table, he began to drink the mixture slowly.",1
2354,"The terrible draught smote him with the speed and power of a man's fist. He was made instantly drunken, and he knew instantly why men drank. It was, he knew, one of the great moments in his life--he lay, greedily watching the mastery of the grape over his virgin flesh, like a girl for the first time in the embrace of her lover. And suddenly, he knew how completely he was his father's son--how completely, and with what added power and exquisite refinement of sensation, was he Gantian. He exulted in the great length of his limbs and his body, through which the mighty liquor could better work its wizardry. In all the earth there was no other like him, no other fitted to be so sublimely and magnificently drunken. It was greater than all the music he had ever heard; it was as great as the highest poetry. Why had he never been told? Why had no one ever written adequately about it? Why, when it was possible to buy a god in a bottle, and drink him off, and become a god oneself, were men not forever drunken?",1
2355,"He had a moment of great wonder--the magnificent wonder with which we discover the simple and unspeakable things that lie buried and known, but unconfessed, in us. So might a man feel if he wakened after death and found himself in Heaven. Then a divine paralysis crept through his flesh. His limbs were numb; his tongue thickened until he could not bend it to the cunning sounds of words. He spoke aloud, repeating difficult phrases over and over, filled with wild laughter and delight at his effort. Behind his drunken body his brain hung poised like a falcon, looking on him with scorn, with tenderness, looking on all laughter with grief and pity. There lay in him something that could not be seen and could not be touched, which was above and beyond him--an eye within an eye, a brain above a brain, the Stranger that dwelt in him and regarded him and was him, and that he did not know. But, thought he, I am alone now in this house; if I can come to know him, I will.",1
2356,"He got up, and reeled out of the alien presences of light and warmth in the kitchen; he went out into the hall where a dim light burned and the high walls gave back their grave-damp chill. This, he thought, is the house. He sat down upon the hard mission settle, and listened to the cold drip of silence. This is the house in which I have been an exile. There is a stranger in the house, and there's a stranger in me.",1
2357,"O house of Admetus, in whom (although I was a god) I have endured so many things. Now, house, I am not afraid. No ghost need fear come by me. If there's a door in silence, let it open. My silence can be greater than your own. And you who are in me, and who I am, come forth beyond this quiet shell of flesh that makes no posture to deny you. There is none to look at us: O come, my brother and my lord, with unbent face. If I had 40,000 years, I should give all but the ninety last to silence. I should grow to the earth like a hill or a rock. Unweave the fabric of nights and days; unwind my life back to my birth; subtract me into nakedness again, and build me back with all the sums I have not counted. Or let me look upon the living face of darkness; let me hear the terrible sentence of your voice.",1
2358,"There was nothing but the living silence of the house: no doors were opened. Presently, he got up and left the house. He wore no hat or coat; he could not find them. The night was blanketed in a thick steam of mist: sounds came faintly and cheerfully. Already the earth was full of Christmas. He remembered that he had bought no gifts. He had a few dollars in his pocket; before the shops closed he must get presents for the family. Bareheaded he set off for the town. He knew that he was drunk and that he staggered; but he believed that with care and control he could hide his state from any one who saw him. He straddled the line that ran down the middle of the concrete sidewalk, keeping his eyes fixed on it and coming back to it quickly when he lurched away from it. When he got into the town the streets were thronged with late shoppers. An air of completion was on everything. The people were streaming home to Christmas. He plunged down from the Square into the narrow avenue, going in among the staring passersby. He kept his eye hotly on the line before him. He did not know where to go. He did not know what to buy.",1
2359,"As he reached the entrance to Wood's pharmacy, a shout of laughter went up from the lounging beaux. The next instant he was staring into the friendly grinning faces of Julius Arthur and Van Yeats. Where the hell do you think you're going?"" said Julius Arthur.",1
2360,"He tried to explain; a thick jargon broke from his lips. He's cock-eyed drunk,"" said Van Yeats. You look out for him, Van,"" said Julius. Get him in a doorway, so none of his folks will see him. I'll get the car. Van Yeats propped him carefully against the wall; Julius Arthur ran swiftly into Church Street, and drew up in a moment at the curb.",1
2361,Eugene had a vast inclination to slump carelessly upon the nearest support. He placed his arms around their shoulders and collapsed. They wedged him between them on the front seat; somewhere bells were ringing.,1
2362,"Ding-dong! he said, very cheerfully. Cris-muss! They answered with a wild yell of laughter.",1
2363,"The house was still empty when they came to it. They got him out of the car, and staggered up the steps with him. He was sorry enough that their fellowship was broken.",1
2364,"Where's your room, 'Gene?"" said Julius Arthur, panting, as they entered the hall. This one's as good as any,"" said Van Yeats. The door of the front bed-room, opposite the parlor, was open. They took him in and put him on the bed.",1
2365,"Let's take off his shoes,"" said Julius Arthur. They unlaced them and pulled them off. Is there anything else you want, son?"" said Julius.",1
2366,"He tried to tell them to undress him, put him below the covers, and close the door, in order to conceal his defection from his family, but he had lost the power of speech. After looking and grinning at him for a moment, they went out without closing the door. When they had gone he lay upon the bed, unable to move. He had no sense of time, but his mind worked very clearly. He knew that he should rise, fasten the door, and undress. But he was paralyzed.",1
2367,"Presently the Gants came home. Eliza alone was still in town, pondering over gifts. It was after eleven o'clock. Gant, his daughter, and his two sons came into the room and stared at him. When they spoke to him, he burned helplessly.",1
2368,"Speak!  Speak! yelled Luke, rushing at him and choking him vigorously. Are you dumb, idiot?""  I shall remember that, he thought.",1
2369,"Have you no pride? Have you no honor? Has it come to this? the sailor roared dramatically, striding around the room.",1
2370,"Doesn't he think he's hell, though? Eugene thought. He could not fashion words, but he could make sounds, ironically, in the rhythm of his brother's moralizing. Tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh! Tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh! Tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh! he said, with accurate mimicry. Helen, loosening his collar, bent over him laughing. Ben grinned swiftly under a cleft scowl.",1
2371,"Have you no this? Have you no that? Have you no this? Have you no that?--he was cradled in their rhythm. No, ma'am. We've run out of honor to-day, but we have a nice fresh lot of self-respect.",1
2372,"Ah, be quiet,"" Ben muttered. No one's dead, you know. Go heat some water,"" said Gant professionally, ""he's got to get it off his stomach.",1
2373,"He no longer seemed old. His life in a marvellous instant came from its wasting shadow; it took on a hale sinew of health and action. Save the fireworks,"" said Helen to Luke, as she left the room. Close the door. For heaven's sake, try to keep it from mama, if you can. This is a great moral issue, thought Eugene.",1
2374,"He began to feel sick. Helen returned in a very few minutes with a kettle of hot water, a glass, and a box of soda. Gant fed him the solution mercilessly until he began to vomit. At the summit of his convulsion Eliza appeared. He lifted his sick head dumbly from the bowl, and saw her white face at the door, and her weak brown eyes, that could take on so much sharpness and sparkle when her suspicion was awakened.",1
2375,"Hah?  Huh? What is it?"" said Eliza. But she knew, of course, instantly, what it was.",1
2376,"What say? she asked sharply. No one had said anything. He grinned feebly at her, tickled, above his nausea and grief, at the palpable assumption of blind innocence which always heralded her discoveries. Seeing her thus, they all laughed.",1
2377,"Oh, my Lord!"" said Helen. Here she is. We were hoping you wouldn't get here till it was over. Come and look at your Baby,"" she said, with a good-humored snicker, keeping his head comfortably supported on the palm of her hand.",1
2378,"How do you feel now, son? Gant asked kindly. Better,"" he mumbled, discovering, with some elation, that his vocal paralysis was not permanent.",1
2379,"Well, you see! Helen began, kindly enough, but with a brooding satisfaction. It only goes to show we're all alike. We all like it. It's in our blood. That awful curse!",1
2380,"Eliza said. I had hoped that I might have one son who might escape it. It seems,"" she said, bursting into tears, ""as if a Judgment were on us. The sins of the fathers--""  ""Oh! for heaven's sake!",1
2381,"Helen cried angrily. Stop it! It's not going to kill him: he'll learn a lesson from it. Gant gnawed his thin lip, and wetted his great thumb in the old manner.",1
2382,"You might know,"" he said, ""that I'd get the blame for it. Yes--if one of them broke a leg it would be the same. There's one thing sure!"" said Eliza.",1
2383,"None of them ever got it from my side of the house. Say what you will, his grandfather, Major Pentland, never in his life allowed a drop in his house. Major Pentland be damned!"" said Gant.",1
2384,"If you'd depended on him for anything you'd have gone hungry. Certainly, thought Eugene, you'd have gone thirsty. Forget it!"" said Helen. It's Christmas. Let's try to have a little peace and quiet once a year. When they had left him, the boy tried to picture them lulled in the dulcet tranquillity they so often invoked.",1
2385,"Its effects, he thought, would be more disastrous than any amount of warfare. In the darkness, everything around and within him swam hideously. But presently he slid down into a pit of distressed sleep.",1
2386,"Every one had agreed on a studious forgiveness. They stepped with obtrusive care around his fault, filled pleasantly with Christmas and mercy. Ben scowled at him quite naturally, Helen grinned and prodded him, Eliza and Luke surrendered themselves to sweetness, sorrow, and silence. Their forgiveness made a loud noise in his ears.",1
2387,"During the morning his father asked him to come for a walk. Gant was embarrassed and hang-dog; a duty of gentle admonishment devolved upon him--he had been counselled to it by Helen and Eliza. Now, no man in his time could carry on in the big, Bow-wow style better than Gant, but none was less fitted to scatter the blossoms of sweetness and light. His wrath was sudden, his invective sprang from the moment, but he had for this occasion no thunder-bolts in his quiver, and no relish for the business before him. He had a feeling of personal guilt; he felt like a magistrate fining for intoxication a culprit with whom he has been on a spree the night before. Besides--what if the Bacchic strain in him had been passed on to his son?  They walked on in silence across the Square, by the rimmed fountain.",1
2388,"Gant cleared his throat nervously several times. Son,"" said he presently, ""I hope you'll take last night as a warning. It would be a terrible thing if you let whiskey get the best of you. I'm not going to speak harshly to you about it: I hope you'll learn a lesson by it. You had better be dead than become a drunkard.",1
2389,"There! He was glad it was over. I will! Eugene said. He was filled with gratitude and relief. How good every one was. He wanted to make passionate avowals, great promises. He tried to speak. But he couldn't. There was too much to be said.",1
2390,"But they had their Christmas, beginning thus with parental advice and continuing through all the acts of contrition, love, and decorum. They put on, over their savage lives, the raiment of society, going diligently through the forms and conventions, and thinking, ""now, we are like all other families""; but they were timid and shy and stiff, like rustics dressed in evening-clothes. But they could not keep silence. They were not ungenerous or mean: they were simply not bred to any restraint. Helen veered in the wind of hysteria, the strong uncertain tides of her temperament. At times when, before her own fire, her vitality sank, and she heard the long howl of the wind outside, she almost hated Eugene.",1
2391,"It's ridiculous! she said to Luke. His behaving like this. He's only a kid--he's had everything, we've had nothing! You see what it's come to, don't you?""  ""His college education has ruined him,"" said the sailor, not unhappy that his candle might burn more brightly in a naughty world.",1
2392,"Why don't you speak to her? she said irritably. She may listen to you--she won't to me! Tell her so! You've seen how she's rubbed it in to poor old papa, haven't you? Do you think that old man--sick as he is--is to blame? 'Gene's not a Gant, anyway. He takes after her side of the house. He's queer--like all of them! WE'RE Gants! she said with a bitter emphasis.",1
2393,"There was always some excuse for papa,"" said the sailor. He's had a lot to put up with. All his convictions in family affairs had been previously signed with her approval.",1
2394,"I wish you'd tell her that. With all his moping into books, he's no better than we are. If he thinks he's going to lord it over me, he's mistaken. I'd like to see him try it when I'm around,"" said Luke grimly.",1
2395,"The boy was doing a multiple penance--he had committed his first great wrong in being at once so remote from them and so near to them. His present trouble was aggravated by the cross-complication of Eliza's thrusts at his father, and the latent but constantly awakening antagonism of mother and daughter. In addition, he bore directly Eliza's nagging and carping attack. All this he was prepared for--it was the weather of his mother's nature (she was as fond of him as of any of them, he thought), and the hostility of Helen and Luke was something implacable, unconscious, fundamental, that grew out of the structure of their lives. He was of them, he was recognizably marked, but he was not with them, nor like them. He had been baffled for years by the passionate enigma of their dislike--their tenders of warmth and affection, when they came, were strange to him: he accepted them gratefully and with a surprise he did not wholly conceal. Otherwise, he had grown into a shell of sullenness and quiet: he spoke little in the house.",1
2396,"He was wearing ragged from the affair and its consequences. He felt that he was being unfairly dealt with, but as the hammering went on he drew his head bullishly down and held his tongue, counting the hours until his holiday should end. He turned silently to Ben--he should have turned nowhere. But the trusted brother, frayed and bitter on his own accord, scowled bitterly, and gave him the harsh weight of his tongue. This finally was unendurable. He felt betrayed--utterly turned against and set upon.",1
2397,"The outbreak came three nights before his departure as he stood, tense and stolid, in the parlor. For almost an hour, in a savage monotone, Ben had tried deliberately, it seemed, to goad him to an attack. He had listened without a word, smothering in pain and fury, and enraging by his silence the older brother who was finding a vent for his own alien frustration.",1
2398,"--and don't stand there scowling at me, you little thug. I'm telling you for your own good. I'm only trying to keep you from being a jailbird, you know. The trouble with you,"" said Luke, ""is that you have no appreciation for what's been done for you.",1
2399,"Everything's been done for you, and you haven't sense enough to appreciate it. Your college education has ruined you. The boy turned slowly on Ben.",1
2400,"All right, Ben,"" he muttered. That's enough, now. I don't care what he says, but I've had enough of it from you. This was the admission the older one had wanted.",1
2401,"They were all in very chafed and ugly temper. Don't talk back to me, you little fool, or I'll bat your brains out. The boy sprang at his brother like a cat, with a snarling cry.",1
2402,"He bore him backward to the floor as if he were a child, laying him down gently and kneeling above him, because he had been instantly shocked by the fragility of his opponent and the ease of his advantage. He struggled with such mixed rage and shame as those who try quietly to endure the tantrum of a trying brat. As he knelt above Ben, holding his arms pinned, Luke fell heavily on his back, uttering excited cries, strangling him with one arm and cuffing awkwardly with the other.",1
2403,"All right, B-B-Ben,"" he chattered, ""you grab his legs. A free scrimmage upon the floor followed, with such a clatter of upset scuttles, fire-irons, and chairs, that Eliza was brought at a fast gallop from the kitchen. Mercy! she shrieked, as she reached the door. They'll kill him!",1
2404,"But, although being subdued--in the proud language of an older South ""defeated, sir, but never beaten""--Eugene was doing very well for his age, and continued to chill the spines of his enemies with strange noises in his larynx, even after they had all clambered panting to their feet. I f-f-f-fink he's gone crazy,"" said Luke. He j-j-jumped on us without a word of warning. The hero replied to this with a drunken roll of the head, a furious dilation of the nostrils, and another horrible noise in his throat.",1
2405,"What's to become of us!"" wept Eliza. When brother strikes brother, it seems that the smash-up has come. She lifted the padded arm-chair, and placed it on its legs again.",1
2406,"When he could speak, Eugene said quietly, to control the trembling of his voice:  ""I'm sorry I jumped on you, Ben.  You,"" he said to the excited sailor, ""jumped on my back like a coward. But I'm sorry for what's happened. I'm sorry for what I did the other night and now. I said so, and you wouldn't leave me alone. You've tried to drive me crazy with your talk. And I didn't,"" he choked, ""I didn't think you'd turn against me as you have. I know what the others are like--they hate me!""  ""Hate you!"" cried Luke excitedly.",1
2407,"For G-g-god's sake! You talk like a fool. We're only trying to help you, for your own good. Why should we hate you!",1
2408,"Yes, you hate me,"" Eugene said, ""and you're ashamed to admit it. I don't know why you should, but you do. You wouldn't ever admit anything like that, but it's the truth. You're afraid of the right words. But it's been different with you,"" he said, turning to Ben. We've been like brothers--and now, you've gone over against me. Ah!",1
2409,"Ben muttered, turning away nervously. You're crazy. I don't know what you're talking about! He lighted a cigarette, holding the match in a hand that trembled.",1
2410,"But although the boy had used a child's speech of woe and resentment, they knew there was a core of truth in what he had said. Children, children!"" said Eliza sadly. We must try to love one another. Let's try to get along together this Christmas--what time's left. It may be the last one we'll ever have together. She began to weep:  ""I've had such a hard life,"" she said, ""it's been strife and turmoil all the way. It does seem I deserve a little peace and happiness now. They were touched with the old bitter shame: they dared not look at one another.",1
2411,"But they were awed and made quiet by the vast riddle of pain and confusion that scarred their lives. No one, 'Gene,"" Luke began quietly, ""has turned against you. We want to help you--to see you amount to something. You're the last chance--if booze gets you the way it has the rest of us, you're done for. The boy felt very tired; his voice was flat and low.",1
2412,"He began to speak with the bluntness of despair: what he said had undebatable finality. And how are you going to keep booze from getting me, Luke?"" he said. By jumping on my back and trying to strangle me? That's on a level with every other effort you've ever made to know me. Oh,"" said Luke ironically, ""you don't think we understand you?""  ""No,"" Eugene said quietly.",1
2413,"I don't think you do. You know nothing whatever about me. I know nothing about you--or any of you. I have lived here with you for seventeen years and I'm a stranger. In all that time have you ever talked to me like a brother? Have you ever told me anything of yourself? Have you ever tried to be a friend or a companion to me?""  ""I don't know what you want,"" Luke answered, ""but I thought I was acting for the best.",1
2414,"As to telling you about myself, what do you want to know?""  ""Well,"" said Eugene slowly, ""you're six years older than I am: you've been away to school, you've worked in big cities, and you are now enlisted in the United States Navy. Why do you always act like God Almighty,"" he continued with rankling bitterness. I know what sailors do! You're no better than I am! What about liquor? What about women?""  ""That's no way to talk before your mother,"" said Luke sternly.",1
2415,"No, son,"" said Eliza in a troubled voice. I don't like that way of talking. Then I won't talk like that,"" Eugene said.",1
2416,"But I had expected you to say that. We do not want to be told what we know. We do not want to call things by their names, although we're willing to call one another bad ones. We call meanness nobility and hatred honor. The way to make yourself a hero is to make me out a scoundrel. You won't admit that either, but it's true. Well, then, Luke, we won't talk of the ladies, black or white, you may or may not know, because it would make you uncomfortable. Instead, you can keep on being God and I'll listen to your advice, like a little boy in Sunday School. But I'd rather read the Ten Commandments where it's written down shorter and better. Son,"" said Eliza again with her ancient look of trouble and frustration, ""we must try to get on together.",1
2417,"No,"" he said. Alone. I have done an apprenticeship here with you for seventeen years, but it is coming to an end. I know now that I shall escape; I know that I have been guilty of no great crime against you, and I am no longer afraid of you. Why, boy!"" said Eliza.",1
2418,"We've done all we could for you. What crime have we accused you of?""  ""Of breathing your air, of eating your food, of living under your roof, of having your life and your blood in my veins, of accepting your sacrifice and privation, and of being ungrateful for it all. We should all be thankful for what we have,"" said Luke  sententiously.",1
2419,"Many a fellow would give his right eye for the chance you've been given. I've been given nothing! said Eugene, his voice mounting with a husky flame of passion. I'll go bent over no longer in this house. What chance I have I've made for myself in spite of you all, and over your opposition. You sent me away to the university when you could do nothing else, when it would have been a crying disgrace to you among the people in this town if you hadn't. You sent me off after the Leonards had cried me up for three years, and then you sent me a year too soon--before I was sixteen--with a box of sandwiches, two suits of clothes, and instructions to be a good boy. They sent you some money, too,"" said Luke.",1
2420,"Don't forget that. I'd be the only one who would, if I did,"" the boy answered. For that is really what is behind everything, isn't it? My crime the other night was not in getting drunk, but in getting drunk without any money of my own. If I did badly at the university with money of my own, you'd dare say nothing, but if I do well on money you gave me, I must still be reminded of your goodness and my unworthiness. Why, son!"" said Eliza diplomatically, ""no one has a word to say against the way you've done your work.",1
2421,"We're very proud of you. You needn't be,"" he said sullenly. I've wasted a great deal of time and some money. But I've had something out of it--more than most--I've done as much work for my wages as you deserve. I've given you a fair value for your money; I thank you for nothing. What's that!",1
2422,"What's that!"" said Eliza sharply. I said I thank you for nothing, but I take that back. That's better!"" said Luke.",1
2423,"Yes, I have a great deal to give thanks for,"" said Eugene. I give thanks for every dirty lust and hunger that crawled through the polluted blood of my noble ancestors. I give thanks for every scrofulous token that may ever come upon me. I give thanks for the love and mercy that kneaded me over the washtub the day before my birth. I give thanks for the country slut who nursed me and let my dirty bandage fester across my navel. I give thanks for every blow and curse I had from any of you during my childhood, for every dirty cell you ever gave me to sleep in, for the ten million hours of cruelty or indifference, and the thirty minutes of cheap advice. Unnatural!",1
2424,"Eliza whispered. Unnatural son! You will be punished if there's a just God in heaven. Oh, there is!",1
2425,"I'm sure there is! cried Eugene. Because I have been punished. By God, I shall spend the rest of my life getting my heart back, healing and forgetting every scar you put upon me when I was a child. The first move I ever made, after the cradle, was to crawl for the door, and every move I have made since has been an effort to escape. And now at last I am free from you all, although you may hold me for a few years more. If I am not free, I am at least locked up in my own prison, but I shall get me some beauty, I shall get me some order out of this jungle of my life: I shall find my way out of it yet, though it take me twenty years more--alone. Alone?"" said Eliza, with the old suspicion.",1
2426,"Where are you going?""  ""Ah,"" he said, ""you were not looking, were you? I've gone. 33   During the few remaining days of his holiday, he stayed almost entirely away from the house, coming for a brief and mumbled meal, and late at night, for bed.",1
2427,"He waited for departure as a prisoner for release. The dolorous prelude to a journey--the wet platform eyes, the sudden radiation of hectic warmth, the declarations of love at sound of the whistle--left him this time unmoved. The tear-ducts, he was beginning to discover, had, like sweat-glands, dermic foundations, and were easily brought to a salty sparkle at mere sight of a locomotive. He had, therefore, the somewhat detached composure of a gentleman on his way to a comfortable week- end, who stands in a noisy crowd, waiting for the ferry.",1
2428,"He gave benediction to the words in which he had so happily defined his position as wage-earner. They stated and confirmed an attitude, and in some measure protected him against the constant betrayals of sentiment. During the Spring he worked stupendously at joining activities, knowing that here was coin whose ring they could hear. He wrote conscientiously each item of his distinctions; his name found its way back more than once to the indulgent Altamont papers. Gant kept the clippings proudly, and gave public readings when he could.",1
2429,"The boy had two short awkward letters from Ben, who was now stationed one hundred miles away, in the tobacco town. At Easter, Eugene visited him, staying at his lodgings, where again his unerring destiny had thrown him into the welcoming arms of a gray- haired widow. She was under fifty--a handsome silly woman, who prodded and teased him as she would an adored child. She addressed him--with a loose giggle--as ""Old Curly-Head,"" at which he fetched out his usual disgusted plea to his Maker. O my God!  Listen to this! She had reverted to an astonishing romping girlhood, and would exercise her playfulness by leaping suddenly upon Old Curly- Head, dealing him a stiff dig in the ribs, and skipping away with a triumphant ""Hah! Got you that time! There was forever in that town a smell of raw tobacco, biting the nostrils with its acrid pungency: it smote the stranger coming from the train, but all the people in the town denied it, saying:  ""No; there is no smell at all.",1
2430,"And within a day the stranger too could smell it no more. On Easter morning he arose in the blue light and went with the other pilgrims to the Moravian cemetery. You ought to see it,"" Ben said. It's a famous custom: people come from everywhere. But the older brother did not go. Behind massed bands of horns, the trumpeting blare of trombones, the big crowds moved into the strange burial ground where all the stones lay flat upon the graves--symbol, it was said, of all-levelling Death. But as the horns blared, the old ghoul-fantasy of death returned, the grave slabs made him think of table-cloths: he felt as if he were taking part in some obscene feast.",1
2431,Spring was coming on again across the earth like a light sparkle of water-spray: all of the men who had died were making their strange and lovely return in blossom and flower. Ben walked along the streets of the tobacco town looking like asphodel. It was strange to find a ghost there in that place: his ancient soul prowled wearily by the cheap familiar brick and all the young facades.,1
2432,There was a Square on high ground; in the centre a courthouse. Cars were parked in close lines. Young men loitered in the drug- store.,1
2433,"How real it is, Eugene thought. It is like something we have always known about and do not need to see. The town would not have seemed strange to Thomas Aquinas,--but he to the town.",1
2434,"Ben prowled along, greeting the merchants with a grave scowl, leaning his skull against their round skulls of practicality, across their counters--a phantom soliciting advertisement in a quiet monotone. This is my kid brother, Mr. Fulton. Hello, son!",1
2435,"Dogged if you don't grow tall 'uns up there, Ben. Well, if you're like Old Ben, young fellow, we won't kick. We think a lot of him here. That's like thinking well of Balder, in Connecticut, Eugene thought.",1
2436,"I have only been here three months,"" said Ben, resting in bed on his elbow and smoking a cigarette. But I know all the leading business men already. I'm well thought of here. He glanced at his brother quickly and grinned, with a shy charm of rare confession. But his fierce eyes were desperate and lonely. Hill- haunted? For--home? He smoked.",1
2437,"You see, they think well of you, once you get away from your people. You'll never have a chance at home, 'Gene. They'll ruin everything for you. For heaven's sake, get away when you can.-- What's the matter with you? Why are you looking at me like that? he said sharply, alarmed at the set stare of the boy's face. In a moment he said:  ""They'll spoil your life. Can't you forget about her?""  ""No,"" said Eugene.",1
2438,"In a moment he added:  ""She's kept coming back all Spring. He twisted his throat with a wild cry. The Spring advanced with a mounting hum of war. The older students fell out quietly and drifted away to enlistments. The younger strained tensely, waiting. The war brought them no sorrow: it was a pageant which might, they felt, pluck them instantly into glory. The country flowed with milk and honey. There were strange rumors of a land of Eldorado to the north, amid the war industry of the Virginia coast. Some of the students had been there, the year before: they brought back stories of princely wages. One could earn twelve dollars a day, with no experience. One could assume the duties of a carpenter, with only a hammer, a saw, and a square. No questions were asked.",1
2439,"War is not death to young men; war is life. The earth had never worn raiment of such color as it did that year. The war seemed to unearth pockets of ore that had never been known in the nation: there was a vast unfolding and exposure of wealth and power. And somehow--this imperial wealth, this display of power in men and money, was blended into a lyrical music. In Eugene's mind, wealth and love and glory melted into a symphonic noise: the age of myth and miracle had come upon the world again. All things were possible.",1
2440,"He went home stretched like a bowstring and announced his intention of going away into Virginia. There was protest, but not loud enough to impede him. Eliza's mind was fastened on real-estate and the summer trade. Gant stared into the darkness at his life. Helen laughed at him and scolded him; then fell to plucking at her chin, absently.",1
2441,"Can't do without her? You can't fool me! No, sir. I know why you want to go,"" she said jocularly. She's a married woman now: she may have a baby, for all you know. You've no right to go after her. Then abruptly, she said:  ""Well, let him go if he wants to.",1
2442,"It looks silly to me, but he's got to decide for himself. He got twenty-five dollars from his father--enough to pay his railway fare to Norfolk and leave him a few dollars. Mark my words,"" said Gant. You'll be back in a week's time. It's a wild-goose chase you're going on. He went.",1
2443,"All through the night he drew toward her across Virginia, propped on his elbow in the berth and staring bewitched upon the great romantic country clumped with dreaming woodlands and white as a weird dawn beneath the blazing moonlight. Early in the morning he came to Richmond. He had to change trains; there was a wait. He went out from the station and walked up the hill toward the fine old State House drenched cleanly in the young morning light. He ate breakfast at a lunchroom on Broad Street, filled already with men going to their work. This casual and brief contact with their lives, achieved after his lonely and magnificent approach through the night, thrilled him by its very casualness. All the little ticking sounds of a city beginning its day, the strange familiarity of voices in an alien place, heard curiously after the thunder of the wheels, seemed magical and unreal. The city had no existence save that which he conferred on it: he wondered how it had lived before he came, how it would live after he left. He looked at all the men, feeding with eyes that held yet the vast moon-meadows of the night and the cool green width of the earth. They were like men in a zoo; he gazed at them, looking for all the little particular markings of the town, the fine mapping upon their limbs and faces of their own little cosmos. And the great hunger for voyages rose up in him--to come always, as now at dawn, into strange cities, striding in among them, and sitting with them unknown, like a god in exile, stored with the enormous vision of the earth.",1
2444,"The counterman yawned and turned the crackling pages of a morning paper. That was strange. Cars clanked by, beginning to work through the town. Merchants lowered their awnings; he left them as their day began.",1
2445,"An hour later he was riding for the sea. Eighty miles away lay the sea and Laura. She slept unwitting of the devouring wheels that brought him to her. He looked at the aqueous blue sky whitened with little clouds, and at the land wooded with pines and indefinable tokens of the marshes and bright salt.",1
2446,"The train drew under the boat-shed at Newport News. The terrific locomotive, as beautiful as any ship, breathed with unlaborious fatigue at the rail-head. There, by lapping water, she came to rest, like a completed destiny.",1
2447,"The little boat lay waiting at the dock. Within a few minutes he had left the hot murky smell of the shed and was cruising out into the blue water of the Roads. A great light wind swept over the water, making a singing noise through the tackle of the little boat, making a music and a glory in his heart. He drove along the little decks at a bounding stride, lunging past the staring people, with wild noises in his throat. The lean destroyers, the bright mad camouflage of the freighters and the transports, the lazy red whirl of a propeller, half-submerged, and the light winey sparkle of the waves fused to a single radiance and filled him with glory. He cried back into the throat of the enormous wind, and his eyes were wet.",1
2448,"Upon the decks of the boats, clean little figures in white moved about; under the bulging counter of a huge Frenchman young naked men were swimming. They come from France, he thought, and it is strange that they should be here. O, the wonder, the magic and the loss! His life was like a great wave breaking in the lonely sea; his hungry shoulder found no barriers--he smote his strength at nothing, and was lost and scattered like a wrack of mist. But he believed that this supreme ecstasy which mastered him and made him drunken might some day fuse its enormous light into a single articulation. He was Phaeton with the terrible horses of the sun: he believed that his life might pulse constantly at its longest stroke, achieve an eternal summit.",1
2449,"The hot Virginias broiled under the fierce blue oven of the sky, but in the Roads the ships rocked in the freshening breeze of war and glory. Eugene remained in the furnace of Norfolk for four days, until his money was gone. He watched it go without fear, with a sharp quickening of his pulses, tasting the keen pleasure of his loneliness and the unknown turnings of his life. He sensed the throbbing antennae of the world: life purred like a hidden dynamo, with the vast excitement of ten thousand glorious threats. He might do all, dare all, become all. The far and the mighty was near him, around him, above him. There was no great bridge to span, no hard summit to win. From obscurity, hunger, loneliness, he might be lifted in a moment into power, glory, love. The transport loading at the docks might bear him war-ward, love-ward, fame-ward Wednesday night.",1
2450,"He walked by lapping water through the dark. He heard its green wet slap against the crusted pier-piles: he drank its strong cod scent, and watched the loading of great boats drenched in blazing light as they weltered slowly down into the water. And the night was loud with the rumble of huge cranes, the sudden loose rattle of the donkey-engines, the cries of the overseers, and the incessant rumbling trucks of stevedores within the pier.",1
2451,"His imperial country, for the first time, was gathering the huge thrust of her might. The air was charged with murderous exuberance, rioting and corrupt extravagance. Through the hot streets of that town seethed the toughs, the crooks, the vagabonds of a nation--Chicago gunmen, bad niggers from Texas, Bowery bums, pale Jews with soft palms, from the shops of the city, Swedes from the Middle-West, Irish from New England, mountaineers from Tennessee and North Carolina, whores, in shoals and droves, from everywhere. For these the war was a fat enormous goose raining its golden eggs upon them. There was no thought or belief in any future. There was only the triumphant Now. There was no life beyond the moment. There was only an insane flux and re-flux of getting and spending.",1
2452,"Young men from Georgia farms came, in the evenings, from their work on piers, in camps, in shipyards, to dress up in their peacock plumage. And at night, hard and brown and lean of hand and face, they stood along the curbing in $18.00 tan leathers, $80.00 suits, and $8.00 silk shirts striped with broad alternating bands of red and blue. They were carpenters, masons, gang overseers, or said they were: they were paid ten, twelve, fourteen, eighteen dollars a day.",1
2453,"They shifted, veered from camp to camp, worked for a month, loafed opulently for a week, enjoying the brief bought loves of girls they met upon the ocean-beach or in a brothel. Strapping black buck-niggers, with gorilla arms and the black paws of panthers, earned $60 a week as stevedores, and spent it on a mulatto girl in a single evening of red riot. And more quietly, soberly, in this crowd, moved the older thriftier workmen: the true carpenters, the true masons, the true mechanics-- the canny Scotch-Irish of North Carolina, the fishermen of the Virginia coast, the careful peasantry of the Middle-West, who had come to earn, to save, to profit from the war.",1
2454,"Everywhere amid this swarming crowd gleamed the bright raiment of blood and glory: the sailors thronged the streets in flapping blues and spotless whites--brown, tough, and clean. The marines strode by in arrogant twos, stiff as rods in the loud pomp of chevrons and striped trousers. Commanders gray and grim, hard-handed C. P. O.'s, and elegant young ensigns out of college, with something blonde and fluffy at their side, went by among the red cap-buttons of French matelots, or the swagger sea-wise port of the Englishmen.",1
2455,"Through this crowd, with matted uncut hair that fell into his eyes, that shot its spirals through the rents of his old green hat, that curled a thick scroll up his dirty neck, Eugene plunged with hot devouring eyes--soaked in his sweat by day, sharp and stale by night. In this great camp of vagrant floaters he lost himself: he came home into this world from loneliness. The hunger for voyages, the hunger that haunts Americans, who are a nomad race, was half- assuaged here in this maelstrom of the war.",1
2456,"He lost himself in the crowd. He lost count of the days. His little store of money melted. He moved from a cheap hotel, loud at night with the noise of harlotry, to a little attic room in a lodging-house, an oven of hot pine and tarred roof; he moved from the lodging-house to a fifty-cent cot in the Y. M. C. A., where, returning night by night, he paid his fee, and slept in a room with forty snoring sailors.",1
2457,"Finally, his money gone, he slept, until driven out, in all-night lunchrooms; upon the Portsmouth ferry; and over lapping water on a rotting pier. By night he prowled about among the negroes; he listened to their rich proposed seductions; he went where the sailors went, down Church Street, where the women were. He prowled the night with young beast-lust, his thin boy-body stale with sweat, his hot eyes burning through the dark.",1
2458,"He grew hungry for food. His money was gone. But there was a hunger and thirst in him that could not be fed. Over the chaos of his brain hung the shadow of Laura James. Her shadow hung above the town, above all life. It had brought him here; his heart was swollen with pain and pride; he would not go to find her.",1
2459,"He was obsessed with the notion that he would find her in the crowd, upon the street, around the corner. He would not speak to her if he met her. He would go proudly and indifferently by. He would not see her. She would see him. She would see him at some heroic moment, just as he was receiving the love and respect of beautiful women. She would speak to him; he would not speak to her. She would be stricken; she would be beaten down; she would cry to him for love and mercy.",1
2460,"Thus, unclean, unkempt, clothed in rags and hunger and madness, he saw himself victorious, heroic and beautiful. He was mad with his obsession. He thought he saw Laura on the streets a dozen times a day: his heart turned rotten; he did not know what he should do or say, whether to run or remain. He brooded for hours over her address in the telephone directory; sitting by the phone, he trembled with excitement because its awful magic could be sounded at a gesture, because within a minute he could be with her, voice to voice.",1
2461,"He hunted out her home. She was living in an old frame house far out from the centre of the town. He stalked carefully about the neighborhood, keeping a block away from the house at all times, observing it obliquely, laterally, from front and back, with stealthy eye and a smothering thud of the heart, but never passing before it, never coming directly to it.",1
2462,He was foul and dirty. The soles of his shoes wore through: his calloused feet beat against hot pavements. He stank.,1
2463,"At length, he tried to get work. Work there was in great abundance--but the princely wages of which he had been told were hard to find. He could not swear he was a carpenter, a mason. He was a dirty boy, and looked it. He was afraid. He went to the Navy Yard at Portsmouth, the Naval Base at Norfolk, the Bush Terminal--everywhere there was work, abundant work--hard labor that paid four dollars a day. This he would gladly have taken; but he found that he could not have his wages until after the second week, and that one week's pay would be withheld to tide him over in illness, trouble, or departure.",1
2464,"And he had no money left. He went to a Jew and pawned the watch Eliza had given him upon his birthday. He got five dollars on it. Then he went by boat once more to Newport News, and by trolley up the coast to Hampton. He had heard, in the thronging rumor of Norfolk, that there was work upon the flying field, and that the worker was fed and housed upon the field, at company expense.",1
2465,"In the little employment shack at the end of the long bridge that led across into the field, he was signed on as a laborer and searched by the sentry, who made him open his valise. Then he labored across the bridge, kneeing his heavy bag, which bulged with his soiled and disorderly belongings, before him. He staggered at length into the rude company office and sought out the superintendent, a man in the thirties, shaven, pale, weary, who wore a blue eyeshade, armbands, and talked with a limp cigarette plastered on his lip.",1
2466,"Eugene thrust out his employment slip in shaking fingers. The man looked briefly at it. College boy, aren't you, son? he said, glancing at Eugene.",1
2467,"Yes, sir,"" said Eugene. Did you ever do day labor before?"" said the man. No, sir,"" said Eugene.",1
2468,"How old are you, son? the man asked. Eugene was silent for a moment. I'm--nineteen,"" he said at length, wondering, since he had lied, why he had not had courage to say twenty.",1
2469,"The superintendent grinned wearily. It's hard work, son,"" the man said. You'll be among the wops and the Swedes and the hunkies. You'll live in the same bunkhouse, you'll eat with them. They don't smell nice, son. I have no money,"" said Eugene.",1
2470,"I'll work hard. I won't get sick. Give me the job. Please!""  ""No,"" said the man.",1
2471,"No, I won't do that. Eugene turned blindly away. I tell you what I'll do,"" said the superintendent. I'll give you a job as a checker. You'll be with the office force. That's where you belong. You'll live with them in their own bunk-house. They're nice fellows,"" he said elegantly, ""college fellows, like yourself. Thank you,"" said Eugene, clenching his fingers, with husky emotion.",1
2472,"Thank you. The checker we've got is quitting,"" said the superintendent. You'll go to the stables with him in the morning to get your horse. H-h-h-horse?"" said Eugene.",1
2473,"You'll have a horse,"" said the superintendent, ""to ride around on. With strong bowel-excitement Eugene began to think of the horse, with joy, with fear. He turned to go. He could not bear to talk of money.",1
2474,"H-h-how much--?"" he finally croaked, feeling that he must. Business. I'll give you $80 a month to begin with,"" said the manager with a touch of magnificence. If you make good, I'll give you a hundred.",1
2475,"And my keep?"" whispered Eugene. Sure!"" said the manager. That's thrown in. Eugene reeled away with his valise, and with a head full of exploding rockets.",1
2476,"These months, although filled with terror and hunger, must be passed in rapid summary with bare mention of the men and actions that a lost boy knew. They belong to a story of escape and wandering--valuable here to indicate the initiation to the voyage this life will make. They are a prelude to exile, and into their nightmare chaos no other purpose may be read than the blind groping of a soul toward freedom and isolation.",1
2477,"Eugene worked upon the Flying Field for a month. Three times a day he rode around the field to check the numbers of two dozen gangs who were engaged in the work of grading, levelling, blasting from the spongy earth the ragged stumps of trees and filling interminably, ceaselessly, like the weary and fruitless labor of a nightmare, the marshy earth-craters, which drank their shovelled toil without end. The gangs were of all races and conditions: Portugee niggers, ebony-black, faithful and childlike, who welcomed him with great toothy grins, each pointing to his big white pin, on which was printed his number, crying out in strange outlandish voices, ""feefety-nine, nine-net-ty seex,"" and so on; Bowery bums, in greasy serge and battered derbies, toying distastefully with pick-handles that shredded their dirty uncalloused palms--their hard evil faces, with their smudge of beard, were like things corrupt, green-yellow, that grow under barrels. And there were also drawling fishermen from the Virginia coast, huge gorilla niggers from Georgia and the lower South, Italians, Swedes, Irishmen--part of the huge compost of America.",1
2478,"He came to know them and their overseers--tough reckless men, gray- haired and lustful, full of swift action and coarse humor. Stuck like a jigging doll upon the horse, whom he feared, he rode, staring into heaven, sometimes almost unconscious of the great engine expanding and contracting below him with a brown sensual rhythm. The bird-men filled the blue Virginia weather with the great drone of the Liberties.",1
2479,"At length, hungry again for the ships and faces, he left his work and spent his earnings in a week of gaudy riot in Norfolk and on the Virginia beaches. Almost penniless again, with only the savage kaleidoscope of a thousand streets, a million lights, the blazing confusion and the strident noise of carnival, he returned to Newport News in search of employment, accompanied by another youth from Altamont, likewise a thriftless adventurer in war-work, whom he had found upon the beach. This worthy, whose name was Sinker Jordan, was three years older than Eugene. He was a handsome reckless boy, small in stature, and limping from an injury he had received in a football game. His character was weak and volatile-- he hated effort, and was obstinate only in cursing ill-fortune.",1
2480,"The two young men had a few dollars between them. They pooled their resources, and, with wild optimism, purchased from a pawnbroker in Newport News the rudiments of carpenter's equipment-- hammers, saws, and T-squares. They went inland fifteen or twenty miles to a dreary government camp sweltering in the Virginia pines. They were refused employment here and in black dejection returned in the afternoon to the town they had left so hopefully in the morning. Before sundown they had secured employment in the Shipbuilding Yards, but they had been discharged five minutes after they reported for work, when they confessed to a grinning foreman in a room full of woodshavings and quietly slatting belts, that they had no knowledge of the intensely special carpentry of ship's carving. Nor (they might have added) of any other.",1
2481,"They were quite moneyless now, and once on the street again, Sinker Jordan had hurled upon the pavement the fatal tools, cursing savagely the folly that threatened now to keep them hungry. Eugene picked the tools up, and took them back to the imperturbable Uncle, who repurchased them for only a few dollars less than the sum they had paid him in the morning. Thus the day. They found a lodging in a dingy house where, as an appropriate climax to his folly, Sinker Jordan surrendered their remaining capital into the greedy palm of the landlady--and a real lady too, she admitted. But, having previously eaten, they had all the hope of a full belly and their youth--they slept, Sinker without care and without effort.",1
2482,"Eugene was early up at dawn, and after futile efforts to waken the luxuriously somnolent Sinker, he was off to the dingy yellow piers along the waterfront, which were stored with munitions for the war. After a morning tramping up and down the dusty road outside the guarded enclosure, he had obtained employment for himself and Sinker from the chief checker, a nervous ugly man, swollen with petty tyranny. He had gimlet eyes, glittering below spectacles, and hard muscular jaws that writhed constantly.",1
2483,"Eugene went to work at seven the next morning--Sinker, a day or two later, only when his last small coin had vanished. Eugene screwed up his pride and borrowed a few dollars from one of the other checkers. On this he and Sinker lived meagerly until pay-day-- which was only a few days off. This money slipped quickly through their careless fingers. Down to a few coins again, with the next pay-day almost two weeks off, Sinker gambled at dice with the checkers, behind the great fortress of sacked oats upon the pier-- lost, won, lost, rose penniless and cursing God. Eugene knelt beside the checkers, with his last half-dollar in his palm, heedless of Sinker's bitter taunt. He had never thrown dice before: naturally, he won--$8.50. He rose exultantly from their profane surprise, and took Sinker to dinner at the best hotel.",1
2484,"A day or two later, he went behind the oats again, gambled with his last dollar--and lost. He began to starve. Day crawled into weary day. The fierce eye of July beat down upon the pier with a straight insufferable glare. The boats and trains slid in and out, crammed to the teeth with munitions--with food for the soldiers. The hot grainy air on the pier swam before his eyes speckled with dancing patches, and he made weary tallies on a sheet as the big black stevedores swarmed past him with their trunks. Sinker Jordan cadged small sums from the other checkers, and lived miserably on bottled pop and cheese at a little grocery across the road from the pier. Eugene was unable to beg or borrow. Partly from pride, but more from the powerful brooding inertia of his temper, which more and more was governing his will to act, he found himself unable to speak. Each day he said:  ""I shall speak to one of them to-day. I shall say that I must eat, and that I have no money. But when he tried to speak he could not.",1
2485,"As they grew more efficient in their work they were called back, after the day's end, for work at night. This extra work, with its time-and-a-half pay, he would otherwise have been glad to get, but stumbling from exhaustion, the command to return was horrible. For several days now he had not been home to the dingy little room which he shared with Sinker Jordan. At the end of his day's work, he would climb to a little oasis in the enormous wall of sacked oats and sink into exhausted sleep, with the rattling of cranes and winches, the steady rumble of the trucks, and the remote baying of boats anchored in the stream--mixing in a strange faint symphony in his ears.",1
2486,"And he lay there, with the fading glimmer of the world about him, as the war mounted to its climax of blood and passion during that terrible month. He lay there, like his own ghost, thinking with pain, with grief, of all the million towns and faces he had not known. He was the atom for which all life had been aplot--Caesar had died and a nameless wife of Babylon, and somewhere here, upon this marvellous dying flesh, this myriad brain, their mark, their spirit, rested.",1
2487,"And he thought of the strange lost faces he had known, the lonely figures of his family, damned in chaos, each chained to a destiny of ruin and loss--Gant, a fallen Titan, staring down enormous vistas of the Past, indifferent to the world about him; Eliza, beetle-wise, involved in blind accretions; Helen, childless, pathless, furious--a great wave breaking on the barren waste; and finally, Ben--the ghost, the stranger, prowling at this moment in another town, going up and down the thousand streets of life, and finding no doors. But the next day, on the pier, Eugene was weaker than ever. He sat sprawled upon a throne of plump oat sacks, with blurred eyes watching the loading of the bags at the spout, marking raggedly his tally upon the sheet as the stevedores plunged in and out. The terrible heat steamed through the grainy pollen of the air: he moved each limb with forethought, picking it up and placing it as if it were a detached object.",1
2488,"At the end of the day he was asked to return for night-work. He listened, swaying on his feet, to the far-sounding voice of the chief checker. The supper hour came, upon the heated pier, with the sudden noise of silence. There were small completed noises up and down the enormous shed: a faint drumming of footfalls of workers walking toward the entrance, a slap of water at the ship's hull, a noise from the bridge.",1
2489,"Eugene went behind the oat pile and climbed blindly up until he reached his little fortress at the top. The world ebbed from his fading sense: all sound grew fainter, more far. Presently, he thought, when I have rested here, I shall get up and go down to work. It has been a hot day. I am tired. But when he tried to move he could not. His will struggled against the imponderable lead of his flesh, stirring helplessly like a man in a cage. He thought quietly, with relief, with tranquil joy. They will not find me here. I cannot move. It is over. If I had thought of this long ago, I would have been afraid. But I'm not, now. Here-- upon this oat pile--doing my bit--for Democracy. I'll begin to stink. They'll find me then.",1
2490,"Life glimmered away out of his weary eyes. He lay, half-conscious, sprawled upon the oats. He thought of the horse.",1
2491,"In this way the young checker, who had loaned him money, found him. The checker knelt above him, supporting Eugene's head with one hand, and putting a bottle of raw hard liquor to his mouth with the other. When the boy had revived somewhat, the checker helped him to descend the pile and walked slowly with him up the long wooden platform of the pier.",1
2492,"They went across the road to a little grocery-store. The checker ordered a bottle of milk, a box of crackers, and a big block of cheese. As Eugene ate, the tears began to flow down his grimy face, dredging dirty gullies on his skin. They were tears of hunger and weakness: he could not restrain them.",1
2493,"The checker stood over him watchfully, with a kindly troubled stare. He was a young man with a lantern jaw, and a thin dish face: he wore scholarly spectacles, and smoked a pipe reflectively. Why didn't you tell me, boy? I'd have let you have the money,"" he said.",1
2494,"I--don't--know,"" said Eugene, between bites of cheese. Couldn't. With the checker's loan of five dollars he and Sinker Jordan lived until pay-day.",1
2495,"Then, after dining together on four pounds of steak, Sinker Jordan departed for Altamont and the enjoyment of an inheritance which had fallen due a few days before, on his twenty- first birthday. Eugene stayed on. He was like a man who had died, and had been re-born. All that had gone before lived in a ghostly world. He thought of his family, of Ben, of Laura James, as if they were ghosts. The world itself turned ghost. All through that month of August, while the war marched to its ending, he looked upon its dying carnival. Nothing seemed any longer hard and hot and raw and new. Everything was old. Everything was dying. A vast aerial music, forever far- faint, like the language of his forgotten world, sounded in his ears. He had known birth. He had known pain and love. He had known hunger. Almost he had known death.",1
2496,"At night, when he was not called back to work he rode out by trolley to one of the Virginia beaches. But the only sound that was real, that was near and present, was the sound in his heart, in his brain, of the everlasting sea. He turned his face toward it: behind him, the cheap million lights of the concessionaires, the clatter, the racket, the confetti, the shrill blare of the saxophones, all the harsh joyless noise of his country, was softened, was made sad, far, and phantom. The wheeling merry-go- round, the blaring dance-orchestra, played K-K-K-Katy Beautiful Katy, Poor Little Buttercup, and Just a Baby's Prayer at Twilight.",1
2497,"And that cheap music turned elfin and lovely; it was mixed into magic--it became a part of the romantic and lovely Virginias, of the surge of the sea, as it rolled in from the eternal dark, across the beach, and of his own magnificent sorrow--his triumphant loneliness after pain and love and hunger. His face was thin and bright as a blade, below the great curling shock of his hair; his body as lean as a starved cat's; his eyes bright and fierce. O sea! (he thought) I am the hill-born, the prison-pent, the ghost, the stranger, and I walk here at your side. O sea, I am lonely like you, I am strange and far like you, I am sorrowful like you; my brain, my heart, my life, like yours, have touched strange shores. You are like a woman lying below yourself on the coral floor. You are an immense and fruitful woman with vast thighs and a great thick mop of curling woman's hair floating like green moss above your belly. And you will bring me to the happy land, you will wash me to glory in bright ships.",1
2498,"There by the sea of the dark Virginias, he thought of the forgotten faces, of all the million patterns of himself, the ghost of his lost flesh. The child that heard Swain's cow, the lost boy in the Ozarks, the carrier of news among the blacks, and the boy who went in by the lattice with Jim Trivett. And the waitress, and Ben, and Laura? Dead, too? Where? How? Why? Why has the web been woven? Why do we die so many deaths? How came I here beside the sea? O lost, O far and lonely, where?",1
2499,"Sometimes, as he walked back among the dancers, a scarecrow in flapping rags, he looked and saw himself among them. He seemed to be two people: he constantly saw himself with dark bent face sitting upon the top rail of a fence, watching himself go by with a bright herd of young people. He saw himself among the crowds, several inches shorter than he was, fitting comfortably into a world where everything was big enough for him.",1
2500,"And while he stared and saw himself beloved and admitted, he heard them laugh: he felt suddenly the hard white ring of their faces about him, and he plunged away, with cursing mouth. O my sweet bitches! My fine cheap sluts! You little crawling itch of twiddlers: you will snigger at me! At me! At me! (He beat his hands against his ribs.) You will mock at me, with your drug-store pimps, your Jazz-bo apes, your gorilla gobs, you cute little side- porch chippies! What do you understand? The lust of a goat, the stink of your kind--that does for you, my girls. And yet you laugh at me! Ah, but I'll tell you why you laugh: you are afraid of me because I am not like the others. You hate me because I do not belong. You see I am finer and greater than any one you know: you cannot reach me and you hate me. That's it! The ethereal (yet manly) beauty of my features, my boyish charm (for I am Just a Boy) blended with the tragic wisdom of my eyes (as old as life and filled with the brooding tragedy of the ages), the sensitive and delicate flicker of my mouth, and my marvellous dark face blooming inward on strange loveliness like a flower--all this you want to kill because you cannot touch it. Ah me! (Thinking of his strange beauty, his eyes grew moist with love and glory, and he was forced to blow his nose.) Ah, but She will know. The love of a lady. Proudly, with misty eyes, he saw her standing beside him against the rabble: her elegant small head, wound with a bracelet of bright hair, against his shoulder, and with two splendid pearls in her ears. Dearest! Dearest! We stand here on a star. We are beyond them now. Behold! They shrink, they fade, they pass--victorious, enduring, marvellous love, my dearest, we remain.",1
2501,"Brooding thus on the vision of his own beauty, stirred by his own heroic music, with misty eyes, he would pass over into the forbidden settlement, with its vigilant patrols of naval and military police on the watch for their own, and prowl softly down a dark little street to a dingy frame house with drawn blinds, where dwelt a love that for three dollars could be bought and clothed with his own fable. Her name was Stella Blake. She was never in a hurry.",1
2502,"With her lived a young corn-haired girl of twenty years whose family lived in Pulpit Hill. Sometimes he went to see her. Twice a week the troops went through. They stood densely in brown and weary thousands on the pier while a council of officers, tabled at the gangways, went through their clearance papers. Then, each below the sweating torture of his pack, they were filed from the hot furnace of the pier into the hotter prison of the ship. The great ships, with their motley jagged patches of deception, waited in the stream: they slid in and out in unending squadrons.",1
2503,"Sometimes the troops were black--labor regiments from Georgia and Alabama; big gorilla bucks from Texas. They gleamed with sweat and huge rich laughter: they were obedient as children and called their cursing officers ""boss. And don't you call me 'boss' again, you bastards!"" screamed a young Tennessee lieutenant, who had gone slowly insane during the moving, as he nursed his charges through hell.",1
2504,"They grinned at him cheerfully, with affection, like good obedient children, as he stamped, raving, up and down the pier. From time to time they goaded him into a new frenzy with complaints about lost hats, bayonets, small arms, and papers. Somehow he found things for them; somehow he cursed his way through, keeping them in order. They grinned affectionately, therefore, and called him boss.",1
2505,"And what in Jesus' name have you done now?"" he yelled, as a huge black sergeant with several enlisted men, who had gathered at the examiner's table, burst suddenly into loud roars of grief. The fiery lieutenant rushed at the table, cursing. The sergeant and several enlisted men, all Texas darkies, had come away from camp without a clean bill of health: they were venereals and had not been cured.",1
2506,"Boss,"" blubbered the big black sergeant, ""we wants to go to France. We don't want to git lef' in dis Gawd-dam hole. (Nor do I blame them, thought Eugene.)",1
2507,"I'll kill you! So help me God, I'll kill you! screamed the officer, hurling his trim cap upon the ground and stamping upon it. But, a moment later, with a medical officer he was leading them away for examination behind the great wall of sacked oats. Five minutes later they emerged. The negroes were cavorting with joy: they pressed around their fierce commander, seizing and kissing his hand, fawning upon him, adoring him.",1
2508,"You see,"" said the dish-faced checker, while he and Eugene watched, ""that's what it takes to hold a crowd of niggers. You can't be nice to 'em. They'd do anything for that guy. He would for them,"" said Eugene.",1
2509,"These negroes, he thought, who came from Africa, were sold at the block in Louisiana, and live in Texas, are now on their way to France. Mr. Finch, the chief checker with the ugly slit eyes, approached Eugene with a smile of false warmth. His gray jaws worked.",1
2510,"I've got a job for you, Gant,"" he said. Double-time pay. I want you to get in on some of the easy money. What is it?"" said Eugene.",1
2511,"They're loading this ship with big stuff,"" said Mr. Finch. They're taking her into the stream to get it on. I want you to go out with her. They'll take you off in a tug to-night. The dish-faced checker, when jubilantly he told him of his appointment, said:  ""They asked me to go, but I wouldn't.",1
2512,"Why not?"" said Eugene. I don't want the money bad enough. They're loading her with T. N. T. and nitro-glycerin. The niggers play baseball with those cases. If they ever drop one, they'll bring you home in a bucket. It's all in the day's work,"" said Eugene dramatically.",1
2513,"This was danger, war. He was definitely in on it, risking his hide for Democracy. He was thrilled.",1
2514,"When the big freighter slid away from the pier, he stood in the bow with spread legs, darting his eyes about with fierce eagle glances. The iron decks blistered his feet through the thin soles of his shoes. He did not mind. He was the captain.",1
2515,"She anchored seaward down the Roads, and the great barges were nosed in by the tugs. All through the day, under a broiling sun, they loaded her from the rocking barges: her huge yellow booms swung up and down; by nightfall she rode deeply in the water, packed to her throat with shells and powder, and bearing on the hot plates of her deck 1200 grisly tons of field artillery. Eugene stood with fierce appraising eyes, walking about the guns with a sense of authority, jotting down numbers, items, pieces. From time to time he thrust a handful of moist scrap-tobacco into his mouth, and chewed with an air of relish. He spat hot sizzling gobs upon the iron deck. God! thought he. This is man's work. Heave-ho, ye black devils! There's a war on! He spat.",1
2516,"The tug came at nightfall and took him off. He sat apart from the stevedores, trying to fancy the boat had come for him alone. The lights went twinkling up the far Virginia shores. He spat into the swirling waters.",1
2517,"When the trains slid in and out, the stevedores raised the wooden bridges that spanned the tracks. Foot by foot, with rhythmic pull and halt, the gangs tugged at the ropes, singing, under the direction of their leader their song of love and labor:  ""Jelly Roll! (Heh!) Je-e-elly Roll. They were great black men, each with his kept woman.",1
2518,"They earned fifty or sixty dollars a week. Once or twice again, in the dying summer, Eugene went to Norfolk. He saw the sailor, but he no longer tried to see Laura. She seemed far and lost.",1
2519,"He had not written home all summer. He found a letter from Gant, written in his father's Gothic sprawl--a sick and feeble letter, written sorrowfully and far away. O lost! Eliza, in the rush and business of the summer trade, had added a few practical lines. Save his money. Get plenty of good food. Keep well. Be a good boy.",1
2520,"The boy was a lean column of brown skin and bone. He had lost over thirty pounds during the summer: he was over six foot four and weighed little more than one hundred and thirty pounds. The sailor was shocked at his emaciation, and bullied him with blustering reproof:  ""Why didn't you t-t-tell me where you were, idiot?",1
2521,I'd have sent you money. For G-g-god's sake!  Come on and eat! They ate.,1
2522,"The summer waned. When September came, Eugene quit his work and, after a luxurious day or two in Norfolk, started homeward. But, at Richmond, where there was a wait of three hours between trains, he changed his plans suddenly and went to a good hotel.",1
2523,"He was touched with pride and victory. In his pockets he had $130 that he had won hardily by his own toil. He had lived alone, he had known pain and hunger, he had survived. The old hunger for voyages fed at his heart. He thrilled to the glory of the secret life. The fear of the crowd, a distrust and hatred of group life, a horror of all bonds that tied him to the terrible family of the earth, called up again the vast Utopia of his loneliness. To go alone, as he had gone, into strange cities; to meet strange people and to pass again before they could know him; to wander, like his own legend, across the earth--it seemed to him there could be no better thing than that.",1
2524,"He thought of his own family with fear, almost with hatred. My God! Am I never to be free? he thought. What have I done to deserve this slavery? Suppose--suppose I were in China, or in Africa, or at the South Pole. I should always be afraid of his dying while I was away. (He twisted his neck as he thought of it.) And how they would rub it in to me if I were not there! Enjoying yourself in China (they would say) while your father was dying. Unnatural son! Yes, but curse them! Why should I be there? Can they not die alone? Alone! O God, is there no freedom on this earth?",1
2525,"With quick horror, he saw that such freedom lay a weary world away, and could be bought by such enduring courage as few men have. He stayed in Richmond several days, living sumptuously in the splendid hotel, eating from silver dishes in the grill, and roaming pleasantly through the wide streets of the romantic old town, to which he had come once as a Freshman at Thanksgiving, when the university's team had played Virginia there. He spent three days trying to seduce a waitress in an ice-cream and candy-store: he lured her finally to a curtained booth in a chop-suey restaurant, only to have his efforts fail when the elaborate meal he had arranged for with the Chinaman aroused her distaste because it had onions in it.",1
2526,"Before he went home he wrote an enormous letter to Laura James at Norfolk, a pitiable and boasting letter which rose at its end to an insane crow:  ""I was there all summer and I never looked you up. You were not decent enough to answer my letters; I saw no reason why I should bother with you any more. Besides, the world is full of women; I got my share and more this summer. He mailed the letter, with a sense of malevolent triumph.",1
2527,"But the moment the iron lid of the box clanged over it, his face was contorted by shame and remorse: he lay awake, writhing as he recalled the schoolboy folly of it. She had beaten him again. 34   Eugene returned to Altamont two weeks before the term began at Pulpit Hill.",1
2528,"The town and the nation seethed in the yeasty ferment of war. The country was turning into one huge camp. The colleges and universities were being converted into training-camps for officers. Every one was ""doing his bit. It had been a poor season for tourists.",1
2529,"Eugene found Dixieland almost deserted, save for a glum handful of regular or semi-regular guests. Mrs. Pert was there, sweet, gentle, a trifle more fuzzy than usual. Miss Newton, a wrenny and neurotic old maid, with asthma, who had gradually become Eliza's unofficial assistant in the management of the house, was there. Miss Malone, the gaunt drug-eater with the loose gray lips, was there. Fowler, a civil engineer with blond hair and a red face, who came and departed quietly, leaving a sodden stench of corn-whiskey in his wake, was there. Gant, who had now moved definitely from the house on Woodson Street, which he had rented, to a big back room at Eliza's, was there--a little more waxen, a little more petulant, a little feebler than he had been before. And Ben was there.",1
2530,"He had been home for a week or two when Eugene arrived. He had been rejected again by both army and navy examining boards, he had been rejected as unfit in the draft; he had left his work suddenly in the tobacco town and come quietly and sullenly home. He was thinner and more like old ivory than ever. He prowled softly about the house, smoking innumerable cigarettes, cursing in brief snarling fury, touched with despair and futility. His old surly scowl was gone, his old angry mutter; his soft contemptuous laugh, touched with so much hidden tenderness, had given way to a contained but savage madness.",1
2531,"During the brief two weeks that Eugene remained at home before departing again for Pulpit Hill, he shared with Ben a little room and sleeping-porch upstairs. And the quiet one talked--talked himself from a low fierce mutter into a howling anathema of bitterness and hate that carried his voice, high and passionate, across all the sleeping world of night and rustling autumn. What have you been doing to yourself, you little fool? he began, looking at the boy's starved ribs. You look like a scarecrow. I'm all right,"" said Eugene.",1
2532,"I wasn't eating for a while. But I didn't write them,"" he added proudly. They thought I couldn't hold out by myself. But I did. I didn't ask for help. And I came home with my own money. See? He thrust his hand into his pocket and pulled out his soiled roll of banknotes, boastfully displaying it.",1
2533,"Who wants to see your lousy little money? Ben yelled furiously. Fool. You come back, looking like a dead man, as if you'd done something to be proud of. What've you done? What've you done except make a monkey of yourself?""  ""I've paid my own way,"" Eugene cried resentfully, stung and wounded.",1
2534,"That's what I've done. Ah-h,"" said Ben, with an ugly sneer, ""you little fool! That's what they've been after! Do you think you've put anything over on them? Do you? Do you think they give a damn whether you die or not, as long as you save them expense? What are you bragging about? Don't brag until you've got something out of them. Propped on his arm, he smoked deeply, in bitter silence, for a moment.",1
2535,"Then more quietly, he continued. No, 'Gene. Get it out of them any way you can. Make them give it to you. Beg it, take it, steal it--only get it somehow. If you don't, they'll let it rot. Get it, and get away from them. Go away and don't come back. To hell with them! he yelled.",1
2536,"Eliza, who had come softly upstairs to put out the lights, and had been standing for a moment outside the door, rapped gently and entered. Clothed in a tattered old sweater and indefinable under- lappings, she stood for a moment with folded hands, peering in on them with a white troubled face. Children,"" she said, pursing her lips reproachfully, and shaking her head, ""it's time every one was in bed. You're keeping the whole house awake with your talk. Ah-h,"" said Ben with an ugly laugh, ""to hell with them.",1
2537,"I'll vow, child! she said fretfully. You'll break us up. Have you got that porch light on, too? Her eyes probed about suspiciously. What on earth do you mean by burning up all that electricity!""  ""Oh, listen to this, won't you?"" said Ben, jerking his head upward with a jeering laugh.",1
2538,"I can't afford to pay all these bills,"" said Eliza angrily, with a smart shake of her head. And you needn't think I can. I'm not going to put up with it. It's up to us all to economize. Oh, for God's sake!",1
2539,"Ben jeered. Economize! What for? So you can give it all away to Old Man Doak for one of his lots?""  ""Now, you needn't get on your high-horse,"" said Eliza.",1
2540,"You're not the one who has to pay the bills. If you did, you'd laugh out of the other side of your mouth. I don't like any such talk. You've squandered every penny you've earned because you've never known the value of a dollar. Ah-h!",1
2541,"he said. The value of a dollar! By God, I know the value of a dollar better than you do. I've had a little something out of mine, at any rate. What have you had out of yours? I'd like to know that. What the hell's good has it ever been to any one? Will you tell me that?"" he yelled.",1
2542,"You may sneer all you like,"" said Eliza sternly, ""but if it hadn't been for your papa and me accumulating a little property, you'd never have had a roof to call your own. And this is the thanks I get for all my drudgery in my old age,"" she said, bursting into tears. Ingratitude!  Ingratitude!""  ""Ingratitude!"" he sneered.",1
2543,"What's there to be grateful for? You don't think I'm grateful to you or the old man for anything, do you? What have you ever given me? You let me go to hell from the time I was twelve years old. No one has ever given me a damned nickel since then. Look at your kid here. You've let him run around the country like a crazy man. Did you think enough of him this summer to send him a post-card? Did you know where he was? Did you give a damn, as long as there was fifty cents to be made out of your lousy boarders?""  ""Ingratitude!",1
2544,"she whispered huskily, with a boding shake of the head. A day of reckoning cometh. Oh, for God's sake!",1
2545,"he said, with a contemptuous laugh. He smoked for a moment. Then he went on quietly:  ""No, mama.",1
2546,"You've done very little to make us grateful to you. The rest of us ran around wild and the kid grew up here among the dope-fiends and street-walkers. You've pinched every penny and put all you've had into real estate which has done no one any good. So don't wonder if your kids aren't grateful to you. Any son who will talk that way to his mother,"" said Eliza with rankling bitterness, ""is bound to come to a bad end.",1
2547,"Wait and see!""  ""The hell you say! he sneered. They stared at each other with hard bitter eyes. He turned away in a moment, scowling with savage annoyance, but stabbed already with fierce regret.",1
2548,"All right! Go on, for heaven's sake! Leave us alone! I don't want you around! He lit a cigarette to show his indifference. The lean white fingers trembled, and the flame went out.",1
2549,"Let's stop it!"" said Eugene wearily. Let's stop it! None of us is going to change! Nothing's going to get any better. We're all going to be the same. We've said all this before. So, for God's sake, let's stop it! Mama, go to bed, please. Let's all go to bed and forget about it. He went to her, and with a strong sense of shame, kissed her.",1
2550,"Well, good-night, son,"" said Eliza slowly, with gravity. If I were you I'd put the light out now and turn in. Get a good night's sleep, boy. You mustn't neglect your health. She kissed him, and went away without another glance at the older boy.",1
2551,"He did not look at her. They were parted by hard and bitter strife. After a moment, when she had gone, Ben said without anger:  ""I've had nothing out of life.",1
2552,"I've been a failure. I've stayed here with them until I'm done for. My lungs are going: they won't even take a chance on me for the army. They won't even give the Germans a chance to shoot at me. I've never made good at anything. By God! he said, in a mounting blaze of passion. What's it all about? Can you figure it out, 'Gene? Is it really so, or is somebody playing a joke on us? Maybe we're dreaming all this. Do you think so?""  ""Yes,"" said Eugene, ""I do.",1
2553,"But I wish they'd wake us up. He was silent, brooding over his thin bare body, bent forward on the bed for a moment. Maybe,"" he said slowly, ""maybe--there's nothing, nobody to wake. To hell with it all!"" said Ben.",1
2554,"I wish it were over. Eugene returned to Pulpit Hill in a fever of war excitement. The university had been turned into an armed camp. Young men who were eighteen years old were being admitted into the officers' training corps. But he was not yet eighteen. His birthday was two weeks off. In vain he implored the tolerance of the examining board. What did two weeks matter? Could he get in as soon as his birthday arrived? They told him he could not. What, then, could he do? They told him that he must wait until there was another draft. How long would that be? Only two or three months, they assured him. His wilted hope revived. He chafed impatiently. All was not lost.",1
2555,"By Christmas, with fair luck, he might be eligible for service in khaki: by Spring, if God was good, all the proud privileges of trench-lice, mustard gas, spattered brains, punctured lungs, ripped guts, asphyxiation, mud and gangrene, might be his. Over the rim of the earth he heard the glorious stamp of the feet, the fierce sweet song of the horns. With a tender smile of love for his dear self, he saw himself wearing the eagles of a colonel on his gallant young shoulders. He saw himself as Ace Gant, the falcon of the skies, with 63 Huns to his credit by his nineteenth year. He saw himself walking up the Champs-Elysées, with a handsome powdering of gray hair above his temples, a left forearm of the finest cork, and the luscious young widow of a French marshal at his side. For the first time he saw the romantic charm of mutilation. The perfect and unblemished heroes of his childhood now seemed cheap to him-- fit only to illustrate advertisements for collars and toothpaste. He longed for that subtle distinction, that air of having lived and suffered that could only be attained by a wooden leg, a rebuilt nose, or the seared scar of a bullet across his temple.",1
2556,"Meanwhile, he fed voraciously, and drank gallons of water in an effort to increase his poundage. He weighed himself a half-dozen times a day. He even made some effort at systematic exercise: swinging his arms, bending from his hips, and so on.",1
2557,"And he talked about his problem with the professors. Gravely, earnestly, he wrestled with his soul, mouthing with gusto the inspiring jargon of the crusade. For the present, said the professors, was his Place not Here? Did his Conscience tell him that he Had to go? If it did, they said gravely, they would say nothing more. But had he considered the Larger Issues?  ""Is not,"" said the Acting Dean persuasively, ""is not this your Sector?",1
2558,"Is your own Front Line not here on the campus? Is it not here that you must Go Over The Top? Oh, I know,"" he went on with a smile of quiet pain, ""I know it would be easier to go. I have had to fight that battle myself. But we are all part of the Army now; we are all enlisted in the Service of Liberty. We are all Mobilized for Truth. And each must Do His Bit where it will count for most. Yes,"" said Eugene, with a pale tortured face, ""I know.",1
2559,"I know it's wrong. But oh, sir,--when I think of those murderous beasts, when I think of how they have menaced All that we Hold Dear, when I think of Little Belgium, and then of My Own Mother, My Own Sister--"" He turned away, clenching his hands, madly in love with himself. Yes, yes,"" said the Acting Dean gently, ""for boys with a spirit like yours it's not easy. Oh, sir, it's hard!",1
2560,"cried Eugene passionately. I tell you it's hard. We must endure,"" said the Dean quietly.",1
2561,"We must be tempered in the fire. The Future of Mankind hangs in the balance. Deeply stirred they stood together for a moment, drenched in the radiant beauty of their heroic souls.",1
2562,"Eugene was managing editor of the college paper. But, since the editor was enlisted in the corps, the entire work of publication fell to the boy. Every one was in the army. With the exception of a few dozen ratty Freshmen, a few cripples, and himself, every one, it seemed, was in the army. All of his fraternity brothers, all of his college mates, who had not previously enlisted, and many young men who had never before thought of college, were in the army. Pap"" Rheinhart, George Graves, Julius Arthur--who had experienced brief and somewhat unfortunate careers at other universities, and a host of young Altamonters who had never known a campus before, were all enlisted now in the Student's Army.",1
2563,"During the first days, in the confusion of the new order, Eugene saw a great deal of them. Then, as the cogs of the machine began to grind more smoothly, and the university was converted into a big army post, with its punctual monotony of drilling, eating, studying, inspection, sleeping, he found himself detached, alone, occupying a position of unique and isolated authority. He Carried On. He Held High the Torch. He Did His Bit. He was editor, reporter, censor, factotum of the paper. He wrote the news. He wrote the editorials. He seared them with flaming words. He extolled the crusade. He was possessed of the inspiration for murder.",1
2564,"He came and he went as he chose. When the barracks went dark at night, he prowled the campus, contemptuous of the electric flash and the muttered apologies of the officious shave-tails. He roomed in the village with a tall cadaver, a gaunt medical student with hollow cheeks and a pigeon-breast, named Heston. Three or four times a week he was driven over the rutted highway to Exeter where, in a little print shop, he drank the good warm smell of ink and steel.",1
2565,"Later, he prowled up the dreary main street of the town as the lights went up, ate at the Greek's, flirted with a few stray furtive women until the place went dead at ten o'clock, and came back through the dark countryside in a public-service car beside a drunken old walrus who drove like a demon, and whose name was ""Soak"" Young. October began, and a season of small cold rain. The earth was a sodden reek of mud and rotten leaves. The trees dripped wearily and incessantly. His eighteenth birthday came, and he turned again, with a quivering tension, toward the war.",1
2566,"He got a brief sick letter from his father; a few pages, practical, concrete with her blunt pungent expression, from Eliza:  ""Daisy has been here with all her tribe. She went home two days ago, leaving Caroline and Richard. They have all been down sick with the flu. We've had a siege of it here. Every one has had it, and you never know who's going to be next. It seems to get the big strong ones first. Mr. Hanby, the Methodist minister, died last week. Pneumonia set in. He was a fine healthy man in the prime of life. The doctors said he was gone from the start. Helen has been laid up for several days. Says it's her old kidney trouble. They had McGuire in Thursday night. But they can't fool me, no matter what they say. Son, I hope you will never surrender to that awful craving. It has been the curse of my life. Your papa seems to go along about the same as usual. He eats well, and gets lots of sleep. I can't notice any change in him from a year ago. He may be here long after some of the rest of us are under the sod. Ben is still here. He mopes around the house all day and complains of having no appetite. I think he needs to get to work again doing something that will take his mind off himself. There are only a few people left in the house. Mrs. Pert and Miss Newton hang on as usual. The Crosbys have gone back to Miami. If it gets much colder here I'll just pack up and go too. I guess I must be getting old. I can't stand the cold the way I could when I was young. I want you to buy yourself a good warm overcoat before the winter sets in. You must also eat plenty of good substantial food. Don't squander your money but . . . He heard nothing more for several weeks.",1
2567,"Then, one drizzling evening at six o'clock, when he returned to the room that he occupied with Heston, he found a telegram. It read:  ""Come home at once. Ben has pneumonia.  Mother. 35   There was no train until the next day.",1
2568,"Heston quieted him during the evening with a stiff drink of gin manufactured from alcohol taken from the medical laboratory. Eugene was silent and babbled incoherently by starts: he asked the medical student a hundred questions about the progress and action of the disease. If it were double pneumonia she would have said so. Doesn't it seem that way to you? Hey?"" he demanded feverishly.",1
2569,"I should think so,"" said Heston. He was a kind and quiet boy. Eugene went to Exeter the next morning to catch the train. All through a dreary gray afternoon it pounded across the sodden State. Then, there was a change and a terrible wait of several hours at a junction. Finally, as dark came, he was being borne again toward the hills.",1
2570,"Within his berth he lay with hot sleepless eyes, staring out at the black mass of the earth, the bulk of the hills. Finally, in the hours after midnight, he dropped into a nervous doze. He was wakened by the clatter of the trucks as they began to enter the Altamont yards. Dazed, half-dressed, he was roused by the grinding halt, and a moment later was looking out through the curtains into the grave faces of Luke and Hugh Barton.",1
2571,"Ben's very sick,"" said Hugh Barton. Eugene pulled on his shoes and dropped to the floor, stuffing his collar and tie into a coat pocket. Let's go,"" he said. I'm ready. They went softly down the aisle, amid the long dark snores of the sleepers.",1
2572,"As they walked through the empty station toward Hugh Barton's car, Eugene said to the sailor:  ""When did you get home, Luke?""  ""I came in last night,"" he said. I've been here only a few hours. It was half-past three in the morning.",1
2573,"The ugly station settlement lay fixed and horrible, like something in a dream. His strange and sudden return to it heightened his feeling of unreality. In one of the cars lined at the station curbing, the driver lay huddled below his blanket. In the Greek's lunchroom a man sat sprawled faced downward on the counter. The lights were dull and weary: a few burned with slow lust in the cheap station-hotels.",1
2574,"Hugh Barton, who had always been a cautious driver, shot away with a savage grinding of gears. They roared townward through the rickety slums at fifty miles an hour. I'm afraid B-B-B-Ben is one sick boy,"" Luke began.",1
2575,"How did it happen? Eugene asked. Tell me. He had taken influenza, they told Eugene, from one of Daisy's children.",1
2576,"He had moped about, ill and feverish, for a day or two, without going to bed. In that G-g-g-god dam cold barn,"" Luke burst out. If that boy dies it's because he c-c-c-couldn't keep warm. Never mind about that now,"" Eugene cried irritably, ""go on.",1
2577,"Finally he had gone to bed, and Mrs. Pert had nursed him for a day or two. She was the only one who d-d-d-did a damn thing for him,"" said the sailor. Eliza, at length, had called in Cardiac.",1
2578,"The d-d-damned old quack,"" Luke stuttered. Never mind! Never mind! Eugene yelled. Why dig it up now? Get on with it!",1
2579,"After a day or two, he had grown apparently convalescent, and Cardiac told him he might get up if he liked. He got up and moped about the house for a day, in a cursing rage, but the next day he lay a-bed, with a high fever. Coker at length had been called in, two days before--  ""That's what they should have done at the start,"" growled Hugh Barton over his wheel.",1
2580,"Never mind! screamed Eugene. Get on with it. And Ben had been desperately ill, with pneumonia in both lungs, for over a day.",1
2581,"The sad prophetic story, a brief and terrible summary of the waste, the tardiness, and the ruin of their lives, silenced them for a moment with its inexorable sense of tragedy. They had nothing to say. The powerful car roared up into the chill dead Square. The feeling of unreality grew upon the boy. He sought for his life, for the bright lost years, in this mean cramped huddle of brick and stone. Ben and I, here by the City Hall, the Bank, the grocery-store (he thought). Why here? In Gath or Ispahan. In Corinth or Byzantium. Not here. It is not real.",1
2582,"A moment later, the big car sloped to a halt at the curb, in front of Dixieland. A light burned dimly in the hall, evoking for him chill memories of damp and gloom. A warmer light burned in the parlor, painting the lowered shade of the tall window a warm and mellow orange.",1
2583,"Ben's in that room upstairs,"" Luke whispered, ""where the light is. Eugene looked up with cold dry lips to the bleak front room upstairs, with its ugly Victorian bay-window. It was next to the sleeping-porch where, but three weeks before, Ben had hurled into the darkness his savage curse at life. The light in the sickroom burned grayly, bringing to him its grim vision of struggle and naked terror.",1
2584,"The three men went softly up the walk and entered the house. There was a faint clatter from the kitchen, and voices. Papa's in here,"" said Luke.",1
2585,"Eugene entered the parlor and found Gant seated alone before a bright coal-fire. He looked up dully and vaguely as his son entered. Hello, papa,"" said Eugene, going to him.",1
2586,"Hello, son,"" said Gant. He kissed the boy with his bristling cropped mustache. His thin lip began to tremble petulantly.",1
2587,"Have you heard about your brother?"" he snuffled. To think that this should be put upon me, old and sick as I am. O Jesus, it's fearful--""  Helen came in from the kitchen.",1
2588,"Hello, Slats,"" she said, heartily embracing him. How are you, honey? He's grown four inches more since he went away,"" she jeered, sniggering. Well, 'Gene, cheer up! Don't look so blue. While there's life there's hope. He's not gone yet, you know. She burst into tears, hoarse, unstrung, hysterical.",1
2589,"To think that this must come upon me,"" Gant sniffled, responding mechanically to her grief, as he rocked back and forth on his cane and stared into the fire. O boo-hoo-hoo! What have I done that God should--""  ""You shut up!",1
2590,"she cried, turning upon him in a blaze of fury. Shut your mouth this minute. I don't want to hear any more from you! I've given my life to you! Everything's been done for you, and you'll be here when we're all gone. You're not the one who's sick. Her feeling toward him had, for the moment, gone rancorous and bitter.",1
2591,"Where's mama? Eugene asked. She's back in the kitchen,"" Helen said. I'd go back and say hello before you see Ben if I were you. In a low brooding tone, she continued:  ""Well, forget about it. It can't be helped now. He found Eliza busy over several bright bubbling pots of water on the gas-stove.",1
2592,"She bustled awkwardly about, and looked surprised and confused when she saw him. Why, what on earth, boy! When'd you get in?""  He embraced her.",1
2593,"But beneath her matter-of-factness, he saw the terror in her heart: her dull black eyes glinted with bright knives of fear. How's Ben, mama?"" he asked quietly. Why-y,"" she pursed her lips reflectively, ""I was just saying to Doctor Coker before you came in. 'Look here,' I said. 'I tell you what, I don't believe he's half as bad off as he looks. Now, if only we can hold on till morning. I believe there's going to be a change for the better.' Mama, in heaven's name!",1
2594,"Helen burst out furiously. How can you bear to talk like that? Don't you know that Ben's condition is critical? Are you never going to wake up?""  Her voice had its old cracked note of hysteria.",1
2595,"Now, I tell you, son,"" said Eliza, with a white tremulous smile, ""when you go in there to see him, don't make out as if you knew he was sick. If I were you, I'd make a big joke of it all. I'd laugh just as big as you please and say, 'See here, I thought I was coming to see a sick man. Why, pshaw!' (I'd say) 'there's nothing wrong with you. Half of it's only imagination!'""  ""O mama!",1
2596,"for Christ's sake!"" said Eugene frantically. For Christ's sake!""  He turned away, sick at heart, and caught at his throat with his fingers. Then he went softly upstairs with Luke and Helen, approaching the sick-room with a shrivelled heart and limbs which had gone cold and bloodless. They paused for a moment, whispering, before he entered. The wretched conspiracy in the face of death filled him with horror.",1
2597,"N-n-n-now, I wouldn't stay but a m-m-m-minute,"" whispered Luke. It m-m-might make him nervous. Eugene, bracing himself, followed Helen blindly into the room.",1
2598,"Look who's come to see you,"" her voice came heartily. It's Highpockets. For a moment Eugene could see nothing, for dizziness and fear.",1
2599,"Then, in the gray shaded light of the room, he descried Bessie Gant, the nurse, and the long yellow skull's-head of Coker, smiling wearily at him, with big stained teeth, over a long chewed cigar. Then, under the terrible light which fell directly and brutally upon the bed alone, he saw Ben. And in that moment of searing recognition he saw, what they had all seen, that Ben was dying.",1
2600,"Ben's long thin body lay three-quarters covered by the bedding; its gaunt outline was bitterly twisted below the covers, in an attitude of struggle and torture. It seemed not to belong to him, it was somehow distorted and detached as if it belonged to a beheaded criminal. And the sallow yellow of his face had turned gray; out of this granite tint of death, lit by two red flags of fever, the stiff black furze of a three-day beard was growing. The beard was somehow horrible; it recalled the corrupt vitality of hair, which can grow from a rotting corpse. And Ben's thin lips were lifted, in a constant grimace of torture and strangulation, about his white somehow dead-looking teeth, as inch by inch he gasped a thread of air into his lungs.",1
2601,"And the sound of this gasping--loud, hoarse, rapid, unbelievable, filling the room, and orchestrating every moment in it--gave to the scene its final note of horror. Ben lay upon the bed below them, drenched in light, like some enormous insect on a naturalist's table, fighting, while they looked at him, to save with his poor wasted body the life that no one could save for him. It was monstrous, brutal.",1
2602,"As Eugene approached, Ben's fear-bright eyes rested upon the younger brother for the first time and bodilessly, without support, he lifted his tortured lungs from the pillow, seizing the boy's wrists fiercely in the hot white circle of his hands, and gasping in strong terror like a child: Why have you come? Why have you come home, 'Gene?""  The boy stood white and dumb for a moment, while swarming pity and horror rose in him.",1
2603,"They gave us a vacation, Ben,"" he said presently. They had to close down on account of the flu. Then he turned away suddenly into the black murk, sick with his poor lie, and unable to face the fear in Ben's gray eyes.",1
2604,"All right, 'Gene,"" said Bessie Gant, with an air of authority. Get out of here--you and Helen both. I've got one crazy Gant to look after already. I don't want two more in here. She spoke harshly, with an unpleasant laugh.",1
2605,"She was a thin woman of thirty-eight years, the wife of Gant's nephew, Gilbert. She was of mountain stock: she was coarse, hard, and vulgar, with little pity in her, and a cold lust for the miseries of sickness and death. These inhumanities she cloaked with her professionalism, saying:  ""If I gave way to my feelings, where would the patient be?""  When they got out into the hall again, Eugene said angrily to Helen:  ""Why have you got that death's-head here?",1
2606,"How can he get well with her around? I don't like her!""  ""Say what you like--she's a good nurse. Then, in a low voice, she said:  ""What do you think?""  He turned away, with a convulsive gesture.",1
2607,"She burst into tears, and seized his hand. Luke was teetering about restlessly, breathing stertorously and smoking a cigarette, and Eliza, working her lips, stood with an attentive ear cocked to the door of the sick-room. She was holding a useless kettle of hot water.",1
2608,"Huh?  Hah? What say?"" asked Eliza, before any one had said anything. How is he? Her eyes darted about at them.",1
2609,"Get away! Get away! Get away! Eugene muttered savagely. His voice rose. Can't you get away? He was infuriated by the sailor's loud nervous breathing, his large awkward feet.",1
2610,"He was angered still more by Eliza's useless kettle, her futile hovering, her ""huh?"" and ""hah?""  ""Can't you see he's fighting for his breath? Do you want to strangle him? It's messy! Messy! Do you hear? His voice rose again.",1
2611,"The ugliness and discomfort of the death choked him; and the swarming family, whispering outside the door, pottering uselessly around, feeding with its terrible hunger for death on Ben's strangulation, made him mad with alternate fits of rage and pity. Indecisively, after a moment, they went downstairs, still listening for sounds in the sick-room. Well, I tell you,"" Eliza began hopefully. I have a feeling, I don't know what you'd call it--""  She looked about awkwardly and found herself deserted. Then she went back to her boiling pots and pans.",1
2612,"Helen, with contorted face, drew him aside, and spoke to him in whispered hysteria, in the front hall. Did you see that sweater she's wearing? Did you see it? It's filthy! Her voice sank to a brooding whisper. Did you know that he can't bear to look at her? She came into the room yesterday, and he grew perfectly sick. He turned his head away and said 'O Helen, for God's sake, take her out of here.' You hear that, don't you. Do you hear? He can't stand to have her come near him. He doesn't want her in the room. Stop!  Stop!",1
2613,"For God's sake, stop! Eugene said, clawing at his throat. The girl was for the moment insane with hatred and hysteria.",1
2614,"It may be a terrible thing to say, but if he dies I shall hate her. Do you think I can forget the way she's acted? Do you? Her voice rose almost to a scream. She's let him die here before her very eyes. Why, only day before yesterday, when his temperature was 104, she was talking to Old Doctor Doak about a lot. Did you know that? Forget about it!",1
2615,"he said frantically. She'll always be like that! It's not her fault. Can't you see that? O God, how horrible! How horrible!""  ""Poor old mama!"" said Helen, beginning to weep.",1
2616,"She'll never get over this. She's scared to death! Did you see her eyes? She knows, of course she knows! Then suddenly, with mad brooding face, she said:  ""Sometimes I think I hate her!",1
2617,"I really think I hate her. She plucked at her large chin, absently. Well, we mustn't talk like this,"" she said. It's not right. Cheer up. We're all tired and nervous. I believe he's going to get all right yet. Day came gray and chill, with a drear reek of murk and fog.",1
2618,"Eliza bustled about eagerly, pathetically busy, preparing breakfast. Once she hurried awkwardly upstairs with a kettle of water, and stood for a second at the door as Bessie Gant opened it, peering in at the terrible bed, with her white puckered face. Bessie Gant blocked her further entrance, and closed the door rudely. Eliza went away making flustered apologies.",1
2619,"For, what the girl had said was true, and Eliza knew it. She was not wanted in the sick-room; the dying boy did not want to see her. She had seen him turn his head wearily away when she had gone in. Behind her white face dwelt this horror, but she made no confession, no complaint. She bustled around doing useless things with an eager matter-of-factness. And Eugene, choked with exasperation at one moment, because of her heavy optimism, was blind with pity the next when he saw the terrible fear and pain in her dull black eyes. He rushed toward her suddenly, as she stood above the hot stove, and seized her rough worn hand, kissing it and babbling helplessly.",1
2620,O mama! Mama! It's all right! It's all right! It's all right.,1
2621,"And Eliza, stripped suddenly of her pretenses, clung to him, burying her white face in his coat sleeve, weeping bitterly, helplessly, grievously, for the sad waste of the irrevocable years-- the immortal hours of love that might never be relived, the great evil of forgetfulness and indifference that could never be righted now. Like a child she was grateful for his caress, and his heart twisted in him like a wild and broken thing, and he kept mumbling:  ""It's all right! It's all right! It's all right!""--knowing that it was not, could never be, all right.",1
2622,"If I had known. Child, if I had known,"" she wept, as she had wept long before at Grover's death. Brace up! he said. He'll pull through yet. The worst is over. Well, I tell you,"" said Eliza, drying her eyes at once, ""I believe it is.",1
2623,"I believe he passed the turning-point last night. I was saying to Bessie--""  The light grew. Day came, bringing hope. They sat down to breakfast in the kitchen, drawing encouragement from every scrap of cheer doctor or nurse would give them. Coker departed, non- committally optimistic. Bessie Gant came down to breakfast and was professionally encouraging.",1
2624,"If I can keep his damn family out of the room, he may have some chance of getting well. They laughed hysterically, gratefully, pleased with the woman's abuse. How is he this morning?"" said Eliza. Do you notice any improvement?""  ""His temperature is lower, if that's what you mean.",1
2625,"They knew that a lower temperature in the morning was a fact of no great significance, but they took nourishment from it: their diseased emotion fed upon it--they had soared in a moment to a peak of hopefulness. And he's got a good heart,"" said Bessie Gant. If that holds out, and he keeps fighting, he'll pull through. D-d-don't worry about his f-f-fighting,"" said Luke, in a rush of eulogy.",1
2626,"That b-b-boy'll fight as long as he's g-g-got a breath left in him. Why, yes,"" Eliza began, ""I remember when he was a child of seven-- I know I was standing on the porch one day--the reason I remember is Old Mr. Buckner had just come by with some butter and eggs your papa had--""  ""O my God! groaned Helen, with a loose grin. Now we'll get it. Whah--whah!",1
2627,"Luke chortled crazily, prodding Eliza in the ribs. I'll vow, boy!"" said Eliza angrily. You act like an idiot. I'd be ashamed!""  ""Whah--whah--whah!""  Helen sniggered, nudging Eugene.",1
2628,"Isn't he crazy, though? Tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh. Then, with wet eyes, she drew Eugene roughly into her big bony embrace.",1
2629,"Poor old 'Gene. You always got on together, didn't you? You'll feel it more than any of us. He's not b-b-buried yet,"" Luke cried heartily.",1
2630,"That boy may be here when the rest of us are pushing d-d-daisies. Where's Mrs. Pert?"" said Eugene. Is she in the house? A strained and bitter silence fell upon them.",1
2631,"I ordered her out,"" said Eliza grimly, after a moment. I told her exactly what she was--a whore. She spoke with the old stern judiciousness, but in a moment her face began to work and she burst into tears. If it hadn't been for that woman I believe he'd be well and strong to-day. I'll vow I do!""  ""Mama, in heaven's name!",1
2632,"Helen burst out furiously. How dare you say a thing like that? She was the only friend he had: when he was taken sick she nursed him hand and foot. Why, the idea! The idea! she panted in her indignation. If it hadn't been for Mrs. Pert he'd have been dead by now. Nobody else did anything for him. You were willing enough, I notice, to keep her here and take her money until he got sick. No, sir! she declared with emphasis. Personally, I like her. I'm not going to cut her now. It's a d-d-d-damn shame!"" said Luke, staunch to his goddess.",1
2633,"If it hadn't been for Mrs. P-P-P-Pert and you, Ben would be S. O. L. Nobody else around here gave a damn. If he d-d-d-dies, it's because he didn't get the proper care when it would have done him some good. There's always been too d-d-damn much thought of saving a nickel, and too d-d-damn little about flesh and blood! Well, forget about it!"" said Helen wearily.",1
2634,"There's one thing sure: I've done everything I could. I haven't been to bed for two days. Whatever happens, I'll have no regrets on that score. Her voice was filled with a brooding ugly satisfaction.",1
2635,"I know you haven't! I know that! The sailor turned to Eugene in his excitement, gesticulating. That g-g-girl's worked her fingers to the bone. If it hadn't been for her--""  His eyes got wet; he turned his head away and blew his nose.",1
2636,"Oh, for Christ's sake! Eugene yelled, springing up from the table. Stop it, won't you! Let's wait till later. In this way, the terrible hours of the morning lengthened out, while they spent themselves trying to escape from the tragic net of frustration and loss in which they were caught.",1
2637,"Their spirits soared to brief moments of insane joy and exultancy, and plunged into black pits of despair and hysteria. Eliza alone seemed consistently hopeful. Trembling with exacerbated nerves, the sailor and Eugene paced the lower hall, smoking incessant cigarettes, bristling as they approached each other, ironically polite when their bodies touched. Gant dozed in the parlor or in his own room, waking and sleeping by starts, moaning petulantly, detached, vaguely aware only of the meaning of events, and resentful because of the sudden indifference to him. Helen went in and out of the sick-room constantly, dominating the dying boy by the power of her vitality, infusing him with moments of hope and confidence. But when she came out, her hearty cheerfulness was supplanted by the strained blur of hysteria; she wept, laughed, brooded, loved, and hated by turns.",1
2638,"Eliza went only once into the room. She intruded with a hotwater bag, timidly, awkwardly, like a child, devouring Ben's face with her dull black eyes. But when above the loud labor of his breath his bright eyes rested on her, his clawed white fingers tightened their grip in the sheets, and he gasped strongly, as if in terror:  ""Get out!",1
2639,Out! Don't want you. Eliza left the room.,1
2640,"As she walked she stumbled a little, as if her feet were numb and dead. Her white face had an ashen tinge, and her dull eyes had grown bright and staring. As the door closed behind her, she leaned against the wall and put one hand across her face. Then, in a moment, she went down to her pots again.",1
2641,"Frantically, angrily, with twitching limbs they demanded calm and steady nerves from one another; they insisted that they keep away from the sick-room--but, as if drawn by some terrible magnet, they found themselves again and again outside the door, listening, on tiptoe, with caught breath, with an insatiate thirst for horror, to the hoarse noise of his gasping as he strove to force air down into his strangled and cemented lungs. And eagerly, jealously, they sought entrance to the room, waiting their turn for carrying water, towels, supplies.  Mrs. Pert, from her refuge in the boarding-house across the street, called Helen on the phone each half-hour, and the girl talked to her while Eliza came from the kitchen into the hall, and stood, hands folded, lips pursed, with eyes that sparkled with her hate. The girl cried and laughed as she talked.",1
2642,"Well . . . that's all right, Fatty. . . . You know how I feel about it. . . . I've always said that if he had one true friend in the world, it's you . . . and don't think we're ALL ungrateful for what you've done. . . . During the pauses, Eugene could hear the voice of the other woman across the wires, sobbing.",1
2643,"And Eliza said, grimly:  ""If she calls up again you let me talk to her. I'll fix her!""  ""Good heavens, mama! Helen cried angrily. You've done enough already. You drove her out of the house when she'd done more for him than all his family put together. Her big strained features worked convulsively. Why, it's ridiculous!",1
2644,"Within Eugene, as he paced restlessly up and down the hall or prowled through the house a-search for some entrance he had never found, a bright and stricken thing kept twisting about like a trapped bird. This bright thing, the core of him, his Stranger, kept twisting its head about, unable to look at horror, until at length it gazed steadfastly, as if under a dreadful hypnosis, into the eyes of death and darkness. And his soul plunged downward, drowning in that deep pit: he felt that he could never again escape from this smothering flood of pain and ugliness, from the eclipsing horror and pity of it all. And as he walked, he twisted his own neck about, and beat the air with his arm like a wing, as if he had received a blow in his kidneys. He felt that he might be clean and free if he could only escape into a single burning passion--hard, and hot, and glittering--of love, hatred, terror, or disgust. But he was caught, he was strangling, in the web of futility--there was no moment of hate that was not touched by a dozen shafts of pity: impotently, he wanted to seize them, cuff them, shake them, as one might a trying brat, and at the same time to caress them, love them, comfort them.",1
2645,"As he thought of the dying boy upstairs, the messy ugliness of it-- as they stood whimpering by while he strangled--choked him with fury and horror. The old fantasy of his childhood came back to him: he remembered his hatred of the semi-private bathroom, his messy discomfort while he sat at stool and stared at the tub filled with dirty wash, sloppily puffed and ballooned by cold gray soapy water. He thought of this as Ben lay dying.",1
2646,"Their hopes revived strongly in the forenoon when word came to them that the patient's temperature was lower, his pulse stronger, the congestion of the lungs slightly relieved. But at one o'clock, after a fit of coughing, he grew delirious, his temperature mounted, he had increasing difficulty in getting his breath. Eugene and Luke raced to Wood's pharmacy in Hugh Barton's car, for an oxygen tank. When they returned, Ben had almost choked to death. Quickly they carried the tank into the room, and placed it near his head. Bessie Gant seized the cone, and started to put it over Ben's mouth, commanding him to breathe it in. He fought it away tigerishly: curtly the nurse commanded Eugene to seize his hands.",1
2647,"Eugene gripped Ben's hot wrists: his heart turned rotten. Ben rose wildly from his pillows, wrenching like a child to get his hands free, gasping horribly, his eyes wild with terror:  ""No!  No!  'Gene! 'Gene! No!  No!""  Eugene caved in, releasing him and turning way, white-faced, from the accusing fear of the bright dying eyes.",1
2648,Others held him. He was given temporary relief. Then he became delirious again.,1
2649,"By four o'clock it was apparent that death was near. Ben had brief periods of consciousness, unconsciousness, and delirium--but most of the time he was delirious. His breathing was easier, he hummed snatches of popular songs, some old and forgotten, called up now from the lost and secret adyts of his childhood; but always he returned, in his quiet humming voice, to a popular song of war- time--cheap, sentimental, but now tragically moving:  ""Just a Baby's Prayer at Twilight,""        "". . .",1
2650,"when lights are low. Poor baby's years""   Helen entered the darkening room. Are filled with tears. The fear had gone out of his eyes: above his gasping he looked gravely at her, scowling, with the old puzzled child's stare.",1
2651,"Then, in a moment of fluttering consciousness, he recognized her. He grinned beautifully, with the thin swift flicker of his mouth. Hello, Helen! It's Helen! he cried eagerly.",1
2652,"She came from the room with a writhen and contorted face, holding the sobs that shook her until she was half-way down the stairs. As darkness came upon the gray wet day, the family gathered in the parlor, in the last terrible congress before death, silent, waiting. Gant rocked petulantly, spitting into the fire, making a weak whining moan from time to time. One by one, at intervals, they left the room, mounting the stairs softly, and listening outside the door of the sick-room. And they heard Ben, as, with incessant humming repetition, like a child, he sang his song,        ""There's a mother there at twilight",1
2653,"Who's glad to know--""   Eliza sat stolidly, hands folded, before the parlor fire. Her dead white face had a curious carven look; the inflexible solidity of madness. Well,"" she said at length, slowly, ""you never know. Perhaps this is the crisis. Perhaps--"" her face hardened into granite again. She said no more.",1
2654,"Coker came in and went at once, without speaking, to the sick-room. Shortly before nine o'clock Bessie Gant came down. All right,"" she said quietly. You had all better come up now. This is the end. Eliza got up and marched out of the room with a stolid face.",1
2655,"Helen followed her: she was panting with hysteria, and had begun to wring her big hands. Now, get hold of yourself, Helen,"" said Bessie Gant warningly. This is no time to let yourself go. Eliza went steadily upstairs, making no noise.",1
2656,"But, as she neared the room, she paused, as if listening for sounds within. Faintly, in the silence, they heard Ben's song. And suddenly, casting away all pretense, Eliza staggered, and fell against the wall, turning her face into her hand, with a terrible wrenched cry:  ""O God!",1
2657,"If I had known! If I had known! Then, weeping with bitter unrestraint, with the contorted and ugly grimace of sorrow, mother and daughter embraced each other.",1
2658,"In a moment they composed themselves, and quietly entered the room. Eugene and Luke pulled Gant to his feet and supported him up the stairs. He sprawled upon them, moaning in long quivering exhalations.",1
2659,"Mer-ci-ful God! That I should have to bear this in my old age. That I should--""  ""Papa!",1
2660,For God's sake! Eugene cried sharply. Pull yourself together! It's Ben who's dying--not us! Let's try to behave decently to him for once. This served to quiet Gant for a moment.,1
2661,"But as he entered the room, and saw Ben lying in the semi-conscious coma that precedes death, the fear of his own death overcame him, and he began to moan again. They seated him in a chair, at the foot of the bed, and he rocked back and forth, weeping:  ""O Jesus! I can't bear it! Why must you put this upon me? I'm old and sick, and I don't know where the money's to come from. How are we ever going to face this fearful and croo-el winter? It'll cost a thousand dollars before we're through burying him, and I don't know where the money's to come from. He wept affectedly with sniffling sobs.",1
2662,"Hush! hush!"" cried Helen, rushing at him. In her furious anger, she seized him and shook him. You damned old man you, I could kill you! How dare you talk like that when your son's dying? I've wasted six years of my life nursing you, and you'll be the last one to go! In her blazing anger, she turned accusingly on Eliza:  ""You've done this to him.",1
2663,"You're the one that's responsible. If you hadn't pinched every penny he'd never have been like this. Yes, and Ben would be here, too! She panted for breath for a moment. Eliza made no answer. She did not hear her.",1
2664,"After this, I'm through! I've been looking for you to die--and Ben's the one who has to go. Her voice rose to a scream of exasperation. She shook Gant again. Never again! Do you hear that, you selfish old man? You've had everything--Ben's had nothing. And now he's the one to go. I hate you!""  ""Helen!  Helen!"" said Bessie Gant quietly.",1
2665,"Remember where you are. Yes, that means a lot to us,"" Eugene muttered bitterly. Then, over the ugly clamor of their dissension, over the rasp and snarl of their nerves, they heard the low mutter of Ben's expiring breath. The light had been re-shaded: he lay, like his own shadow, in all his fierce gray lonely beauty. And as they looked and saw his bright eyes already blurred with death, and saw the feeble beating flutter of his poor thin breast, the strange wonder, the dark rich miracle of his life surged over them its enormous loveliness. They grew quiet and calm, they plunged below all the splintered wreckage of their lives, they drew together in a superb communion of love and valiance, beyond horror and confusion, beyond death.",1
2666,"And Eugene's eyes grew blind with love and wonder: an enormous organ-music sounded in his heart, he possessed them for a moment, he was a part of their loveliness, his life soared magnificently out of the slough and pain and ugliness. He thought:  ""That was not all! That really was not all!",1
2667,"Helen turned quietly to Coker, who was standing in shadow by the window, chewing upon his long unlighted cigar. Is there nothing more you can do? Have you tried everything? I mean--EVERYTHING?""  Her voice was prayerful and low.",1
2668,"Coker turned toward her slowly, taking the cigar between his big stained fingers. Then, gently, with his weary yellow smile, he answered:  ""Everything. Not all the king's horses, not all the doctors and nurses in the world, can help him now. How long have you known this?"" she said.",1
2669,"For two days,"" he answered. From the beginning. He was silent for a moment. For ten years! he went on with growing energy. Since I first saw him, at three in the morning, in the Greasy Spoon, with a doughnut in one hand and a cigarette in the other. My dear, dear girl,"" he said gently as she tried to speak, ""we can't turn back the days that have gone. We can't turn life back to the hours when our lungs were sound, our blood hot, our bodies young. We are a flash of fire--a brain, a heart, a spirit. And we are three-cents-worth of lime and iron--which we cannot get back. He picked up his greasy black slouch hat, and jammed it carelessly upon his head.",1
2670,"Then he fumbled for a match and lit the chewed cigar. Has everything been done? she said again. I want to know! Is there anything left worth trying?""  He made a weary gesture of his arms.",1
2671,My dear girl! he said. He's drowning! Drowning! She stood frozen with the horror of his pronouncement.,1
2672,"Coker looked for a moment at the gray twisted shadow on the bed. Then, quietly, sadly, with tenderness and tired wonder, he said: ""Old Ben. When shall we see HIS like again?""  Then he went quietly out, the long cigar clamped firmly in his mouth.",1
2673,"In a moment, Bessie Gant, breaking harshly in upon their silence with ugly and triumphant matter-of-factness, said:  ""Well, it will be a relief to get this over. I'd rather be called into forty outside cases than one in which any of these damn relations are concerned. I'm dead for sleep. Helen turned quietly upon her.",1
2674,"Leave the room! she said. This is our affair now. We have the right to be left alone. Surprised, Bessie Gant stared at her for a moment with an angry, resentful face.",1
2675,"Then she left the room. The only sound in the room now was the low rattling mutter of Ben's breath. He no longer gasped; he no longer gave signs of consciousness or struggle. His eyes were almost closed; their gray flicker was dulled, coated with the sheen of insensibility and death. He lay quietly upon his back, very straight, without sign of pain, and with a curious upturned thrust of his sharp thin face. His mouth was firmly shut. Already, save for the feeble mutter of his breath, he seemed to be dead--he seemed detached, no part of the ugly mechanism of that sound which came to remind them of the terrible chemistry of flesh, to mock at illusion, at all belief in the strange passage and continuance of life.",1
2676,"He was dead, save for the slow running down of the worn-out machine, save for that dreadful mutter within him of which he was no part. He was dead. But in their enormous silence wonder grew. They remembered the strange flitting loneliness of his life, they thought of a thousand forgotten acts and moments--and always there was something that now seemed unearthly and strange: he walked through their lives like a shadow--they looked now upon his gray deserted shell with a thrill of awful recognition, as one who remembers a forgotten and enchanted word, or as men who look upon a corpse and see for the first time a departed god.",1
2677,"Luke, who had been standing at the foot of the bed, now turned to Eugene nervously, stammering in an unreal whisper of wonder and disbelief:  ""I g-g-g-guess Ben's gone. Gant had grown very quiet: he sat in the darkness at the foot of the bed, leaning forward upon his cane, escaped from the revery of his own approaching death, into the waste land of the past, blazing back sadly and poignantly the trail across the lost years that led to the birth of his strange son. Helen sat facing the bed, in the darkness near the windows. Her eyes rested not on Ben but on her mother's face. All by unspoken consent stood back in the shadows and let Eliza repossess the flesh to which she had given life.",1
2678,"And Eliza, now that he could deny her no longer, now that his fierce bright eyes could no longer turn from her in pain and aversion, sat near his head beside him, clutching his cold hand between her rough worn palms. She did not seem conscious of the life around her. She seemed under a powerful hypnosis: she sat very stiff and erect in her chair, her white face set stonily, her dull black eyes fixed upon the gray cold face.",1
2679,"They sat waiting. Midnight came. A cock crew. Eugene went quietly to a window and stood looking out. The great beast of night prowled softly about the house. The walls, the windows seemed to bend inward from the thrusting pressure of the dark. The low noise in the wasted body seemed almost to have stopped. It came infrequently, almost inaudibly, with a faint fluttering respiration.",1
2680,"Helen made a sign to Gant and Luke. They rose and went quietly out. At the door she paused, and beckoned to Eugene. He went to her.",1
2681,"You stay here with her,"" she said. You're her youngest. When it's over come and tell us. He nodded, and closed the door behind her.",1
2682,"When they had gone, he waited, listening for a moment. Then he went to where Eliza was sitting. He bent over her.",1
2683,"Mama! he whispered. Mama!""  She gave no sign that she had heard him.",1
2684,"Her face did not move; she did not turn her eyes from their fixed stare. Mama! he said more loudly. Mama!""  He touched her.",1
2685,"She made no response. Mama!  Mama!""  She sat there stiffly and primly like a little child. Swarming pity rose in him. Gently, desperately, he tried to detach her fingers from Ben's hand. Her rough clasp on the cold hand tightened. Then, slowly, stonily, from right to left, without expression, she shook her head.",1
2686,"He fell back, beaten, weeping, before that implacable gesture. Suddenly, with horror, he saw that she was watching her own death, that the unloosening grip of her hand on Ben's hand was an act of union with her own flesh, that, for her, Ben was not dying--but that a part of HER, of HER life, HER blood, HER body, was dying. Part of her, the younger, the lovelier, the better part, coined in her flesh, borne and nourished and begun with so much pain there twenty-six years before, and forgotten since, was dying.",1
2687,"Eugene stumbled to the other side of the bed and fell upon his knees. He began to pray. He did not believe in God, nor in Heaven or Hell, but he was afraid they might be true. He did not believe in angels with soft faces and bright wings, but he believed in the dark spirits that hovered above the heads of lonely men. He did not believe in devils or angels, but he believed in Ben's bright demon to whom he had seen him speak so many times.",1
2688,"Eugene did not believe in these things, but he was afraid they might be true. He was afraid that Ben would get lost again. He felt that no one but he could pray for Ben now: that the dark union of their spirits made only HIS prayers valid. All that he had read in books, all the tranquil wisdom he had professed so glibly in his philosophy course, and the great names of Plato and Plotinus, of Spinoza and Immanuel Kant, of Hegel and Descartes, left him now, under the mastering surge of his wild Celtic superstition. He felt that he must pray frantically as long as the little ebbing flicker of breath remained in his brother's body.",1
2689,"So, with insane sing-song repetition, he began to mutter over and over again:  ""Whoever You Are, be good to Ben  to-night. Show him the way . . . Whoever You Are, be good to Ben to-night. Show him the way . . . He lost count of the minutes, the hours: he heard only the feeble rattle of dying breath, and his wild synchronic prayer.",1
2690,"Light faded from his brain, and consciousness. Fatigue and powerful nervous depletion conquered him. He sprawled out on the floor, with his arms pillowed on the bed, muttering drowsily. Eliza, unmoving, sat across the bed, holding Ben's hand. Eugene, mumbling, sank into an uneasy sleep.",1
2691,"He awoke suddenly, conscious that he had slept, with a sharp quickening of horror. He was afraid that the little fluttering breath had now ceased entirely, that the effect of his prayer was lost. The body on the bed was almost rigid: there was no sound. Then, unevenly, without rhythm, there was a faint mutter of breath. He knew it was the end. He rose quickly and ran to the door. Across the hall, in a cold bedroom, on two wide beds, Gant, Luke, and Helen lay exhausted.",1
2692,"Come,"" cried Eugene. He's going now. They came quickly into the room.",1
2693,"Eliza sat unmoving, oblivious of them. As they entered the room, they heard, like a faint expiring sigh, the final movement of breath. The rattling in the wasted body, which seemed for hours to have given over to death all of life that is worth saving, had now ceased. The body appeared to grow rigid before them. Slowly, after a moment, Eliza withdrew her hands. But suddenly, marvellously, as if his resurrection and rebirth had come upon him, Ben drew upon the air in a long and powerful respiration; his gray eyes opened. Filled with a terrible vision of all death to the dark spirit who had brooded upon each footstep of his pillows without support--a flame, a light, a glory--joined at length in death to the dark spirit who had brooded upon each footstep of his lonely adventure on earth; and, casting the fierce sword of his glance with utter and final comprehension upon the room haunted with its gray pageantry of cheap loves and dull consciences and on all those uncertain mummers of waste and confusion fading now from the bright window of his eyes, he passed instantly, scornful and unafraid, as he had lived, into the shades of death.",1
2694,"We can believe in the nothingness of life, we can believe in the nothingness of death and of life after death--but who can believe in the nothingness of Ben? Like Apollo, who did his penance to the high god in the sad house of King Admetus, he came, a god with broken feet, into the gray hovel of this world. And he lived here a stranger, trying to recapture the music of the lost world, trying to recall the great forgotten language, the lost faces, the stone, the leaf, the door.",1
2695,"O Artemidorus, farewell! 36   In that enormous silence, where pain and darkness met, some birds were waking. It was October. It was almost four o'clock in the morning. Eliza straightened out Ben's limbs, and folded his hands across his body. She smoothed out the rumpled covers of the bed, and patted out the pillows, making a smooth hollow for his head to rest in. His flashing hair, cropped close to his well-shaped head, was crisp and crinkly as a boy's, and shone with bright points of light. With a pair of scissors, she snipped off a little lock where it would not show.",1
2696,"Grover's was black as a raven's without a kink in it. You'd never have known they were twins,"" she said. They went downstairs to the kitchen.",1
2697,"Well, Eliza,"" said Gant, calling her by name for the first time in thirty years, ""you've had a hard life. If I'd acted different, we might have got along together. Let's try to make the most of what time's left. Nobody is blaming you. Taking it all in all, you've done pretty well. There are a great many things I'd like to do over again,"" said Eliza gravely.",1
2698,"She shook her head. We never know. We'll talk about it some other time,"" said Helen.",1
2699,"I guess every one is worn out. I know I am. I'm going to get some sleep. Papa, go on to bed, in heaven's name! There's nothing you can do now. Mama, I think you'd better go, too--""  ""No,"" said Eliza, shaking her head.",1
2700,"You children go on. I couldn't sleep now anyway. There are too many things to do. I'm going to call up John Hines now. 'Tell him,"" said Gant, ""to spare no expense.",1
2701,"I'll foot the bills. Well,"" said Helen, ""whatever it costs, let's give Ben a good funeral. It's the last thing we can ever do for him. I want to have no regrets on that score. Yes,"" said Eliza, nodding slowly.",1
2702,"I want the best one that money will buy. I'll make arrangements with John Hines when I talk to him. You children go on to bed now. Poor old 'Gene,"" said Helen, laughing.",1
2703,"He looks like the last rose of summer. He's worn out. You pile in and get some sleep, honey. No,"" he said, ""I'm hungry.",1
2704,"I haven't had anything to eat since I left the university. Well, for G-G-G-God's sake! Luke stuttered. Why didn't you speak, idiot? I'd have got you something. Come on,"" he said, grinning. I wouldn't mind a bite myself. Let's go uptown and eat. Yes,"" said Eugene.",1
2705,"I'd like to get out for a while from the bosom of the family circle. They laughed crazily. He poked around the stove for a moment, peering into the oven.",1
2706,"Huh?  Hah? What are you after, boy?"" said Eliza suspiciously. What you got good to eat, Miss Eliza?"" he said, leering crazily at her. He looked at the sailor: they burst into loud idiot laughter, pronging each other in the ribs. Eugene picked up a coffee-pot half-filled with a cold weak wash, and sniffed at it.",1
2707,"By God! he said. That's one thing Ben's out of. He won't have to drink mama's coffee any more. Whah-whah-whah!"" said the sailor.",1
2708,"Gant grinned, wetting a thumb. You ought to be ashamed of yourself,"" said Helen, with a hoarse snigger. Poor old Ben!""  ""Why, what's wrong with that coffee?"" said Eliza, vexed.",1
2709,It's GOOD coffee. They howled. Eliza pursed her lips for a moment.,1
2710,"I don't like that way of talking, boy,"" she said. Her eyes blurred suddenly. Eugene seized her rough hand and kissed it.",1
2711,"It's all right, mama! he said. It's all right. I didn't mean it! He put his arms around her. She wept, suddenly and bitterly.",1
2712,"Nobody ever knew him. He never told us about himself. He was the quiet one. I've lost them both now. Then, drying her eyes, she added:  ""You boys go get something to eat.",1
2713,"A little walk will do you good. And, say,"" she added, ""why don't you go by The Citizen office? They ought to be told. They've been calling up every day to find out about him. They thought a lot of that boy,"" said Gant.",1
2714,"They were tired, but they all felt an enormous relief. For over a day, each had known that death was inevitable, and after the horror of the incessant strangling gasp, this peace, this end of pain touched them all with a profound, a weary joy. Well, Ben's gone,"" said Helen slowly. Her eyes were wet, but she wept quietly now, with gentle grief, with love. I'm glad it's over. Poor old Ben!  I never got to know him until these last few days. He was the best of the lot. Thank God, he's out of it now. Eugene thought of death now, with love, with joy.",1
2715,"Death was like a lovely and tender woman, Ben's friend and lover, who had come to free him, to heal him, to save him from the torture of life. They stood there together, without speaking, in Eliza's littered kitchen, and their eyes were blind with tears, because they thought of lovely and delicate death, and because they loved one another. Eugene and Luke went softly up the hall, and out into the dark. Gently, they closed the big front door behind them, and descended the veranda steps. In that enormous silence, birds were waking. It was a little after four o'clock in the morning. Wind pressed the boughs. It was still dark. But above them the thick clouds that had covered the earth for days with a dreary gray blanket had been torn open. Eugene looked up through the deep ragged vault of the sky and saw the proud and splendid stars, bright and unwinking. The withered leaves were shaking.",1
2716,"A cock crew his shrill morning cry of life beginning and awaking. The cock that crew at midnight (thought Eugene) had an elfin ghostly cry. His crow was drugged with sleep and death: it was like a far horn sounding under sea; and it was a warning to all the men who are about to die, and to the ghosts that must go home.",1
2717,"But the cock that crows at morning (he thought), has a voice as shrill as any fife. It says, we are done with sleep. We are done with death. O waken, waken into life, says his voice as shrill as any fife. In that enormous silence, birds were waking.",1
2718,"He heard the cock's bright minstrelsy again, and by the river in the dark, the great thunder of flanged wheels, and the long retreating wail of the whistle. And slowly, up the chill deserted street, he heard the heavy ringing clangor of shod hoofs. In that enormous silence, life was waking.",1
2719,"Joy awoke in him, and exultation. They had escaped from the prison of death; they were joined to the bright engine of life again. Life, ruddered life, that would not fail, began its myriad embarkations.",1
2720,"A paper-boy came briskly, with the stiff hobbled limp that Eugene knew so well, down the centre of the street, hurling a blocked paper accurately upon the porch of the Brunswick. As he came opposite Dixieland, he moved in to the curb, tossing his fresh paper with a careful plop. He knew there was sickness in the house.",1
2721,The withered leaves were shaking. Eugene jumped to the sidewalk from the sodded yard. He stopped the carrier.,1
2722,"What's your name, boy?"" he said. Tyson Smathers,"" said the boy, turning upon him a steady Scotch- Irish face that was full of life and business. My name is 'Gene Gant. Did you ever hear of me?""  ""Yes,"" said Tyson Smathers, ""I've heard of you.",1
2723,"You had number 7.""  ""That was a long time ago,"" said Eugene, pompously, grinning. I was just a boy. In that enormous silence, birds were waking.",1
2724,"He thrust his hand into a pocket and found a dollar-bill. Here,"" he said. I carried the damn things once. Next to my brother Ben, I was the best boy they ever had. Merry Christmas, Tyson.""  ""It ain't Christmas yet,"" said Tyson Smathers.",1
2725,"You're right, Tyson,"" said Eugene, ""but it will be. Tyson Smathers took the money, with a puzzled, freckled grin. Then he went on down the street, throwing papers.",1
2726,"The maples were thin and sere. Their rotting leaves covered the ground. But the trees were not leafless yet. The leaves were quaking. Some birds began to chatter in the trees. Wind pressed the boughs, the withered leaves were shaking. It was October.",1
2727,"As Luke and Eugene turned up the street toward town, a woman came out of the big brick house across the street, and over the yard toward them. When she got near, they saw she was Mrs. Pert. It was October, but some birds were waking.",1
2728,"Luke,"" she said fuzzily. Luke?  Is it Old Luke?""  ""Yes,"" said Luke. And 'Gene? Is it old 'Gene? She laughed gently, patting his hand, peering comically at him with her bleared oaken eyes, and swaying back and forth gravely, with alcoholic dignity. The leaves, the withered leaves, were shaking, quaking. It was October, and the leaves were shaking.",1
2729,"They ran old Fatty away, 'Gene,"" she said. They won't let her come in the house any more. They ran her away because she liked Old Ben.  Ben.  Old Ben. She swayed gently, vaguely collecting her thought. Old Ben. How's Old Ben, 'Gene?"" she coaxed. Fatty wants to know. I'm m-m-m-mighty sorry, Mrs. P-P-P-Pert . . .",1
2730,"Luke began. Wind pressed the boughs, the withered leaves were quaking. Ben's dead,"" said Eugene.",1
2731,"She stared at him for a moment, swaying on her feet  ""Fatty liked Ben,"" she said gently, in a moment. Fatty and Old Ben were friends. She turned and started unsteadily across the street, holding one hand out gravely, for balance.",1
2732,"In that enormous silence, birds were waking. It was October, but some birds were waking. Then Luke and Eugene walked swiftly townward, filled with great joy because they heard the sounds of life and daybreak. And as they walked, they spoke often of Ben, with laughter, with old pleasant memory, speaking of him not as of one who had died, but as of a brother who had been gone for years, and was returning home. They spoke of him with triumph and tenderness, as of one who had defeated pain, and had joyously escaped. Eugene's mind groped awkwardly about. It fumbled like a child, with little things.",1
2733,"They were filled with a deep and tranquil affection for each other: they talked without constraint, without affectation, with quiet confidence and knowledge. Do you remember,"" Luke began, ""the t-t-t-time he cut the hair of Aunt Pett's orphan boy--Marcus?""  ""He--used--a chamber-pot--to trim the edges,"" Eugene screamed, waking the street with wild laughter. They walked along hilariously, greeting a few early pedestrians with ironical obsequiousness, jeering pleasantly at the world in brotherly alliance. Then they entered the relaxed and weary offices of the paper which Ben had served so many years, and gave their stick of news to the tired man there.",1
2734,"There was regret, a sense of wonder, in that office where the swift record of so many days had died--a memory that would not die, of something strange and passing. Damn!  I'm sorry! He was a great boy! said the men.",1
2735,"As light broke grayly in the empty streets, and the first car rattled up to town, they entered the little beanery where he had spent, in smoke and coffee, so many hours of daybreak. Eugene looked in and saw them there, assembled as they had been many years before, like the nightmare ratification of a prophecy: McGuire, Coker, the weary counter-man, and, at the lower end, the press-man, Harry Tugman. Luke and Eugene entered, and sat down at the counter.",1
2736,"Gentlemen, gentlemen,"" said Luke sonorously. Hello, Luke,"" barked McGuire. Do you think you'll ever have any sense? How are you, son? How's school? he said to Eugene. He stared at them for a moment, his wet cigarette plastered comically on his full sag lip, his bleared eyes kindly and drunken.",1
2737,"General, how's the boy? What're you drinking these days-- turpentine or varnish?"" said the sailor, tweaking him roughly in his larded ribs. McGuire grunted.",1
2738,"Is it over, son?"" said Coker quietly. Yes,"" said Eugene. Coker took the long cigar from his mouth and grinned malarially at the boy.",1
2739,"Feel better, don't you, son?"" he said. Yes,"" said Eugene. A hell of a lot. Well, Eugenics,"" said the sailor briskly, ""what are you eating?""  ""What's the man got?"" said Eugene, staring at the greasy card.",1
2740,"Have you got any young roast whale left?""  ""No,"" said the counter-man. We did have some, but we run out. How about the fricasseed bull?"" said Luke.",1
2741,"Have you got any of that?""  ""You don't need any one to fricassee your bull, son,"" said McGuire. You've got plenty as it is. Their bull-laughter bellowed in the beanery.",1
2742,"With puckered forehead, Luke stuttered over the menu. F-f-f-fried chicken a la Maryland,"" he muttered. A la Maryland?"" he repeated as if puzzled. Now, ain't that nice?"" he said, looking around with mincing daintiness.",1
2743,"Bring me one of your this week's steaks,"" said Eugene, ""well done, with a meat-axe and the sausage-grinder. What do you want the sausage-grinder for, son?"" said Coker. That's for the mince pie,"" said Eugene.",1
2744,"Make it two,"" said Luke, ""with a coupla cups of Mock-a, just like mother still makes. He looked crazily around at Eugene, and burst into loud whah-whahs, prodding him in the ribs. Where they got you stationed now, Luke?"" said Harry Tugman, peering up snoutily from a mug of coffee.",1
2745,"At the p-p-p-present time in Norfolk at the Navy Base,"" Luke answered, ""m-m-making the world safe for hypocrisy. Do you ever get out to sea, son?"" said Coker. Sure!"" said Luke. A f-f-five cent ride on the street-car brings me right out to the beach. That boy has had the makings of a sailor in him ever since he wet the bed,"" said McGuire.",1
2746,"I predicted it long ago. Horse Hines came in briskly, but checked himself when he saw the two young men. Look out! whispered the sailor to Eugene, with a crazy grin. You're next! He's got his fishy eye glued on you. He's already getting you measured up for one. Eugene looked angrily around at Horse Hines, muttering.",1
2747,"The sailor chortled madly. Good-morning, gentlemen,"" said Horse Hines, in an accent of refined sadness. Boys,"" he said, coming up to them sorrowfully, ""I was mighty sorry to hear of your trouble. I couldn't have thought more of that boy if he'd been my own brother. Don't go on, Horse,"" said McGuire, holding up four fat fingers of protest.",1
2748,"We can see you're heart-broken. If you go on, you may get hysterical with your grief, and break right out laughing. We couldn't bear that, Horse. We're big strong men, but we've had hard lives. I beg of you to spare us, Horse. Horse Hines did not notice him.",1
2749,"I've got him over at the place now,"" he said softly. I want you boys to come in later in the day to see him. You won't know he's the same person when I'm through. God!",1
2750,"An improvement over nature,"" said Coker. His mother will appreciate it. Is this an undertaking shop you're running, Horse,"" said McGuire, ""or a beauty parlor?",1
2751,"We know you'll d-d-do your best, Mr. Hines,"" said the sailor with ready earnest insincerity. That's the reason the family got you. Ain't you goin' to eat the rest of your steak?"" said the counter- man to Eugene.",1
2752,"Steak!  Steak! It's not steak! muttered Eugene. I know what it is now. He got off the stool and walked over to Coker. Can you save me? Am I going to die? Do I look sick, Coker?"" he said in a hoarse mutter.",1
2753,"No, son,"" said Coker. Not sick--crazy. Horse Hines took his seat at the other end of the counter.  Eugene, leaning upon the greasy marble counter, began to sing:        ""Hey, ho, the carrion crow,       Derry, derry, derry, derr--oh!""   ""Shut up, you damn fool!",1
2754,"said the sailor in a hoarse whisper, grinning. A carrion crow sat on a rock,       Derry, derry, derry, derr--oh!""    Outside, in the young gray light, there was a brisk wakening of life. A street-car curved slowly into the avenue, the motorman leaning from his window and shifting the switch carefully with a long rod, blowing the warm fog of his breath into the chill air. Patrolman Leslie Roberts, sallow and liverish, slouched by anæmically, swinging his club. The negro man-of-all-work for Wood's Pharmacy walked briskly into the post-office to collect the morning mail. J. T. Stearns, the railway passenger-agent, waited on the curb across the street for the depot car. He had a red face, and he was reading the morning paper.",1
2755,"There they go! Eugene cried suddenly. As if they didn't know about it!""  ""Luke,"" said Harry Tugman, looking up from his paper, ""I was certainly sorry to hear about Ben.",1
2756,"He was one fine boy. Then he went back to his sheet. By God!"" said Eugene. This is news!""  He burst into a fit of laughter, gasping and uncontrollable, which came from him with savage violence.",1
2757,"Horse Hines glanced craftily up at him. Then he went back to his paper. The two young men left the lunch-room and walked homeward through the brisk morning. Eugene's mind kept fumbling with little things. There was a frosty snap and clatter of life upon the streets, the lean rattle of wheels, the creak of blinds, a cold rose-tint of pearled sky. In the Square, the motormen stood about among their cars, in loud foggy gossip. At Dixieland, there was an air of exhaustion, of nervous depletion. The house slept; Eliza alone was stirring, but she had a smart fire crackling in the range, and was full of business.",1
2758,You children go and sleep now. We've all got work to do later in the day. Luke and Eugene went into the big dining-room which Eliza had converted into a bed-room.,1
2759,"D-d-d-damn if I'm going to sleep upstairs,"" said the sailor angrily. Not after this!""  ""Pshaw!"" said Eliza. That's only superstition. It wouldn't bother me a bit. The brothers slept heavily until past noon.",1
2760,"Then they went out again to see Horse Hines. They found him with his legs comfortably disposed on the desk of his dark little office, with its odor of weeping ferns, and incense, and old carnations. He got up quickly as they entered, with a starchy crackle of his hard boiled shirt, and a solemn rustle of his black garments. Then he began to speak to them in a hushed voice, bending forward slightly.",1
2761,"How like Death this man is (thought Eugene). He thought of the awful mysteries of burial--the dark ghoul-ritual, the obscene communion with the dead, touched with some black and foul witch- magic. Where is the can in which they throw the parts? There is a restaurant near here. Then he took the cold phthisic hand, freckled on its back, that the man extended, with a sense of having touched something embalmed. The undertaker's manner had changed since the morning: it had become official, professional. He was the alert marshal of their grief, the efficient master-of- ceremonies. Subtly he made them feel there was an order and decorum in death: a ritual of mourning that must be observed. They were impressed.",1
2762,"We thought we'd like to s-s-s-see you f-f-f-first, Mr. Hines, about the c-c-c-c-casket,"" Luke whispered nervously. We're going to ask your advice. We want you to help us find something appropriate. Horse Hines nodded with grave approval.",1
2763,"Then he led them softly back, into a large dark room with polished waxen floors where, amid a rich dead smell of wood and velvet, upon wheeled trestles, the splendid coffins lay in their proud menace. Now,"" said Horse Hines quietly, ""I know the family doesn't want anything cheap. No, sir!"" said the sailor positively.",1
2764,"We want the b-b-b-best you have. I take a personal interest in this funeral,"" said Horse Hines with gentle emotion. I have known the Gant and Pentland families for thirty years or more. I have had business dealings with your father for nigh on to twenty years. And I w-w-want you to know, Mr. Hines, that the f-f-f-family appreciates the interest you're taking in this,"" said the sailor very earnestly.",1
2765,"He likes this, Eugene thought. The affection of the world. He must have it.",1
2766,"Your father,"" continued Horse Hines, ""is one of the oldest and most respected business men in the community. And the Pentland family is one of the wealthiest and most prominent. Eugene was touched with a moment's glow of pride.",1
2767,"You don't want anything shoddy,"" said Horse Hines. I know that. What you get ought to be in good taste and have dignity. Am I right?""  Luke nodded emphatically.",1
2768,"That's the way we feel about it, Mr. Hines. We want the best you have. We're not pinching p-p-p-pennies where Ben's concerned,"" he said proudly.",1
2769,"Well, then,"" said Horse Hines, ""I'll give you my honest opinion. I could give you this one cheap,"" he placed his hand upon one of the caskets, ""but I don't think it's what you want. Of course,"" he said, ""it's good at the price. It's worth the money. It'll give you service, don't worry. You'll get value out of it--""  Now there's an idea, thought Eugene.",1
2770,"They're all good, Luke. I haven't got a bad piece of stock in the place. But--""  ""We want something b-b-b-better,"" said Luke earnestly.",1
2771,"He turned to Eugene. Don't you think so, 'Gene?""  ""Yes,"" said Eugene. Well,"" said Horse Hines, ""I could sell you this one,"" he indicated the most sumptuous casket in the room. They don't come better than that, Luke. That's the top. She's worth every dollar I ask for her. All right,"" said Luke.",1
2772,"You're the judge. If that's the best you've g-g-g-got, we'll take it. No, no! thought Eugene.",1
2773,"You mustn't interrupt. Let him go on. But,"" said Horse Hines relentlessly, ""there's no need for you to take that one, either. What you're after, Luke, is dignity and simplicity. Is that right?""  ""Yes,"" said the sailor meekly, ""I guess you're right at that, Mr. Hines.",1
2774,"Now we'll have it, thought Eugene. This man takes joy in his work. Well, then,"" said Horse Hines decisively, ""I was going to suggest to you boys that you take this one. He put his hand affectionately upon a handsome casket at his side.",1
2775,"This is neither too plain nor too fancy. It's simple and in good taste. Silver handles, you see--silver plate here for the name. You can't go wrong on this one. It's a good buy. She'll give you value for every dollar you put into it. They walked around the coffin, staring at it critically.",1
2776,"After a moment, Luke said nervously:  ""How--wh--wh--wh-what's the price of this one?""  ""That sells for $450,"" said Horse Hines. But,"" he added, after a moment's dark reflection, ""I'll tell you what I'll do. Your father and I are old friends. Out of respect for the family, I'll let you have it at cost--$375. What do you say, 'Gene?",1
2777,"the sailor asked. Does it look all right to you?""  Do your Christmas shopping early. Yes,"" said Eugene, ""let's take it. I wish there were another color. I don't like black,"" he added. Haven't you got any other color? Horse Hines stared at him a moment.",1
2778,"Black IS the color,"" he said. Then, after a moment's silence, he went on:  ""Would you boys care to see the body?""  ""Yes,"" they said. He led them on tiptoe down the aisle of the coffins, and opened a door to a room behind. It was dark. They entered and stood with caught breath. Horse Hines switched on a light and closed the door.",1
2779,"Ben, clad in his best suit of clothes, a neat one of dark gray- black, lay in rigid tranquillity upon a table. His hands, cold and white, with clean dry nails, withered a little like an old apple, were crossed loosely on his stomach. He had been closely shaved: he was immaculately groomed. The rigid head was thrust sharply upward, with a ghastly counterfeit of a smile: there was a little gum of wax at the nostrils, and a waxen lacing between the cold firm lips. The mouth was tight, somewhat bulging. It looked fuller than it ever had looked before.",1
2780,"There was a faint indefinably cloying odor. The sailor looked with superstition, nervously, with puckered forehead. Then he whispered to Eugene:  ""I g-g-guess that's Ben, all right.",1
2781,"Because, Eugene thought, it is not Ben, and we are lost. He looked at the cold bright carrion, that bungling semblance which had not even the power of a good wax-work to suggest its image. Nothing of Ben could be buried here. In this poor stuffed crow, with its pathetic bartering, and its neat buttons, nothing of the owner had been left. All that was there was the tailoring of Horse Hines, who now stood by, watchfully, hungry for their praise.",1
2782,"No, this is not Ben (Eugene thought). No trace of him is left in this deserted shell. It bears no mark of him. Where has he gone? Is this his bright particular flesh, made in his image, given life by his unique gesture, by his one soul? No, he is gone from that bright flesh. This thing is one with all carrion; it will be mixed with the earth again. Ben?  Where? O lost!",1
2783,"The sailor, looking, said:  ""That b-b-b-boy sure suffered. Suddenly, turning his face away into his hand, he sobbed briefly and painfully, his confused stammering life drawn out of its sprawl into a moment of hard grief. Eugene wept, not because he saw Ben there, but because Ben had gone, and because he remembered all the tumult and the pain.",1
2784,"It is over now,"" said Horse Hines gently. He is at peace. By God, Mr. Hines,"" said the sailor earnestly, as he wiped his eyes on his jacket, ""that was one g-g-great boy.",1
2785,"Horse Hines looked raptly at the cold strange face. A fine boy,"" he murmured as his fish-eye fell tenderly on his work. And I have tried to do him justice. They were silent for a moment, looking.",1
2786,"You've d-d-done a fine job,"" said the sailor. I've got to hand it to you. What do you say, 'Gene?""  ""Yes,"" said Eugene, in a small choking voice.",1
2787,"Yes.""  ""He's a b-b-b-bit p-p-p-pale, don't you think? the sailor stammered, barely conscious of what he was saying. Just a moment!"" said Horse Hines quickly, lifting a finger. Briskly he took a stick of rouge from his pocket, stepped forward, and deftly, swiftly, sketched upon the dead gray cheeks a ghastly rose-hued mockery of life and health.",1
2788,"There!"" he said, with deep satisfaction; and, rouge-stick in hand, head critically cocked, like a painter before his canvas, he stepped back into the terrible staring prison of their horror. There are artists, boys, in every profession,"" Horse Hines continued in a moment, with quiet pride, ""and though I do say it myself, Luke, I'm proud of my work on this job. Look at him! he exclaimed with sudden energy, and a bit of color in his gray face. Did you ever see anything more natural in your life? Eugene turned upon the man a grim and purple stare, noting with pity, with a sort of tenderness, as the dogs of laughter tugged at his straining throat the earnestness and pride in the long horse- face.",1
2789,"Look at it! said Horse Hines again in slow wonder. I'll never beat that again! Not if I live to be a million! That's art, boys!",1
2790,"A slow strangling gurgle escaped from Eugene's screwed lips. The sailor looked quickly at him, with a crazy suppressed smile. What's the matter? he said warningly. Don't, fool! His grin broke loose.",1
2791,"Eugene staggered across the floor and collapsed upon a chair, roaring with laughter while his long arms flapped helplessly at his sides. Scuse! he gasped. Don't mean to--A-r-rt! Yes! Yes! That's it! he screamed, and he beat his knuckles in a crazy tattoo upon the polished floor. He slid gently off the chair, slowly unbuttoning his vest, and with a languid hand loosening his necktie. A faint gurgle came from his weary throat, his head lolled around on the floor languidly, tears coursed down his swollen features.",1
2792,"What's wrong with you?  Are you c-c-c-crazy?"" said the sailor, all a-grin. Horse Hines bent sympathetically and assisted the boy to his feet. It's the strain,"" he said knowingly to the sailor. The pore fellow has become hysterical. 37   So, to Ben dead was given more care, more time, more money than had ever been given to Ben living.",1
2793,"His burial was a final gesture of irony and futility: an effort to compensate carrion death for the unpaid wage of life--love and mercy. He had a grand funeral. All the Pentlands sent wreaths, and came with their separate clans, bringing along with their hastily assumed funeral manners a smell of recent business. Will Pentland talked with the men about politics, the war, and trade conditions, paring his nails thoughtfully, pursing his lips and nodding in his curiously reflective way, and occasionally punning with a birdy wink. His pleased self-laughter was mixed with Henry's loud guffaw. Pett, older, kinder, gentler than Eugene had ever seen her, moved about with a rustling of gray silk, and a relaxed bitterness. And Jim was there, with his wife, whose name Eugene forgot, and his four bright hefty daughters, whose names he confused, but who had all been to college and done well, and his son, who had been to a Presbyterian college, and had been expelled for advocating free love and socialism while editor of the college paper. Now he played the violin, and loved music, and helped his father with the business: he was an effeminate and mincing young man, but of the breed. And there was Thaddeus Pentland, Will's bookkeeper, the youngest and poorest of the three. He was a man past fifty, with a pleasant red face, brown mustaches, and a gentle placid manner. He was full of puns and pleased good-nature, save when he quoted from Karl Marx and Eugene Debs. He was a Socialist, and had once received eight votes for Congress. He was there with his garrulous wife (whom Helen called Jibber-Jibber) and his two daughters, languid good-looking blondes of twenty and twenty-four.",1
2794,"There they were, in all their glory--that strange rich clan, with its fantastic mixture of success and impracticality, its hard monied sense, its visionary fanaticism. There they were, in their astonishing contradictions: the business man who had no business method, and yet had made his million dollars; the frantic antagonist of Capital who had given the loyal service of a lifetime to the thing he denounced; the wastrel son, with the bull vitality of the athlete, a great laugh, animal charm--no more; the musician son, a college rebel, intelligent, fanatic, with a good head for figures; insane miserliness for oneself, lavish expenditure for one's children. There they were, each with the familiar marking of the clan--broad nose, full lips, deep flat cheeks, deliberate pursed mouths, flat drawling voices, flat complacent laughter. There they were, with their enormous vitality, their tainted blood, their meaty health, their sanity, their insanity, their humor, their superstition, their meanness, their generosity, their fanatic idealism, their unyielding materialism. There they were, smelling of the earth and Parnassus--that strange clan which met only at weddings or funerals, but which was forever true to itself, indissoluble and forever apart, with its melancholia, its madness, its mirth: more enduring than life, more strong than death.",1
2795,"And as Eugene looked, he felt again the nightmare horror of destiny: he was of them--there was no escape. Their lust, their weakness, their sensuality, their fanaticism, their strength, their rich taint, were rooted in the marrow of his bones. But Ben, with the thin gray face (he thought) was not a part of them. Their mark was nowhere on him.",1
2796,"And among them, sick and old, leaning upon his cane, moved Gant, the alien, the stranger. He was lost and sorrowful, but sometimes, with a flash of his old rhetoric, he spoke of his grief and the death of his son. The women filled the house with their moaning. Eliza wept almost constantly; Helen by fits, in loose hysterical collapse. And all the other women wept with gusto, comforting Eliza and her daughter, falling into one another's arms, wailing with keen hunger. And the men stood sadly about, dressed in their good clothes, wondering when it would be over. Ben lay in the parlor, bedded in his expensive coffin. The room was heavy with the incense of the funeral bowers.",1
2797,"Presently the Scotch minister arrived: his decent soul lay above all the loud posturings of grief like a bolt of hard clean wool. He began the service for the dead in a dry nasal voice, remote, monotonous, cold, and passionate. Then, marshalled by Horse Hines, the pallbearers, young men from the paper and the town, who had known the dead man best, moved slowly out, gripping the coffin-handles with their nicotined fingers. In proper sequence, the mourners followed, lengthening out in closed victorias that exhaled their funeral scent of stale air and old leather.",1
2798,"To Eugene came again the old ghoul fantasy of a corpse and cold pork, the smell of the dead and hamburger steak--the glozed corruption of Christian burial, the obscene pomps, the perfumed carrion. Slightly nauseated, he took his seat with Eliza in the carriage, and tried to think of supper. The procession moved off briskly to the smooth trotting pull of the velvet rumps. The mourning women peered out of the closed carriages at the gaping town. They wept behind their heavy veils, and looked to see if the town was watching. Behind the world's great mask of grief, the eyes of the mourners shone through with a terrible and indecent hunger, an unnameable lust.",1
2799,"It was raw October weather--gray and wet. The service had been short, as a precaution against the pestilence which was everywhere. The funeral entered the cemetery. It was a pleasant place, on a hill. There was a good view of the town. As the hearse drove up, two men who had been digging the grave, moved off. The women moaned loudly when they saw the raw open ditch.",1
2800,"Slowly the coffin was lowered onto the bands that crossed the grave. Again Eugene heard the nasal drone of the Presbyterian minister. The boy's mind fumbled at little things. Horse Hines bent ceremoniously, with a starched crackle of shirt, to throw his handful of dirt into the grave. Ashes to ashes--""  He reeled and would have fallen in if Gilbert Gant had not held him. He had been drinking. I am the resurrection and the life-- Helen wept constantly, harshly and bitterly. He that believeth in me-- The sobs of the women rose to sharp screams as the coffin slid down upon the bands into the earth.",1
2801,"Then the mourners got back into their carriages and were driven briskly away. There was a fast indecent hurry about their escape. The long barbarism of burial was at an end. As they drove away, Eugene peered back through the little glass in the carriage. The two grave-diggers were already returning to their work. He watched until the first shovel of dirt had been thrown into the grave. He saw the raw new graves, the sere long grasses, noted how quickly the mourning wreaths had wilted. Then he looked at the wet gray sky. He hoped it would not rain that night.",1
2802,"It was over. The carriages split away from the procession. The men dropped off in the town at the newspaper office, the pharmacy, the cigar-store. The women went home. No more. No more.",1
2803,"Night came, the bare swept streets, the gaunt winds. Helen lay before a fire in Hugh Barton's home. She had a bottle of chloroform liniment in her hand. She brooded morbidly into the fire, reliving the death a hundred times, weeping bitterly and becoming calm again.",1
2804,"When I think of it, I hate her. I shall never forget. And did you hear her? Did you? Already she's begun to pretend how much he loved her. But you can't fool me! I know! He wouldn't have her around. You saw that, didn't you? He kept calling for me. I was the only one he'd let come near him. You know that, don't you?""  ""You're the one who always has to be the goat,"" said Hugh Barton sourly.",1
2805,"I'm getting tired of it. That's what has worn you out. If they don't leave you alone, I'm going to take you away from here. Then he went back to his charts and pamphlets, frowning importantly over a cigar, and scrawling figures on an old envelope with a stub of pencil gripped between his fingers.",1
2806,"She has him trained, too, Eugene thought. Then, hearing the sharp whine of the wind, she wept again. Poor old Ben,"" she said. I can't bear to think of him out there to-night. She was silent for a moment, staring at the fire.",1
2807,"After this, I'm through,"" she said. They can get along for themselves. Hugh and I have a right to our own lives. Don't you think so?""  ""Yes,"" said Eugene.",1
2808,"I'm merely the chorus, he thought. Papa's not going to die,"" she went on. I've nursed him like a slave for six years, and he'll be here when I'm gone. Every one was expecting papa to die, but it was Ben who went. You never can tell. After this, I'm through. Her voice had a note of exasperation in it.",1
2809,"They all felt the grim trickery of Death, which had come in by the cellar while they waited at the window. Papa has no right to expect it of me! she burst out resentfully. He's had his life. He's an old man. We have a right to ours as well as any one. Good heavens! Can't they realize that! I'm married to Hugh Barton! I'm HIS wife! Are you?",1
2810,"thought Eugene. Are you? But Eliza sat before the fire at Dixieland with hands folded, reliving a past of tenderness and love that never had been. And as the wind howled in the bleak street, and Eliza wove a thousand fables of that lost and bitter spirit, the bright and stricken thing in the boy twisted about in horror, looking for escape from the house of death. No more! No more! (it said). You are alone now. You are lost. Go find yourself, lost boy, beyond the hills.",1
2811,"This little bright and stricken thing stood up on Eugene's heart and talked into his mouth. O but I can't go now, said Eugene to it. (Why not? it whispered.) Because her face is so white, and her forehead is so broad and high, with the black hair drawn back from it, and when she sat there at the bed she looked like a little child. I can't go now and leave her here alone. (She is alone, it said, and so are you.) And when she purses up her mouth and stares, so grave and thoughtful, she is like a little child. (You are alone now, it said. You must escape, or you will die.) It is all like death: she fed me at her breast, I slept in the same bed with her, she took me on her trips. All of that is over now, and each time it was like a death. (And like a life, it said to him. Each time that you die, you will be born again. And you will die a hundred times before you become a man.) I can't! I can't! Not now-- later, more slowly. (No. Now, it said.) I am afraid. I have nowhere to go. (You must find the place, it said.) I am lost. (You must hunt for yourself, it said.) I am alone. Where are you? (You must find me, it said.)",1
2812,"Then, as the bright thing twisted about in him, Eugene heard the whine of the bleak wind about the house that he must leave, and the voice of Eliza calling up from the past the beautiful lost things that never happened. --and I said, 'Why, what on earth, boy, you want to dress up warm around your neck or you'll catch your death of cold.'""  Eugene caught at his throat and plunged for the door. Here, boy! Where are you going?"" said Eliza, looking up quickly.",1
2813,"I've got to go,"" he said in a choking voice. I've got to get away from here. Then he saw the fear in her eyes, and the grave troubled child's stare.",1
2814,"He rushed to where she sat and grasped her hand. She held him tightly and laid her face against his arm. Don't go yet,"" she said. You've all your life ahead of you. Stay with me just a day or two. Yes, mama,"" he said, falling to his knees.",1
2815,"Yes, mama. He hugged her to him frantically. Yes, mama. God bless you, mama. It's all right, mama. It's all right. Eliza wept bitterly.",1
2816,"I'm an old woman,"" she said, ""and one by one I've lost you all. He's dead now, and I never got to know him. O son, don't leave me yet. You're the only one that's left: you were my baby. Don't go! Don't go. She laid her white face against his sleeve.",1
2817,"It is not hard to go (he thought). But when can we forget? It was October and the leaves were quaking. Dusk was beginning. The sun had gone, the western ranges faded in chill purple mist, but the western sky still burned with ragged bands of orange. It was October.",1
2818,"Eugene walked swiftly along the sinuous paved curves of Rutledge Road. There was a smell of fog and supper in the air: a warm moist blur at window-panes, and the pungent sizzle of cookery. There were mist-far voices, and a smell of burning leaves, and a warm yellow blur of lights.",1
2819,"He turned into an unpaved road by the big wooden sanitarium. He heard the rich kitchen laughter of the negroes, the larded sizzle of food, the dry veranda coughing of the lungers. He walked briskly along the lumpy road, with a dry scuffling of leaves. The air was a chill dusky pearl: above him a few pale stars were out. The town and the house were behind him. There was a singing in the great hill-pines.",1
2820,"Two women came down the road and passed him. He saw that they were country women. They were dressed rustily in black, and one of them was weeping. He thought of the men who had been laid in the earth that day, and of all the women who wept. Will they come again? he wondered.",1
2821,"When he came to the gate of the cemetery he found it open. He went in quickly and walked swiftly up the winding road that curved around the crest of the hill. The grasses were dry and sere; a wilted wreath of laurel lay upon a grave. As he approached the family plot, his pulse quickened a little. Some one was moving slowly, deliberately, in among the grave-stones. But as he came up he saw that it was Mrs. Pert.",1
2822,"Good-evening, Mrs. Pert,"" said Eugene. Who is it? she asked, peering murkily. She came to him with her grave unsteady step.",1
2823,"It's 'Gene,"" he said. Oh, is it Old 'Gene?"" she said. How are you, 'Gene?""  ""Pretty well,"" he said.",1
2824,"He stood awkwardly, chilled, not knowing how to continue. It was getting dark. There were long lonely preludes to winter in the splendid pines, and a whistling of wind in the long grasses. Below them, in the gulch, night had come. There was a negro settlement there--Stumptown, it was called. The rich voices of Africa wailed up to them their jungle dirge.",1
2825,"But in the distance, away on their level and above, on other hills, they saw the town. Slowly, in twinkling nests, the lights of the town went up, and there were frost-far voices, and music, and the laughter of a girl. This is a nice place,"" said Eugene. You get a nice view of the town from here. Yes,"" said Mrs. Pert.",1
2826,"And Old Ben's got the nicest place of all. You get a better view right here than anywhere else. I've been here before in the daytime. In a moment she went on. Old Ben will turn into lovely flowers. Roses, I think. No,"" said Eugene, ""dandelions--and big flowers with a lot of thorns on them.",1
2827,"She stood looking about fuzzily for a moment, with the blurred gentle smile on her lips. It is getting dark, Mrs. Pert,"" said Eugene hesitantly. Are you out here alone? Alone?",1
2828,"I've got Old 'Gene and Old Ben here, haven't I? she said. Maybe we'd better go back, Mrs. Pert?"" he said. It's going to turn cold to-night. I'll go with you. Fatty can go by herself,"" she said with dignity.",1
2829,"Don't worry, 'Gene. I'll leave you alone. That's all right,"" said Eugene, confused.",1
2830,"We both came for the same reason, I suppose. Yes,"" said Mrs. Pert. Who'll be coming here this time next year, I wonder? Will Old 'Gene come back then?""  ""No,"" said Eugene.",1
2831,"No, Mrs. Pert. I shall never come here again. Nor I, 'Gene,"" she said.",1
2832,"When do you go back to school? To-morrow,"" he said. Then Fatty will have to say good-bye,"" she said reproachfully. I'm going away too. Where are you going?"" he asked, surprised.",1
2833,"I'm going to live with my daughter in Tennessee. You didn't know Fatty was a grandmother, did you? she said, with her soft blurred smile. I've a little grandson two years old. I'm sorry to see you go,"" Eugene said.",1
2834,"Mrs. Pert was silent a moment, rocking vaguely upon her feet. What did they say was wrong with Ben?"" she asked. He had pneumonia, Mrs. Pert,"" said Eugene.",1
2835,"Oh, pneumonia! That's it! She nodded her head wisely as if satisfied. My husband's a drug salesman, you know, but I never can remember all the things that people have.  Pneumonia. She was silent again, reflecting.",1
2836,"And when they shut you up in a box and put you in the ground, the way they did Old Ben, what do they call that? she asked with a soft inquiring smile. He did not laugh.",1
2837,"They call that death, Mrs. Pert. Death! Yes, that's it,"" said Mrs. Pert brightly, nodding her head in agreement. That's one kind, 'Gene. There are some other lands, too. Did you know that? She smiled at him.",1
2838,"Yes,"" said Eugene. I know that, Mrs. Pert. She stretched out her hands suddenly to him, and clasped his cold fingers.",1
2839,"She did not smile any more. Good-bye, my dear,"" she said. We both knew Ben, didn't we? God bless you. Then she turned and walked away down the road, at her portly uncertain gait, and was lost in the gathering dark.",1
2840,"The great stars rode proudly up into heaven. And just over him, just over the town, it seemed, there was one so rich and low he could have touched it. Ben's grave had been that day freshly sodded: there was a sharp cold smell of earth there. Eugene thought of Spring, and the poignant and wordless odor of the elvish dandelions that would be there. In the frosty dark, far-faint, there was the departing wail of a whistle.",1
2841,"And suddenly, as he watched the lights wink cheerfully up in the town, their warm message of the hived life of men brought to him a numb hunger for all the words and the faces. He heard the far voices and laughter. And on the distant road a powerful car, bending around the curve, cast over him for a second, over that lonely hill of the dead, its great shaft of light and life. In his numbed mind, which for days now had fumbled curiously with little things, with little things alone, as a child fumbles with blocks or with little things, a light was growing.",1
2842,"His mind gathered itself out of the wreckage of little things: out of all that the world had shown or taught him he could remember now only the great star above the town, and the light that had swung over the hill, and the fresh sod upon Ben's grave, and the wind, and far sounds and music, and Mrs. Pert. Wind pressed the boughs, the withered leaves were shaking. It was October, but the leaves were shaking. A star was shaking. A light was waking. Wind was quaking. The star was far. The night, the light. The light was bright. A chant, a song, the slow dance of the little things within him. The star over the town, the light over the hill, the sod over Ben, night over all. His mind fumbled with little things. Over us all is something. Star, night, earth, light . . . light . . . O lost! . . . a stone . . . a leaf . . . a door . . . O ghost! . . . a light . . . a song . . . a light . . . a light swings over the hill . . . over us all . . . a star shines over the town . . . over us all . . . a light.",1
2843,"We shall not come again. We never shall come back again. But over us all, over us all, over us all is--something.",1
2844,"Wind pressed the boughs; the withered leaves were shaking. It was October, but some leaves were shaking. A light swings over the hill. (We shall not come again.) And over the town a star. (Over us all, over us all that shall not come again.) And over the day the dark. But over the darkness--what?  We shall not come again.",1
2845,"We never shall come back again. Over the dawn a lark. (That shall not come again.) And wind and music far. O lost! (It shall not come again.) And over your mouth the earth. O ghost! But, over the darkness--what?  Wind pressed the boughs; the withered leaves were quaking.",1
2846,"We shall not come again. We never shall come back again. It was October, but we never shall come back again.",1
2847,"When will they come again? When will they come again? The laurel, the lizard, and the stone will come no more. The women weeping at the gate have gone and will not come again. And pain and pride and death will pass, and will not come again. And light and dawn will pass, and the star and the cry of a lark will pass, and will not come again. And we shall pass, and shall not come again.",1
2848,"What things will come again? O Spring, the cruellest and fairest of the seasons, will come again. And the strange and buried men will come again, in flower and leaf the strange and buried men will come again, and death and the dust will never come again, for death and the dust will die. And Ben will come again, he will not die again, in flower and leaf, in wind and music far, he will come back again.",1
2849,"O lost, and by the wind grieved, ghost, come back again! It had grown dark. The frosty night blazed with great brilliant stars. The lights in the town shone with sharp radiance. Presently, when he had lain upon the cold earth for some time, Eugene got up and went away toward the town.",1
2850,"Wind pressed the boughs; the withered leaves were shaking. 38   Three weeks after Eugene's return to the university the war ended. The students cursed and took off their uniforms. But they rang the great bronze bell, and built a bonfire on the campus, leaping around it like dervishes.",1
2851,"Life fell back into civilian patterns. The gray back of winter was broken: the Spring came through. Eugene was a great man on the campus of the little university. He plunged exultantly into the life of the place. He cried out in his throat with his joy: all over the country, life was returning, reviving, awaking. The young men were coming back to the campus. The leaves were out in a tender green blur: the quilled jonquil spouted from the rich black earth, and peach-bloom fell upon the shrill young isles of grass. Everywhere life was returning, awaking, reviving. With victorious joy, Eugene thought of the flowers above Ben's grave.",1
2852,"He was wild with ecstasy because the Spring had beaten death. The grief of Ben sank to a forgotten depth in him. He was charged with the juice of life and motion. He did not walk: he bounded along. He joined everything he had not joined. He made funny speeches in chapel, at smokers, at meetings of all sorts. He edited the paper, he wrote poems and stories--he flung outward without pause or thought.",1
2853,"Sometimes at night he would rush across the country, beside a drunken driver, to Exeter and Sydney, and there seek out the women behind the chained lattices, calling to them in the fresh dawn-dusk of Spring his young goat-cry of desire and hunger. Lily! Louise! Ruth! Ellen! O mother of love, you cradle of birth and living, whatever your billion names may be, I come, your son, your lover. Stand, Maya, by your opened door, denned in the jungle web of Niggertown.",1
2854,"Sometimes, when he walked softly by, he heard the young men talking in their rooms of Eugene Gant. Eugene Gant was crazy. Eugene Gant was mad. Oh, I (he thought) am Eugene Gant!",1
2855,"Then a voice said:  ""He didn't change his underwear for six weeks. One of his fraternity brothers told me so. And another:  ""He takes a bath once a month, whether he needs it or not. They laughed; one said then that he was ""brilliant""; they all agreed.",1
2856,"He caught the claw of his hand into his lean throat. They are talking of me, of me! I am Eugene Gant--the conqueror of nations, lord of the earth, the Siva of a thousand beautiful forms.",1
2857,"In nakedness and loneliness of soul he paced along the streets. Nobody said, I know you. Nobody said, I am here.",1
2858,"The vast wheel of life, of which he was the hub, spun round. Most of us think we're hell, thought Eugene. I do. I think I'm hell. Then, in the dark campus path, he heard the young men talking in their rooms, and he gouged at his face bloodily, with a snarl of hate against himself.",1
2859,"I think I am hell, and they say I stink because I have not had a bath. But I could not stink, even if I never had a bath. Only the others stink. My dirtiness is better than their cleanliness. The web of my flesh is finer; my blood is a subtle elixir; the hair of my head, the marrow of my spine, the cunning jointure of my bones, and all the combining jellies, fats, meats, oils, and sinews of my flesh, the spittle of my mouth, the sweat of my skin, is mixed with rarer elements, and is fairer and finer than their gross peasant beef.",1
2860,"There had appeared that year upon the nape of his neck a small tetter of itch, a sign of his kinship with the Pentlands--a token of his kinship with the great malady of life. He tore at the spot with frantic nails; he burned his neck to a peeled blister with carbolic acid--but the spot, as if fed by some ineradicable leprosy in his blood, remained. Sometimes, during cool weather, it almost disappeared; but in warm weather it returned angrily, and he scraped his neck red in an itching torture.",1
2861,"He was afraid to let people walk behind him. He sat, whenever possible, with his back to the wall; he was in agony when he descended a crowded stair, holding his shoulders high so that the collar of his coat might hide the terrible patch. He let his hair grow in a great thick mat, partly to hide his sore, and partly because exposing it to the view of the barber touched him with shame and horror.",1
2862,"He would become at times insanely conscious of spotless youth: he was terrified before the loud good health of America, which is really a sickness, because no man will admit his sores. He shrank back at the memory of his lost heroic fantasies: he thought of Bruce-Eugene, of all his thousand romantic impersonations, and never could he endure himself with an itching tetter upon his flesh. He became morbidly conscious of all his blemishes, real and fancied: for days he would see nothing but people's teeth--he would stare into their mouths when he talked to them, noting the fillings, the extractions, the plates and bridges. He would gaze with envy and fear at the sound ivory grinders of the young men, baring his own, which were regular but somewhat yellowed with smoking, a hundred times a day. He scrubbed at them savagely with a stiff brush until the gums bled; he brooded for hours upon a decaying molar which must one day be extracted, and, wild with despair, he would figure out on paper the age at which he might become toothless.",1
2863,"But if, he thought, I lose only one every two years after I am twenty, I shall still have over fifteen left when I am fifty, since we have thirty-two, including wisdom-teeth. And it will not look so bad, if only I can save the front ones. Then, with his hope in futures, he thought: But by that time perhaps the dentists can give me real ones. He read several dental magazines to see if there was any hope for the transplanting of sound teeth for old ones. Then, with brooding satisfaction, he studied his sensual deeply scalloped mouth with the pouting underlip, noting that even when he smiled he barely revealed his teeth.",1
2864,"He asked the medical students innumerable questions about the treatment or cure of inherited blood maladies, venereal diseases, intestinal and inguinal cancers, and the transference of animal glands to men. He went to the movies only to examine the teeth and muscles of the hero; he pored over the toothpaste and collar advertisements in the magazines; he went to the shower-rooms at the gymnasium and stared at the straight toes of the young men, thinking with desperate sick pain of his own bunched and crooked ones. He stood naked before a mirror, looking at his long gaunt body, smooth and white save for the crooked toes and the terrible spot on his neck--lean, but moulded with delicate and powerful symmetry.",1
2865,"Then, slowly, he began to take a terrible joy in his taint. The thing on his neck that could not be gouged or burnt away he identified with a tragic humor of his blood that plunged him downward at times into melancholia and madness. But there was, he saw, a great health in him as well, that could bring him back victoriously from desolation. In his reading of fiction, in the movies, in the collar advertisements, in all his thousand fantasies of Bruce-Eugene, he had never known a hero with crooked toes, a decaying tooth, and a patch of tetter on his neck. Nor had he ever known a heroine, whether among the society women of Chambers and Phillips, or among the great elegants of Meredith and Ouida, who had borne such a blemish. But, in all his fantasies now, he loved a woman with hair of carrot silk and eyes of a faintly weary violet, webbed delicately at the corners. Her teeth were small, white and irregular, and she had one molar edged with gold which was visible when she smiled. She was subtle, and a little weary: a child and a mother, as old and as deep as Asia, and as young as germinal April who returns forever like a girl, a mistress, a parent, and a nurse.",1
2866,"Thus, through the death of his brother, and the sickness that was rooted in his own flesh, Eugene came to know a deeper and darker wisdom than he had ever known before. He began to see that what was subtle and beautiful in human life was touched with a divine pearl-sickness. Health was to be found in the steady stare of the cats and dogs, or in the smooth vacant chops of the peasant. But he looked on the faces of the lords of the earth--and he saw them wasted and devoured by the beautiful disease of thought and passion. In the pages of a thousand books he saw their portraits: Coleridge at twenty-five, with the loose sensual mouth, gaping idiotically, the vast staring eyes, holding in their opium depths the vision of seas haunted by the albatross, the great white forehead--head mixed of Zeus and the village degenerate; the lean worn head of Caesar, a little thirsty in the flanks; and the dreaming mummy face of Kublai Khan, lit with eyes that flickered with green fires. And he saw the faces of the great Thothmes, and Aspalta and Mycerinus, and all the heads of subtle Egypt--those smooth unwrinkled faces that held the wisdom of 1,200 gods. And the strange wild faces of the Goth, the Frank, the Vandal, that came storming up below the old tired eyes of Rome. And the weary craftiness on the face of the great Jew, Disraeli; the terrible skull-grin of Voltaire; the mad ranting savagery of Ben Jonson's; the dour wild agony of Carlyle's; and the faces of Heine, and Rousseau, and Dante, and Tiglath-Pileser, and Cervantes--these were all faces on which life had fed. They were faces wasted by the vulture, Thought; they were faces seared and hollowed by the flame of Beauty.",1
2867,"And thus, touched with the terrible destiny of his blood, caught in the trap of himself and the Pentlands, with the little flower of sin and darkness on his neck, Eugene escaped forever from the good and the pretty, into a dark land that is forbidden to the sterilized. The creatures of romantic fiction, the vicious doll- faces of the movie women, the brutal idiot regularity of the faces in the advertisements, and the faces of most of the young college- men and women, were stamped in a mould of enamelled vacancy, and became unclean to him. The national demand for white shiny plumbing, toothpaste, tiled lunch-rooms, hair-cuts, manicured dentistry, horn spectacles, baths, and the insane fear of disease that sent the voters whispering to the druggist after their brutal fumbling lecheries-- all of this seemed nasty. Their outer cleanliness became the token of an inner corruption: it was something that glittered and was dry, foul, and rotten at the core. He felt that, no matter what leper's taint he might carry upon his flesh, there was in him a health that was greater than they could ever know--something fierce and cruelly wounded, but alive, that did not shrink away from the terrible sunken river of life; something desperate and merciless that looked steadily on the hidden and unspeakable passions that unify the tragic family of this earth.",1
2868,"Yet, Eugene was no rebel. He had no greater need for rebellion than have most Americans, which is none at all. He was quite content with any system which might give him comfort, security, enough money to do as he liked, and freedom to think, eat, drink, love, read, and write what he chose. And he did not care under what form of government he lived--Republican, Democrat, Tory, Socialist, or Bolshevist--if it could assure him these things. He did not want to reform the world, or to make it a better place to live in: his whole conviction was that the world was full of pleasant places, enchanted places, if he could only go and find them. The life around him was beginning to fetter and annoy him: he wanted to escape from it. He felt sure things would be better elsewhere. He always felt sure things would be better elsewhere.",1
2869,"It was not his quality as a romantic to escape out of life, but into it. He wanted no land of Make-believe: his fantasies found extension in reality, and he saw no reason to doubt that there really were 1,200 gods in Egypt, and that the centaur, the hippogriff, and the winged bull might all be found in their proper places. He believed that there was magic in Byzantium, and genii stoppered up in wizards' bottles. Moreover, since Ben's death, the conviction had grown on him that men do not escape from life because life is dull, but that life escapes from men because men are little. He felt that the passions of the play were greater than the actors. It seemed to him that he had never had a great moment of living in which he had measured up to its fulness. His pain at Ben's death had been greater than he, the love and loss of Laura had left him stricken and bewildered, and when he embraced young girls and women he felt a desperate frustration: he wanted to eat them like cake and to have them, too; to roll them up into a ball; to entomb them in his flesh; to possess them more fully than they may ever be possessed.",1
2870,"Further, it annoyed and wounded him to be considered ""queer. He exulted in his popularity among the students, his heart pounded with pride under all the pins and emblems, but he resented being considered an eccentric, and he envied those of his fellows who were elected to office for their solid golden mediocrity. He wanted to obey the laws and to be respected: he believed himself to be a sincerely conventional person--but, some one would see him after midnight, bounding along a campus path, with goat-cries beneath the moon. His suits went baggy, his shirts and drawers got dirty, his shoes wore through--he stuffed them with cardboard strips--his hats grew shapeless and wore through at the creases. But he did not mean to go unkempt--the thought of going for repairs filled him with weary horror. He hated to act--he wanted to brood upon his entrails for fourteen hours a day. At length, goaded, he would lash his great bulk, lulled in the powerful inertia of its visions, into a cursing and violent movement.",1
2871,"He was desperately afraid of people in crowds: at class meetings, or smokers, or at any public gathering, he was nervous and constrained until he began to talk to them, and got them under him. He was always afraid that some one would make a joke about him, and that he would be laughed at. But he was not afraid of any man alone: he felt that he could handle any one if he got him away from his crowd. Remembering his savage fear and hatred of the crowd, with a man alone he could play cruelly, like a cat, snarling gently at him, prowling in on him softly, keeping cocked and silent the terrible tiger's paw of his spirit. All of their starch oozed out of them; they seemed to squeak and twitter, and look round for the door. He would get some loud pompous yokel--the student president of the Y. M. C. A., or the class president--and bear down on him with evil gentle matter-of-factness.",1
2872,"Don't you think,"" he would begin with earnest piety, ""don't you think that a man should kiss his wife on her belly? And he would fasten all the eager innocence of his face into a stare. For, after all, the belly is sometimes more beautiful than the mouth, and far cleaner. Or do you believe in the belly-less marriage? I, for one,"" he went on with proud passion, ""do not! I stand for more and better Belly-Kissing. Our wives, our mothers, and our sisters expect it of us. It is an act of reverence to the seat of life. Nay! it is even an act of religious worship. If we could get our prominent business men and all the other right- thinking people interested in it, it would bring about the mightiest revolution ever known in a nation's life. In five years it would do away with divorce and re-establish the prestige of the home. In twenty years it would make our nation the proud centre of civilization and the arts. Don't you think so? Or do you?""  Eugene thought so.",1
2873,"It was one of his few Utopias. Sometimes, when he was in a chafed and bitter temper, he would hear a burst of laughter from a student's room, and he would turn snarling, and curse them, believing they laughed at him. He inherited his father's conviction at times that the world was gathered in an immense conspiracy against him: the air about him was full of mockery and menace, the leaves whispered with treason, in a thousand secret places people were assembled to humiliate, degrade, and betray him. He would spend hours under the terrible imminence of some unknown danger: although he was guilty of nothing but his own nightmare fantasies, he would enter a class, a meeting, a gathering of students, with cold constricted heart, awaiting exposure, sentence, and ruin, for he knew not what crime. Again, he would be wild, extravagant, and careless, squealing triumphantly in their faces and bounding along possessed with goaty joy, as he saw life dangling like a plum for his taking.",1
2874,"And thus, going along a campus path at night, fulfilled with his dreams of glory, he heard young men talking of him kindly and coarsely, laughing at his antics, and saying he needed a bath and clean underwear. He clawed at his throat as he listened. I think I'm hell, thought Eugene, and they say I stink because I have not had a bath. Me! Me!  Bruce-Eugene, the Scourge of the Greasers, and the greatest fullback Yale ever had! Marshal Gant, the saviour of his country! Ace Gant, the hawk of the sky, the man who brought Richthofen down! Senator Gant, Governor Gant, President Gant, the restorer and uniter of a broken nation, retiring quietly to private life in spite of the weeping protest of one hundred million people, until, like Arthur or Barbarossa, he shall hear again the drums of need and peril.",1
2875,"Jesus-of-Nazareth Gant, mocked, reviled, spat upon, and imprisoned for the sins of others, but nobly silent, preferring death rather than cause pain to the woman he loves. Gant, the Unknown Soldier, the Martyred President, the slain God of Harvest, the Bringer of Good Crops. Duke Gant of Westmoreland, Viscount Pondicherry, twelfth Lord Runnymede, who hunts for true love, incognito, in Devon and ripe grain, and finds the calico white legs embedded in sweet hay. Yes, George-Gordon-Noel-Byron Gant, carrying the pageant of his bleeding heart through Europe, and Thomas-Chatterton Gant (that bright boy!), and François-Villon Gant, and Ahasuerus Gant, and Mithridates Gant, and Artaxerxes Gant, and Edward-the- Black-Prince Gant; Stilicho Gant, and Jugurtha Gant, and Vercingetorix Gant, and Czar-Ivan-the-Terrible Gant. And Gant, the Olympian Bull; and Heracles Gant; and Gant, the Seductive Swan; and Ashtaroth and Azrael Gant, Proteus Gant, Anubis and Osiris and Mumbo-Jumbo Gant.",1
2876,"But what, said Eugene very slowly into the darkness, if I'm not a Genius? He did not ask himself the question often. He was alone: he spoke aloud, but in a low voice, in order to feel the unreality of this blasphemy. It was a moonless night, full of stars. There was no thunder and no lightning.",1
2877,"Yes, but what, he thought with a livid snarl, but what if anybody else thinks I'm not? Ah, but they'd like to, the swine. They hate me, and are jealous of me because they can't be like me, so they belittle me if they can. They'd like to say it, if they dared, just to hurt me. For a moment his face was convulsed with pain and bitterness: he craned his neck, holding his throat with his hand.",1
2878,"Then, as was his custom, when he had burnt his heart out, he began to look nakedly and critically at the question. Well, he went on very calmly, what if I'm not? Am I going to cut my throat, or eat worms, or swallow arsenic? He shook his head slowly but emphatically. No, he said, I am not. Besides, there are enough geniuses. They have at least one in every high school, and one in the orchestra of every small-town movie. Sometimes Mrs. Von Zeck, the wealthy patroness of the arts, sends a genius or two off to New York to study. So that, he estimated, this broad land of ours has by the census not less than 26,400 geniuses and 83,752 artists, not counting those in business and advertising. For his personal satisfaction, Eugene then muttered over the names of 21 geniuses who wrote poetry, and 37 more who devoted themselves to the drama and the novel. After this, he felt quite relieved.",1
2879,"What, he thought, can I be, besides a genius? I've been one long enough. There must be better things to do.",1
2880,"Over that final hedge, he thought, not death, as I once believed-- but new life--and new lands. Erect, with arm akimbo on his hip, he stood, his domed head turned out toward the light: sixty, subtle and straight of body, deep- browed, with an old glint of hawk-eyes, lean apple-cheeks, a mustache bristle-cropped. That face on which the condor Thought has fed, arched with high subtle malice, sophist glee.",1
2881,"Below, benched in rapt servility, they waited for his first husky word. Eugene looked at the dull earnest faces, lured from the solid pews of Calvinism to the shadowland of metaphysics. And now his mockery will play like lightning around their heads, but they will never see it, nor feel it strike. They will rush forward to wrestle with his shadow, to hear his demon's laughter, to struggle solemnly with their unborn souls.",1
2882,"The clean cuffed hand holds up an abraded stick. Their stare follows obediently along its lustre. Mr. Willis?""  White, bewildered, servile, the patient slave's face.",1
2883,"Yes, sir.""  ""What have I here? A stick, sir.""  ""What is a stick?""  ""It's a piece of wood, sir. A pause.",1
2884,Ironic eyebrows ask their laughter. They snicker smugly for the wolf that will devour them. Mr. Willis says a stick is a piece of wood. Their laughter rattles against the walls.,1
2885,"Absurd. But a stick IS a piece of wood,"" says Mr. Willis. So is a tree or a telephone-pole. No, I'm afraid that will not do. Does the class agree with Mr. Willis?""  ""A stick is a piece of wood cut off at a certain length.",1
2886,"Then we agree, Mr. Ransom, that a stick is not simply wood with unlimited extension?""  The stunned peasant's face with its blink of effort. I see that Mr. Gant is leaning forward in his seat. There is a light in his face that I have seen there before. Mr. Gant will not sleep of nights, for thinking. A stick,"" said Eugene, ""is not only wood but the negation of wood.",1
2887,"It is the meeting in Space of Wood and No-Wood. A stick is finite and unextended wood, a fact determined by its own denial. The old head listens gravely above the ironic intake of their breath.",1
2888,"He will bear me out and praise me, for I am measured against this peasant earth. He sees me with the titles of proud office; and he loves victory. We have a new name for him, Professor Weldon,"" said Nick Mabley. We call him Hegel Gant. He listened to their shout of laughter; he saw their pleased faces turn back on him.",1
2889,"That was meant well. I shall smile--their Great Original, the beloved eccentric, the poet of substantial yokels. That's a name he may be worthy of,"" said Vergil Weldon seriously.",1
2890,"Old Fox, I too can juggle with your phrases so they will never catch me. Over the jungle of their wits our unfoiled minds strike irony and passion. Truth? Reality? The Absolute? The Universal? Wisdom? Experience? Knowledge? The Fact? The Concept? Death-- the great negation? Parry and thrust, Volpone! Have we not words? We shall prove anything. But Ben, and the demon-flicker of his smile? Where now?  The Spring comes back.",1
2891,"I see the sheep upon the hill. The belled cows come along the road in wreaths of dust, and the wagons creak home below the pale ghost of the moon. But what stirs within the buried heart? Where are the lost words? And who has seen his shadow in the Square?",1
2892,"And if they asked you, Mr. Rountree?""  ""I'd have told the truth,"" said Mr. Rountree, removing his glasses. But they had built a good big fire, Mr. Rountree. That doesn't matter,"" said Mr. Rountree, putting his glasses on again.",1
2893,"How nobly we can die for truth--in conversation. It was a very hot fire, Mr. Rountree. They'd have burned you if you hadn't recanted. Ah.  I'd have let them burn,"" said the martyred Rountree through moistening spectacles.",1
2894,"I think it might be painful,"" Vergil Weldon suggested. Even a little blister hurts. Who wants to be burned for anything?"" said Eugene.",1
2895,"I'd have done what Galileo did--backed out of it. So should I,"" said Vergil Weldon, and their faces arched with gleeful malice over the heavy laughter of the class. Nevertheless, it moves.",1
2896,"On one side of the table stood the combined powers of Europe; on the other stood Martin Luther, the son of a blacksmith. The voice of husky passion, soul-shaken. This they can remember, and put down.",1
2897,"There, if ever, was a situation to try the strongest soul. But the answer came like a flash. Ich kann nicht anders--I can't do otherwise. It was one of the great utterances of history. That phrase, used now for thirty years, relic of Yale and Harvard: Royce and Munsterberg.",1
2898,"In all this jugglery, the Teutons were Weldon's masters, yet mark how thirstily the class lap it up. He will not let them read, lest some one find the rag-quilt of his takings from Zeno to Immanuel Kant. The crazy patchwork of three thousand years, the forced marriage of irreconcilables, the summation of all thought, in his old head. Socrates begat Plato. Plato begat Plotinus. Plotinus begat St. Augustine. . . . Kant begat Hegel. Hegel begat Vergil Weldon. Here we pause. There's no more to beget. An Answer to All Things in Thirty Easy Lessons. How sure they are they've found it!",1
2899,"And to-night they will carry their dull souls into his study, will make unfleshly confessions, will writhe in concocted tortures of the spirit, revealing struggles that they never had. It took character to do a thing like that. It took a man who refused to crack under pressure. And that is what I want my boys to do! I want them to succeed! I want them to absorb their negations. I want them to keep as clean as a hound's tooth!""  Eugene winced, and looked around on all the faces set in a resolve to fight desperately for monogamy, party politics, and the will of the greatest number.",1
2900,"And yet the Baptists fear this man! Why? He has taken the whiskers off their God, but for the rest, he has only taught them to vote the ticket.",1
2901,"So here is Hegel in the Cotton Belt!  During these years Eugene would go away from Pulpit Hill, by night and by day, when April was a young green blur, or when the Spring was deep and ripe. But he liked best to go away by night, rushing across a cool Spring countryside full of dew and starlight, under a great beach of the moon ribbed with clouds. He would go to Exeter or Sydney; sometimes he would go to little towns he had never before visited. He would register at hotels as ""Robert Herrick,"" ""John Donne,"" ""George Peele,"" ""William Blake,"" and ""John Milton. No one ever said anything to him about it. The people in those small towns had such names. Once he registered at a hotel, in a small Piedmont town, as ""Ben Jonson. The clerk spun the book critically.",1
2902,"Isn't there an h in that name?"" he said. No,"" said Eugene. That's another branch of the family. I have an uncle, Samuel, who spells his name that way. Sometimes, at hotels of ill-repute, he would register, with dark buried glee, as ""Robert Browning,"" ""Alfred Tennyson,"" and ""William Wordsworth.",1
2903,"Once he registered as ""Henry W. Longfellow. You can't fool me,"" said the clerk, with a hard grin of disbelief. That's the name of a writer. He was devoured by a vast strange hunger for life.",1
2904,"At night, he listened to the million-noted ululation of little night things, the great brooding symphony of dark, the ringing of remote churchbells across the country. And his vision widened out in circles over moon-drenched meadows, dreaming woods, mighty rivers going along in darkness, and ten thousand sleeping towns. He believed in the infinite rich variety of all the towns and faces: behind any of a million shabby houses he believed there was strange buried life, subtle and shattered romance, something dark and unknown. At the moment of passing any house, he thought, some one therein might be at the gate of death, lovers might lie twisted in hot embrace, murder might be doing.",1
2905,"He felt a desperate frustration, as if he were being shut out from the rich banquet of life. And against all caution, he determined to break the pattern of custom, and look within. Driven on by this hunger, he would suddenly rush away from Pulpit Hill and, as dusk came on, prowl up and down the quiet streets of towns. Finally, lifted beyond all restraint, he would mount swiftly to a door and ring the bell. Then, to whoever came, reeling against the wall and clutching at his throat, he would say:  ""Water!",1
2906,"In God's name, water! I am ill! Sometimes there were women, seductive and smiling, aware of his trick, but loath to let him go; sometimes women touched with compassion and tenderness. Then, having drunk, he would smile with brave apology into startled and sympathetic faces, murmuring:  ""Pardon me.",1
2907,It came on suddenly--one of my attacks. I had no time to go for help. I saw your light. Then they would ask him where his friends were.,1
2908,"Friends! he glanced about wildly and darkly. Then, with a bitter laugh, he said, ""Friends! I have none! I am a stranger here. Then they would ask him what he did.",1
2909,"I am a Carpenter,"" he would answer, smiling strangely. Then they would ask him where he came from. Far away. Very far,"" he would say deeply. You would not know if I told you. Then he would rise, looking about him with grandeur and compassion.",1
2910,"And now I must go! he would say mysteriously. I have a long way to go before my journey is done. God bless you all! I was a stranger and you gave me shelter. The Son of Man was treated not so well. Sometimes, he would ring bells with an air of timid inquiry, saying:  ""Is this number 26?",1
2911,"My name is Thomas Chatterton. I am looking for a gentleman by the name of Coleridge--Mr. Samuel T. Coleridge. Does he live here? . . . No?  I'm sorry. . . . Yes, 26 is the number I have, I'm sure. . . . Thank you . . . I've made a mistake . . . I'll look it up in the telephone directory.",1
2912,"But what, thought Eugene, if one day, in the million streets of life, I should really find him? These were the golden years.    39   Gant and Eliza came to his graduation. He found them lodgings in the town: it was early June--hot, green, fiercely and voluptuously Southern. The campus was a green oven; the old grads went about in greasy pairs; the cool pretty girls, who never sweated, came in to see their young men graduate, and to dance; the mamas and papas were shown about dumbly and shyly.",1
2913,"The college was charming, half-deserted. Most of the students, except the graduating class, had departed. The air was charged with the fresh sensual heat, the deep green shimmer of heavy leafage, a thousand spermy earth and flower-scents. The young men were touched with sadness, with groping excitement, with glory.",1
2914,"On this rich stage, Gant, who had left his charnel-house of death for three days, saw his son Eugene. He came, gathered to life again, out of his grave. He saw his son enthroned in all the florid sentiment of commencement, and the whole of his heart was lifted out of the dust. Upon the lordly sward, shaded by great trees, and ringed by his solemn classmen and their families, Eugene read the Class Poem (""O Mother Of Our Myriad Hopes""). Then Vergil Weldon spoke, high-husky, deep, and solemn-sad; and Living Truth welled in their hearts. It was a Great Utterance. Be true! Be clean! Be good! Be men! Absorb the Negation! The world has need of. Life was never so worth. Never in history had there been. No other class had shown so great a promise as. Among other achievements, the editor of the paper had lifted the moral and intellectual level of the State two inches. The university spirit! Character! Service! Leadership!",1
2915,Eugene's face grew dark with pride and joy there in the lovely wilderness. He could not speak. There was a glory in the world: life was panting for his embrace.,1
2916,"Eliza and Gant listened attentively to all the songs and speeches. Their son was a great man on the campus. They saw and heard him before his class, on the campus, and at graduation, when his prizes and honors were announced. And his teachers and companions spoke to them about him, and said he would have ""a brilliant career. And Eliza and Gant were touched a little by the false golden glow of youth. They believed for a moment that all things were possible.",1
2917,"Well, son,"" said Gant, ""the rest is up to you now. I believe you're going to make a name for yourself. He laid a great dry hand clumsily upon his son's shoulder, and for a moment Eugene saw in the dead eyes the old dark of umber and unfound desire.",1
2918,"Hm!"" Eliza began, with a tremulous bantering smile, ""your head will get turned by all the things they're saying about you. She took his hand in her rough warm grasp. Her eyes grew suddenly wet.",1
2919,"Well, son,"" she said gravely. I want you to go ahead now and try to be Somebody. None of the others ever had your opportunity, and I hope you do something with it. Your papa and I have done the best we could. The rest is up to you. He took her hand in a moment of wild devotion and kissed it.",1
2920,"I'll do something,"" he said. I will. They looked shyly at his strange dark face, with all its passionate and naïve ardor, and they felt tenderness and love for his youth and all that was unknown to it.",1
2921,"And a great love and pity welled up in him because of their strange and awkward loneliness, and because he felt, through some terrible intuition, that he was already indifferent to the titles and honors they desired for him, and because those which he had come to desire for himself were already beyond the scale of their value. And, before the vision of pity and loss and loneliness, he turned away, clutching his lean hand into his throat. It was over. Gant, who under the stimulus of his son's graduation had almost regained the vitality of his middle years, relapsed now into whining dotage. The terrible heat came down and smote him. He faced with terror and weariness the long hot trip into the hills again.",1
2922,"Merciful God! he whined. Why did I ever come! O Jesus, how will I ever face that trip again! I can't bear it. I'll die before I get there! It's fearful, it's awful, it's cruel. And he wept weak snuffling sobs.",1
2923,"Eugene took them to Exeter and got them comfortably disposed in a Pullman. He was remaining for a few days to gather his belongings-- the clutter of four years, letters, books, old manuscript, worthless rubbish of every description, for he seemed to inherit Eliza's mania for blind accumulation. Extravagant with money, and unable to husband it, he saved everything else even when his spirit grew sick at the stale and dusty weariness of the past.",1
2924,"Well, son,"" said Eliza, in the quiet moment before departure. Have you thought yet of what you're going to do?""  ""Yes,"" said Gant, wetting his thumb, ""for you've got to shift for yourself from now on. You've had the best education money can buy. The rest is up to you. I'll talk to you in a few days when I see you at home,"" said Eugene.",1
2925,"I'll tell you about it then. Mercifully the train began to move: he kissed them quickly and ran down the aisle. He had nothing to tell them. He was nineteen; he had completed his college course; but he did not know what he was going to do. His father's plan that he should study law and ""enter politics"" had been forgotten since his sophomore year, when it became apparent that the impulse of his life was not toward law. His family felt obscurely that he was an eccentric--""queer,"" they called it--and of an impractical or ""literary"" turn.",1
2926,"Without asking sharply why, they felt the absurdity of clothing this bounding figure, with the wild dark face, in a frock-coat and string tie: he did not exist in business, trade, or law. More vaguely, they classified him as bookish and a dreamer--Eliza referred to him as ""a good scholar,"" which, in fact, he had never been. He had simply performed brilliantly in all things that touched his hunger, and dully, carelessly, and indifferently in all things that did not. No one saw very clearly what he was going to do--he, surely, least of all--but his family, following the tack of his comrades, spoke vaguely and glibly of ""a career in journalism. This meant newspaper work. And, however unsatisfactory this may have been, their inevitable question was drugged for the moment by the glitter of success that had surrounded his life at the university.",1
2927,"But Eugene was untroubled by thought of a goal. He was mad with such ecstasy as he had never known. He was a centaur, moon-eyed and wild of mane, torn apart with hunger for the golden world. He became at times almost incapable of coherent speech. While talking with people, he would whinny suddenly into their startled faces, and leap away, his face contorted with an idiot joy. He would hurl himself squealing through the streets and along the paths, touched with the ecstasy of a thousand unspoken desires. The world lay before him for his picking--full of opulent cities, golden vintages, glorious triumphs, lovely women, full of a thousand unmet and magnificent possibilities. Nothing was dull or tarnished. The strange enchanted coasts were unvisited. He was young and he could never die.",1
2928,"He went back to Pulpit Hill for two or three days of delightful loneliness in the deserted college. He prowled through the empty campus at midnight under the great moons of the late rich Spring; he breathed the thousand rich odors of tree and grass and flower, of the opulent and seductive South; and he felt a delicious sadness when he thought of his departure, and saw there in the moon the thousand phantom shapes of the boys he had known who would come no more. And in the day he went to talk with Vergil Weldon. The old man was charming, confidential, full of wise intimacy, gentle humor. They sat beneath the great trees of his yard and drank iced tea. Eugene was thinking of California, Peru, Asia, Alaska, Europe, Africa, China. But he mentioned Harvard. For him, it was not the name of a university--it was rich magic, wealth, elegance, joy, proud loneliness, rich books and golden browsing; it was an enchanted name like Cairo and Damascus. And he felt somehow that it gave a reason, a goal of profit, to his wild ecstasy.",1
2929,"Yes,"" said Vergil Weldon approvingly. It's the place for you, Mr. Gant. It doesn't matter about the others. They're ready now. But a mind like yours must not be pulled green. You must give it a chance to ripen. There you will find yourself.",1
2930,"And he talked enchantingly about the good free life of the mind, cloistered study, the rich culture of the city, and about the food. They give you food there that a man can eat, Mr. Gant,"" he said. Your mind can do its work on it. Then he spoke of his own student days there, and of the great names of Royce and Everett, and William James.",1
2931,"Eugene looked with passionate devotion at the grand old head, calm, wise and comforting. In a moment of vision, he saw that, for him, here was the last of the heroes, the last of those giants to whom we give the faith of our youth, believing like children that the riddle of our lives may be solved by their quiet judgment. He believed, and no experience, he knew, would ever make him disbelieve, that one of the great lives of his time had unfolded itself quietly in the little college town.",1
2932,"Oh, my old Sophist, he thought. What were all the old philosophies that you borrowed and pranked up to your fancy, to you, who were greater than all? What was the Science of Thinking, to you, who were Thought? What if all your ancient game of metaphysics never touched the dark jungle of my soul? Do you think you have replaced my childhood's God with your Absolute? No, you have only replaced his beard with a mustache, and a glint of demon hawk-eyes. To me, you were above good, above truth, above righteousness. To me, you were the sufficient negation to all your teachings. Whatever you did was, by its doing, right. And now I leave you throned in memory. You will see my dark face burning on your bench no more; the memory of me will grow mixed and broken; new boys will come to win your favor and your praise. But you? Forever fixed, unfading, bright, my lord.",1
2933,"Then, while the old man talked, Eugene leaped suddenly to his feet, and grasped the lean hand tightly in his own. Mr. Weldon! he said. Mr. Weldon! You are a great man! I shall never forget you!",1
2934,"Then, turning, he plunged off blindly down the path. He still loitered, although his baggage had been packed for days. With a desperate pain, he faced departure from that Arcadian wilderness where he had known so much joy. At night he roamed the deserted campus, talking quietly until morning with a handful of students who lingered strangely, as he did, among the ghostly buildings, among the phantoms of lost boys. He could not face a final departure. He said he would return early in autumn for a few days, and at least once a year thereafter.",1
2935,"Then one hot morning, on sudden impulse, he left. As the car that was taking him to Exeter roared down the winding street, under the hot green leafiness of June, he heard, as from the sea-depth of a dream, far-faint, the mellow booming of the campus bell. And suddenly it seemed to him that all the beaten walks were thudding with the footfalls of lost boys, himself among them, running for their class. Then, as he listened, the far bell died away, and the phantom runners thudded into oblivion. Soon the car roared up by Vergil Weldon's house, and as he passed, he saw the old man sitting below his tree.",1
2936,"Eugene stood up in the car and waved his long arm in a gesture of farewell. Good-bye,"" he cried. Good-bye.""  The old man stood up with a quiet salute of parting, slow, calm, eloquently tender.",1
2937,"Then, even while Eugene stood looking back upon the street, the car roared up across the lip of the hill, and drove steeply down into the hot parched countryside below. But as the lost world faded from his sight, Eugene gave a great cry of pain and sadness, for he knew that the elfin door had closed behind him, and that he would never come back again. He saw the vast rich body of the hills, lush with billowing greenery, ripe-bosomed, dappled by far-floating cloud-shadows. But it was, he knew, the end.",1
2938,"Far-forested, the horn-note wound. He was wild with the hunger for release: the vast champaign of earth stretched out for him its limitless seduction. It was the end, the end. It was the beginning of the voyage, the quest of new lands.",1
2939,"Gant was dead. Gant was living, death-in-life. In his big back room at Eliza's he waited death, lost and broken in a semi-life of petulant memory. He hung to life by a decayed filament, a corpse lit by infrequent flares of consciousness. The sudden death whose menace they had faced so long that it had lost its meaning, had never come to him. It had come where they had least expected it-- to Ben. And the conviction which Eugene had had at Ben's death, more than a year and a half before, was now a materialized certainty. The great wild pattern of the family had been broken forever. The partial discipline that had held them together had been destroyed by the death of their brother: the nightmare of waste and loss had destroyed their hope. With an insane fatalism they had surrendered to the savage chaos of life.",1
2940,"Except for Eliza. She was sixty, sound of body and mind, triumphantly healthy. She still ran Dixieland, but she had given up the boarders for roomers, and most of the duties of management she intrusted to an old maid who lived in the house. Eliza devoted most of her time to real estate.",1
2941,"She had, during the past year, got final control of Gant's property. She had begun to sell it immediately and ruthlessly, over his indifferent mutter of protest. She had sold the old house on Woodson Street for $7,000--a good enough price, she had said, considering the neighborhood. But, stark, bare, and raw, stripped of its girdling vines, annex now to a quack's sanitarium for ""nervous diseases,"" the rich labor of their life was gone. In this, more than in anything else, Eugene saw the final  disintegration of his family.",1
2942,"Eliza had also sold a wild tract of mountain farmland for $6,000, fifty acres on the Reynoldsville road for $15,000, and several smaller pieces. Finally she had sold Gant's shop upon the Square for $25,000 to a syndicate of real estate people who were going to erect on the site the town's first ""skyscraper. With this money as capital, she began to ""trade,"" buying, selling, laying down options, in an intricate and bewildering web.  ""Dixieland"" itself had become enormously valuable.",1
2943,"The street which she had foreseen years before had been cut through behind her boundaries: she lacked thirty feet of meeting the golden highway, but she had bought the intervening strip, paying without complaint a stiff price. Since then she had refused, with a puckered smile, an offer of $100,000 for her property. She was obsessed. She talked real estate unendingly. She spent half her time talking to real estate men; they hovered about the house like flesh-flies. She drove off with them several times a day to look at property. As her land investments grew in amount and number, she became insanely niggardly in personal expenditure. She would fret loudly if a light was kept burning in the house, saying that ruin and poverty faced her. She seldom ate unless the food was given to her; she went about the house holding a cup of weak coffee and a crust of bread. A stingy careless breakfast was the only meal to which Luke and Eugene could look forward with any certainty: with angry guffaw and chortle, they ate, wedged in the little pantry--the dining-room had been turned over to the roomers.",1
2944,"Gant was fed and cared for by Helen. She moved back and forth in ceaseless fret between Eliza's house and Hugh Barton's, in constant rhythms of wild energy and depletion, anger, hysteria, weariness and indifference. She had had no children and, it seemed, would have none. For this reason, she had long periods of brooding morbidity, during which she drugged herself with nibbling potations of patent tonics, medicines with a high alcoholic content, home- made wines, and corn whiskey. Her large eyes grew lustreless and dull, her big mouth had a strain of hysteria about it, she would pluck at her long chin and burst suddenly into tears. She talked restlessly, fretfully, incessantly, wasting and losing herself in a net of snarled nerves, in endless gossip, incoherent garrulity about the townsfolk, the neighbors, disease, doctors, hospitals, death.",1
2945,"The deliberate calm of Hugh Barton sometimes goaded her to a frenzy. He would sit at night, oblivious of her tirade, gravely chewing his long cigar, absorbed in his charts, or in a late issue of System or of The American Magazine. This power of losing himself in solitary absorption would madden her. She did not know what she wanted, but his silence before her exasperated indictment of life drove her to frenzy. She would rush at him with a sob of rage, knock the magazine from his hands, and seize his thinning hair in the grip of her long fingers.",1
2946,"You answer when I speak! she cried, panting with hysteria. I'm not going to sit here, night after night, while you sit buried in a story. The idea! The idea! She burst into tears. I might as well have married a dummy. Well, I'm willing to talk to you,"" he protested sourly, ""but nothing I say to you seems to suit you.",1
2947,"What do you want me to say?""  It seemed, indeed, when she was in this temper, that she could not be pleased. She was annoyed and irritable if people agreed carefully with all her utterances; she was annoyed equally by their disagreement and by their silence. A remark about the weather, the most studiously uncontroversial opinion, aroused her annoyance.",1
2948,"Sometimes at night she would weep hysterically upon her pillow, and turn fiercely upon her mate. Leave me! Go away! Get out! I hate you! He would rise obediently and go downstairs, but before he reached the living-room she would call fearfully after him, asking him to return.",1
2949,"She lavished kisses and abuse on him by turns: the mothering tenderness, in which she was drowning for want of a child, she poured out on a dirty little mongrel dog which had trotted in from the streets one night, half-dead from starvation. He was a snarling little brute with a rough black-and-white pelt, and an ugly lift of teeth for every one but his master and mistress, but he had grown waddling-fat upon choice meats and livers; he slept warmly on a velvet cushion and rode out with them, snarling at passers-by. She smothered the little cur with slaps and kisses, devoured him with baby-talk, and hated any one who disliked his mongrel viciousness. But most of her time, her love, her blazing energy, she gave to the care of her father. Her feeling toward Eliza was more bitter than ever: it was one of constant chaffering irritability, mounting at times to hatred. She would rail against her mother for hours:  ""I believe she's gone crazy.",1
2950,"Don't you think so? Sometimes I think we ought to get guardians appointed and keep her under custody. Do you know that I buy almost every bite of food that goes into that house? Do you? If it weren't for me, she'd let him die right under her eyes. Don't you know she would? She's got so stingy she won't even buy food for herself. Why, good heavens!"" she burst out in strong exasperation. It's not my place to do those things. He's her husband, not mine! Do you think it's right? Do you? And she would almost weep with rage.",1
2951,"And she would burst out on Eliza, thus:  ""Mama, in God's name! Are you going to let that poor old man in there die for lack of proper care? Can't you ever get it into your head that papa's a sick man? He's got to have good food and decent treatment.",1
2952,"And Eliza, confused and disturbed, would answer:  ""Why, child! What on earth do you mean? I took him in a big bowl of vegetable soup myself, for his lunch: he ate it all up without stopping. 'Why, pshaw! Mr. Gant,' I said (just to cheer him up), 'I don't believe there can be much wrong with any one with an appetite like that. Why, say,' I said . . . Oh, for heaven's sake!"" cried Helen furiously.",1
2953,"Papa's a sick man. Aren't you ever going to understand that? Surely Ben's death should have taught us something,"" her voice ended in a scream of exasperation.",1
2954,"Gant was a spectre in waxen yellow. His disease, which had thrust out its branches to all parts of his body, gave him an appearance of almost transparent delicacy. His mind was sunken out of life in a dim shadowland: he listened wearily and indifferently to all the brawling clamor around him, crying out and weeping when he felt pain, cold, or hunger, smiling when he was comfortable and at ease. He was taken back to Baltimore two or three times a year now for radium treatments: he had a brief flare of vitality and ease after each visit, but every one knew his relief would be only temporary. His body was a rotten fabric which had thus far miraculously held together.",1
2955,"Meanwhile, Eliza talked incessantly about real estate, bought, sold and traded. About her own ventures she was insanely secretive; she would smile craftily when questioned about them, wink in a knowing fashion, and make a bantering noise in her throat. I'm not telling all I know,"" she said.",1
2956,"This goaded her daughter's bitter curiosity almost past endurance, for, despite her angry mockery, the mania for property had bitten into her and Hugh Barton as well: secretly they respected Eliza's shrewdness and got her advice on property into which he was putting all his surplus earnings. But when Eliza refused to reveal her own investments, the girl would cry out in a baffled hysteria:  ""She has no right to do that! Don't you know she hasn't? It's papa's property just as much as hers, you know. If she should die now, that estate would be in a terrible mess. No one knows what she's done: how much she's bought and sold. I don't think she knows herself. She keeps her notes and papers hidden away in little drawers and boxes. Her distrust and fear had been so great that, much to Eliza's annoyance, she had persuaded Gant, a year or two before, to make a will: he had left $5,000 to each of his five children, and the remainder of his property and money to his wife.",1
2957,"And, as the summer advanced, she again persuaded him to appoint as executors the two people in whose honesty she had the greatest trust: Hugh Barton and Luke Gant. To Luke, who, since his discharge from the navy, had been salesman, in the mountain district, for electrical farm-lighting plants, she said:  ""We're the ones who've always had the interests of the family at heart, and we've had nothing for it. We've been the generous ones, but Eugene and Steve will get it all in the end. 'Gene's had everything: we've had nothing. Now he's talking of going to Harvard. Had you heard about that? His m-m-m-majesty!"" said Luke ironically.",1
2958,"Who's going to p-p-p- pay the bills? Thus, as the summer waned, over the slow horror of Gant's death was waged this ugly warfare of greed and hatred. Steve came in from Indiana; within four days he was insane from whiskey and veronal. He began to follow Eugene around the house, backing him ominously into corners, seizing him belligerently by the arm, as he breathed upon him his foul yellow stench, and spoke to him with maudlin challenge.",1
2959,"I've never had your chance. Every one was down on Stevie. If he'd had the chance some folks have, he'd be right up there with the Big Boys now. And at that, he's got more brains than a lot of people I know who've been to college. You get that, don't you?""  He thrust his pustulate face, foul and snarling, close to Eugene's.",1
2960,"Get away, Steve! Get away! the boy muttered. He tried to move, but his brother blocked him. I tell you to get away, you swine! he screamed suddenly, and he struck the evil face away from him.",1
2961,"Then, as Steve sprawled dazed and witless on the floor, Luke sprang upon him with stammering curse, and, past reason, began to drag him up and down. And Eugene sprang upon Luke to stop him, and all three stammered and cursed and begged and accused, while the roomers huddled at the door, and Eliza wept, calling for help, and Daisy, who was up from the South with her children, wrung her plump hands, moaning ""Oh, they'll kill him! They'll kill him. Have mercy on me and my poor little children, I beg of you. Then the shame, the disgust, the maudlin grievance, the weeping women, the excited men.",1
2962,"You m-m-m-miserable degenerate!"" cried Luke. You c-c-came home because you thought p-p-p-papa would die and leave you a little money. You d-d-don't deserve a penny!""  ""I know what you're trying to do,"" Steve screamed in an agony of suspicion.",1
2963,"You're all against me! You've framed up on me and you're trying to beat me out of my share. He was weeping with genuine rage and fear, with the angry suspicion of a beaten child.",1
2964,"Eugene looked at him with pity and nausea: he was so foul, whipped, and frightened. Then, with a sense of unreal horror and disbelief, he listened while they bawled out their accusations. This disease of money and greed tainted other people, the people in books, not one's own. They were snarling like curs over one bone--their little shares in the money of an unburied dead man who lay, with low moanings of disease, not thirty feet away.",1
2965,"The family drew off in two camps of hostile watchfulness: Helen and Luke on one side and Daisy and Steve, subdued but stubborn, on the other. Eugene, who had no talent for parties, cruised through sidereal space with momentary anchorings to earth. He loafed along the avenue, and lounged in Wood's; he gossiped with the pharmacy rakes; he courted the summer girls on boarding-house porches; he visited Roy Brock in a high mountain village, and lay with a handsome girl in the forest; he went to South Carolina; he was seduced by a dentist's wife at Dixieland. She was a prim ugly woman of forty-three, who wore glasses and had sparse hair. She was a Daughter of the Confederacy and wore the badge constantly on her starched waists.",1
2966,"He thought of her only as a very chill and respectable woman. He played Casino--the only game he knew--with her and the other boarders, and called her ""ma'am. Then one night she took his hand, saying she would show him how to make love to a girl. She tickled the palm, put it around her waist, lifted it to her breast, and plumped over on his shoulder, breathing stertorously through her pinched nostrils and saying, ""God, boy! over and over. He plunged around the dark cool streets until three in the morning, wondering what he would do about it. Then he came back to the sleeping house, and crept on shoeless feet into her room. Fear and disgust were immediate. He climbed the hills to ease his tortured spirit and stayed away from the house for hours. But she would follow him down the halls or open her door suddenly on him, clad in a red kimono. She became very ugly and bitter, and accused him of betraying, dishonoring, and deserting her. She said that where she came from--the good old State of South Carolina--a man who treated a woman in such fashion would get a bullet in him. Eugene thought of new lands. He was in an agony of repentance and guilty abasement: he framed a long plea for pardon and included it in his prayers at night, for he still prayed, not from devout belief, but from the superstition of habit and number, muttering a set formula over sixteen times, while he held his breath. Since childhood he had believed in the magical efficacy of certain numbers--on Sunday he would do only the second thing that came into his head and not the first--and this intricate ritual of number and prayer he was a slave to, not to propitiate God, but to fulfil a mysterious harmonic relation with the universe, or to pay worship to the demonic force that brooded over him. He could not sleep of nights until he did this.",1
2967,"Eliza finally grew suspicious of the woman, picked a quarrel with her, and ejected her. No one said very much to him about going to Harvard. He himself had no very clear reason for going, and only in September, a few days before the beginning of the term, decided to go. He talked about it at intervals during the summer, but, like all his family, he needed the pressure of immediacy to force a decision. He was offered employment on several newspapers in the State, and on the teaching staff of the run-down military academy that topped a pleasant hill two miles from town.",1
2968,"But in his heart he knew he was going to leave. And no one opposed him very much. Helen railed against him at times to Luke, but made only a few indifferent and unfriendly comments to himself about it. Gant moaned wearily, saying:  ""Let him do as he likes. I can't pay out any more money on his education. If he wants to go, his mother must send him. Eliza pursed her lips thoughtfully, made a bantering noise, and said:  ""Hm!  Harvard!",1
2969,"That's mighty big talk, boy. Where are you going to get the money?""  ""I can get it,"" he said darkly. People will lend it to me. No, son,"" she said with instant grave caution.",1
2970,"I don't want you to do anything like that. You mustn't start life by accumulating debts. He was silent, trying to force the terrible sentence through his parched lips.",1
2971,"Then,"" he said finally, ""why can't I pay my way from my share in papa's estate?""  ""Why, child!"" said Eliza angrily. You talk as if we were millionaires. I don't even know that there's going to be any share for anybody. Your papa was persuaded into that against his better judgment,"" she added fretfully.",1
2972,"Eugene began to beat suddenly against his ribs. I want to go! he said. I've got to have it now! Now!""  He was mad with a sense of frustration.",1
2973,I don't want it when I'm rotten! I want it now! To hell with the real estate! I want none of your dirt! I hate it! Let me go! he screamed; and in his fury he began to beat his head against the wall.,1
2974,"Eliza pursed her lips for a moment. Well,"" she said, at length. I'll send you for a year. Then we'll see.",1
2975,"But, two or three days before his departure, Luke, who was taking Gant to Baltimore the next day, thrust a sheet of typed paper into his hand. What is it? he asked, looking at it with sullen suspicion.",1
2976,"Oh, just a little form Hugh wants you to sign, in case anything should happen. It's a release. A release from what?"" said Eugene, staring at it.",1
2977,"Then, as his mind picked its way slowly through the glib jargon of the law, he saw that the paper was an acknowledgment that he had already received the sum of five thousand dollars in consideration of college fees and expenses. He lifted his scowling face to his brother. Luke looked at him for a moment, then burst into a crazy whah-whah, digging him in the ribs. Eugene grinned sullenly, and said:  ""Give me your pen.",1
2978,"He signed the paper and gave it back to his brother with a feeling of sad triumph. Whah-whah! Now you've done it!"" said Luke, with witless guffaw.",1
2979,"Yes,"" said Eugene, ""and you think me a fool for it. But I'd rather be done now than later. That's my release, not yours. He thought of Hugh Barton's grave foxy face.",1
2980,"There was no victory for him there and he knew it. After all, he thought, I have my ticket and the money for my escape in my pocket. Now, I am done with it cleanly. It's a good ending, after all.",1
2981,"When Eliza heard of this occurrence, she protested sharply:  ""Why here! she said. They've no right to do that. The child's still a minor. Your papa always said he intended to give him his education. Then, after a thoughtful pause, she said doubtfully:  ""Well, we'll see, then.",1
2982,"I've promised to send him for a year. In the darkness by the house, Eugene clutched at his throat. He wept for all the lovely people who would not come again.",1
2983,"Eliza stood upon the porch, her hands clasped loosely across her stomach. Eugene was leaving the house and going toward the town. It was the day before his departure; dusk was coming on, the hills were blooming in strange purple dusk. Eliza watched him go.",1
2984,"Spruce up there, boy! she called. Spruce up! Throw your shoulders back!",1
2985,"In the dark he knew that she was smiling tremulously at him, pursing her lips. She caught his low mutter of annoyance:  ""Why, yes,"" she said, nodding briskly. I'd show them! I'd act as if I thought I was Somebody.  Son,"" she said more gravely, with a sudden change from her tremulous banter, ""it worries me to see you walk like that. You'll get lung-trouble as sure as you're born if you go all humped over. That's one thing about your papa; he always carried himself as straight as a rod. Of course, he's not as straight now as he used to be--as the fellow says"" (she smiled tremulously)--""I reckon we all have a tendency to shrink up a little as we get older. But in his young days there wasn't a straighter man in town.",1
2986,"And then the terrible silence came between them again. He had turned sullenly upon her while she talked. Indecisively she stopped, peered down at him with white pursed face, and in that silence, behind the trivial arras of her talk, he heard the bitter song of all her life.",1
2987,"The marvellous hills were blooming in the dusk. Eliza pursed her lips reflectively a moment, then continued: Well, when you get way up there--as the fellow says--in Yankeedom, you want to look up your Uncle Emerson and all your Boston kin. Your Aunt Lucy took a great liking to you when they were down here-- they always said they'd be glad to see any of us if we ever came up--when you're a stranger in a strange land it's mighty good sometimes to have some one you know. And say--when you see your Uncle Emerson, you might just tell him not to be surprised to see me at any time now"" (she nodded pertly at him)--""I reckon I can pick right up and light out the same as the next fellow when I get ready--I may just pack up and come--without saying a word to any one--I'm not going to spend all my days slaving away in the kitchen--it don't pay--if I can turn a couple of trades here this Fall, I may start out to see the world like I always intended to--I was talking to Cash Rankin about it the other day--'Why, Mrs. Gant,' he said, 'if I had your head I'd be a rich man in five years--you're the best trader in this town,' he said. 'Don't you talk to me about any more trades,' I said--'when I get rid of what I've got now I'm going to get out of it, and not even listen to any one who says real-estate to me--we can't take any of it with us, Cash,' I said--'there are no pockets in shrouds and we only need six feet of earth to bury us in the end--so I'm going to pull out and begin to enjoy life--or as the feller says--before it's too late'--'Well, I don't know that I blame you, Mrs. Gant,' he said-- 'I reckon you're right--we can't take any of it with us,' he said-- 'and besides, even if we could, what good would it do us where we're goin'?'--Now here"" (she addressed Eugene with sudden change, with the old looser masculine gesture of her hand)--""here's the thing I'm going to do--you know that lot I told you I owned on Sunset Crescent--",1
2988,And now the terrible silence came between them once again. The marvellous hills were blooming in the dusk. We shall not come again. We never shall come back again.,1
2989,"Without speech now they faced each other, without speech they knew each other. In a moment Eliza turned quickly from him and with the queer unsteady steps with which she had gone out from the room where Ben lay dying, she moved toward the door. He rushed back across the walk and with a single bound took the steps that mounted to the porch. He caught the rough hands that she held clasped across her body, and drew them swiftly, fiercely, to his breast.",1
2990,"Good-bye,"" he muttered harshly. Good-bye!  Good-bye, mama! A wild strange cry, like that of a beast in pain, was torn from his throat. His eyes were blind with tears; he tried to speak, to get into a word, a phrase, all the pain, the beauty, and the wonder of their lives--every step of that terrible voyage which his incredible memory and intuition took back to the dwelling of her womb. But no word came, no word could come; he kept crying hoarsely again and again, ""Good-bye, good-bye. She understood, she knew all he felt and wanted to say, her small weak eyes were wet as his with tears, her face was twisted in the painful grimace of sorrow, and she kept saying:  ""Poor child!",1
2991,"Poor child! Poor child! Then she whispered huskily, faintly:  ""We must try to love one another. The terrible and beautiful sentence, the last, the final wisdom that the earth can give, is remembered at the end, is spoken too late, wearily.",1
2992,"It stands there, awful and untraduced, above the dusty racket of our lives. No forgetting, no forgiving, no denying, no explaining, no hating. O mortal and perishing love, born with this flesh and dying with this brain, your memory will haunt the earth forever.",1
2993,And now the voyage out. Where?    40   The Square lay under blazing moonlight. The fountain pulsed with a steady breezeless jet: the water fell upon the pool with a punctual slap. No one came into the Square.,1
2994,"The chimes of the bank's clock struck the quarter after three as Eugene entered from the northern edge, by Academy Street. He came slowly over past the fire department and the City Hall. On Gant's corner, the Square dipped sharply down toward Niggertown, as if it had been bent at the edge.",1
2995,"Eugene saw his father's name, faded, on the old brick in moonlight. On the stone porch of the shop, the angels held their marble posture. They seemed to have frozen, in the moonlight.",1
2996,"Leaning against the iron railing of the porch, above the sidewalk, a man stood smoking. Troubled and a little afraid, Eugene came over. Slowly, he mounted the long wooden steps, looking carefully at the man's face. It was half-obscured in shadow.",1
2997,"Is there anybody there?"" said Eugene. No one answered. But, as Eugene reached the top, he saw that the man was Ben.  Ben stared at him a moment without speaking.",1
2998,"Although Eugene could not see his face very well under the obscuring shadow of his gray felt hat, he knew that he was scowling. Ben?"" said Eugene doubtfully, faltering a little on the top step. Is it you, Ben?""  ""Yes,"" said Ben.",1
2999,"In a moment, he added in a surly voice:  ""Who did you think it was, you little idiot?""  ""I wasn't sure,"" said Eugene somewhat timidly. I couldn't see your face. They were silent a moment.",1
3000,"Then Eugene, clearing his throat in his embarrassment, said:  ""I thought you were dead, Ben.""  ""Ah-h!"" said Ben contemptuously, jerking his head sharply upward. Listen to this, won't you?""  He drew deeply on his cigarette: the spiral fumes coiled out and melted in the moon-bright silence. No,"" he said in a moment, quietly. No, I am not dead. Eugene came up on the porch and sat down on a limestone base, up- ended.",1
3001,"Ben turned, in a moment, and climbed up on the rail, bending forward comfortably upon his knees. Eugene fumbled in his pockets for a cigarette, with fingers that were stiff and trembling. He was not frightened: he was speechless with wonder and strong eagerness, and afraid to betray his thoughts to ridicule. He lighted a cigarette. Presently he said, painfully, hesitantly, in apology:  ""Ben, are you a ghost?""  Ben did not mock.",1
3002,"No,"" he said. I am not a ghost. There was silence again, while Eugene sought timorously for words.",1
3003,"I hope,"" he began presently, with a small cracked laugh, ""I hope, then, this doesn't mean that I'm crazy?""  ""Why not?"" said Ben, with a swift flickering grin. Of course you're crazy. Then,"" said Eugene slowly, ""I'm imagining all this?""  ""In heaven's name!",1
3004,"Ben cried irritably. How should I know? Imagining all what?""  ""What I mean,"" said Eugene, ""is, are we here talking together, or not?""  ""Don't ask me,"" said Ben.",1
3005,"How should I know? With a strong rustle of marble and a cold sigh of weariness, the angel nearest Eugene moved her stone foot and lifted her arm to a higher balance. The slender lily stipe shook stiffly in her elegant cold fingers.",1
3006,"Did you see that? Eugene cried excitedly. Did I see what?"" said Ben, annoyed.",1
3007,"Th-th-that angel there! Eugene chattered, pointing with a trembling finger. Did you see it move? It lifted its arm. What of it?",1
3008,"Ben asked irritably. It has a right to, hasn't it? You know,"" he added with biting sarcasm, ""there's no law against an angel lifting its arm if it wants to. No, I suppose not,"" Eugene admitted slowly, after a moment.",1
3009,"Only, I've always heard--""  ""Ah!  Do you believe all you hear, fool? Ben cried fiercely. Because,"" he added more calmly, in a moment, drawing on his cigarette, ""you're in a bad way if you do. There was again silence while they smoked.",1
3010,"Then Ben said:  ""When are you leaving, 'Gene?""  ""To-morrow,"" Eugene answered. Do you know why you are going, or are you just taking a ride on the train?""  ""I know! Of course--I know why I'm going! Eugene said angrily, confused. He stopped abruptly, bewildered, chastened. Ben continued to scowl at him. Then, quietly, with humility, Eugene said:  ""No, Ben.  I don't know why I'm going.",1
3011,"Perhaps you're right. Perhaps I just want a ride on the train. When are you coming back, 'Gene?"" said Ben.  ""Why--at the end of the year, I think,"" Eugene answered.",1
3012,"No,"" said Ben, ""you're not. What do you mean, Ben? Eugene said, troubled.",1
3013,"You're not coming back, 'Gene,"" said Ben softly. Do you know that?""  There was a pause. Yes,"" said Eugene, ""I know it. Why aren't you coming back?"" said Ben.  Eugene caught fiercely at the neckband of his shirt with a clawed hand.",1
3014,I want to go! Do you hear! he cried.,1
3015,"Yes,"" said Ben. So did I. Why do you want to go?""  ""There's nothing here for me,"" Eugene muttered.",1
3016,"How long have you felt like this?"" said Ben.  ""Always,"" said Eugene. As long as I can remember. But I didn't know about it until you--""  He stopped.",1
3017,"Until I what?"" said Ben.  There was a pause. You are dead, Ben,"" Eugene muttered. You must be dead. I saw you die, Ben. His voice rose sharply. I tell you, I saw you die. Don't you remember? The front room upstairs that the dentist's wife has now? Don't you remember, Ben?  Coker, Helen, Bessie Gant who nursed you, Mrs. Pert? The oxygen tank? I tried to hold your hands together when they gave it to you. His voice rose to a scream. Don't you remember? I tell you, you are dead, Ben.""  ""Fool,"" said Ben fiercely.",1
3018,"I am not dead. There was a silence. Then,"" said Eugene very slowly, ""which of us is the ghost, I wonder?""  Ben did not answer.",1
3019,"Is this the Square, Ben?  Is it you I'm talking to? Am I really here or not? And is this moonlight in the Square? Has all this happened?""  ""How should I know?"" said Ben again.",1
3020,"Within Gant's shop there was the ponderous tread of marble feet. Eugene leaped up and peered through the broad sheet of Jannadeau's dirty window. Upon his desk the strewn vitals of a watch winked with a thousand tiny points of bluish light. And beyond the jeweller's fenced space, where moonlight streamed into the ware- room through the tall side-window, the angels were walking to and fro like huge wound dolls of stone. The long cold pleats of their raiment rang with brittle clangor; their full decent breasts wagged in stony rhythms, and through the moonlight, with clashing wings the marble cherubim flew round and round. With cold ewe-bleatings the carved lambs grazed stiffly across the moon-drenched aisle.",1
3021,"Do you see it?"" cried Eugene. Do you see it, Ben?""  ""Yes,"" said Ben.  ""What about it? They have a right to, haven't they?""  ""Not here!",1
3022,"Not here!"" said Eugene passionately. It's not right, here! My God, this is the Square! There's the fountain! There's the City Hall! There's the Greek's lunch-room. The bank-chimes struck the half hour.",1
3023,"And there's the bank,"" he cried. That makes no difference,"" said Ben. Yes,"" said Eugene, ""it does! I am thy father's spirit, doomed for a certain term to walk the night--  ""But not here!",1
3024,"Not here, Ben!"" said Eugene. Where?"" said Ben wearily. In Babylon! In Thebes! In all the other places. But not here! Eugene answered with growing passion. There is a place where all things happen! But not here, Ben!""  My gods, with bird-cries in the sun, hang in the sky.",1
3025,"Not here, Ben!  It is not right! Eugene said again. The manifold gods of Babylon. Then, for a moment, Eugene stared at the dark figure on the rail, muttering in protest and disbelief: Ghost!  Ghost!""  ""Fool,"" said Ben again, ""I tell you I am not a ghost.",1
3026,"Then, what are you?"" said Eugene with strong excitement. You are dead, Ben. In a moment, more quietly, he added:  ""Or do men die? How should I know,"" said Ben.  ""They say papa is dying.",1
3027,"Did you know that, Ben?"" Eugene asked. Yes,"" said Ben.  ""They have bought his shop. They are going to tear it down and put up a skyscraper here. Yes,"" said Ben, ""I know it.",1
3028,"We shall not come again. We never shall come back again. Everything is going. Everything changes and passes away. To-morrow I shall be gone and this--"" he stopped.",1
3029,"This--what?"" said Ben. This will be gone or--O God! Did all this happen?"" cried Eugene.",1
3030,"How should I know, fool?"" cried Ben angrily. What happens, Ben? What really happens?"" said Eugene. Can you remember some of the same things that I do? I have forgotten the old faces. Where are they, Ben? What were their names? I forget the names of people I knew for years. I get their faces mixed. I get their heads stuck on other people's bodies. I think one man has said what another said. And I forget--forget. There is something I have lost and have forgotten. I can't remember, Ben.""  ""What do you want to remember?"" said Ben.  A stone, a leaf, an unfound door.",1
3031,"And the forgotten faces. I have forgotten names. I have forgotten faces. And I remember little things,"" said Eugene. I remember the fly I swallowed on the peach, and the little boys on tricycles at Saint Louis, and the mole on Grover's neck, and the Lackawanna freight-car, number 16356, on a siding near Gulfport. Once, in Norfolk, an Australian soldier on his way to France asked me the way to a ship; I remember that man's face. He stared for an answer into the shadow of Ben's face, and then he turned his moon-bright eyes upon the Square.",1
3032,"And for a moment all the silver space was printed with the thousand forms of himself and Ben. There, by the corner in from Academy Street, Eugene watched his own approach; there, by the City Hall, he strode with lifted knees; there, by the curb upon the step, he stood, peopling the night with the great lost legion of himself-- the thousand forms that came, that passed, that wove and shifted in unending change, and that remained unchanging Him. And through the Square, unwoven from lost time, the fierce bright horde of Ben spun in and out its deathless loom. Ben, in a thousand moments, walked the Square: Ben of the lost years, the forgotten days, the unremembered hours; prowled by the moonlit façades; vanished, returned, left and rejoined himself, was one and many--deathless Ben in search of the lost dead lusts, the finished enterprise, the unfound door--unchanging Ben multiplying himself in form, by all the brick façades entering and coming out.",1
3033,"And as Eugene watched the army of himself and Ben, which were not ghosts, and which were lost, he saw himself--his son, his boy, his lost and virgin flesh--come over past the fountain, leaning against the loaded canvas bag, and walking down with rapid crippled stride past Gant's toward Niggertown in young pre-natal dawn. And as he passed the porch where he sat watching, he saw the lost child-face below the lumpy ragged cap, drugged in the magic of unheard music, listening for the far-forested horn-note, the speechless almost captured pass-word. The fast boy-hands folded the fresh sheets, but the fabulous lost face went by, steeped in its incantations.",1
3034,Eugene leaped to the railing. You!  You! My son! My child!  Come back! Come back!,1
3035,"His voice strangled in his throat: the boy had gone, leaving the memory of his bewitched and listening face turned to the hidden world. O lost! And now the Square was thronging with their lost bright shapes, and all the minutes of lost time collected and stood still. Then, shot from them with projectile speed, the Square shrank down the rails of destiny, and was vanished with all things done, with all forgotten shapes of himself and Ben.",1
3036,"And in his vision he saw the fabulous lost cities, buried in the drifted silt of the earth--Thebes, the seven-gated, and all the temples of the Daulian and Phocian lands, and all Oenotria to the Tyrrhene gulf. Sunk in the burial-urn of earth he saw the vanished cultures: the strange sourceless glory of the Incas, the fragments of lost epics upon a broken shard of Gnossic pottery, the buried tombs of the Memphian kings, and imperial dust, wound all about with gold and rotting linen, dead with their thousand bestial gods, their mute unwakened ushabtii, in their finished eternities. He saw the billion living of the earth, the thousand billion dead: seas were withered, deserts flooded, mountains drowned; and gods and demons came out of the South, and ruled above the little rocket-flare of centuries, and sank--came to their Northern Lights of death, the muttering death-flared dusk of the completed gods.",1
3037,"But, amid the fumbling march of races to extinction, the giant rhythms of the earth remained. The seasons passed in their majestic processionals, and germinal Spring returned forever on the land--new crops, new men, new harvests, and new gods. And then the voyages, the search for the happy land. In his moment of terrible vision he saw, in the tortuous ways of a thousand alien places, his foiled quest of himself. And his haunted face was possessed of that obscure and passionate hunger that had woven its shuttle across the seas, that had hung its weft among the Dutch in Pennsylvania, that had darkened his father's eyes to impalpable desire for wrought stone and the head of an angel. Hill-haunted, whose vision of the earth was mountain-walled, he saw the golden cities sicken in his eye, the opulent dark splendors turn to dingy gray. His brain was sick with the million books, his eyes with the million pictures, his body sickened on a hundred princely wines.",1
3038,"And rising from his vision, he cried:  ""I am not there among the cities. I have sought down a million streets, until the goat-cry died within my throat, and I have found no city where I was, no door where I had entered, no place where I had stood. Then, from the edges of moon-bright silence, Ben replied:  ""Fool, why do you look in the streets?""  Then Eugene said:  ""I have eaten and drunk the earth, I have been lost and beaten, and I will go no more.",1
3039,"Fool,"" said Ben, ""what do you want to find?""  ""Myself, and an end to hunger, and the happy land,"" he answered. For I believe in harbors at the end. O Ben, brother, and ghost, and stranger, you who could never speak, give me an answer now!",1
3040,"Then, as he thought, Ben said:  ""There is no happy land. There is no end to hunger. And a stone, a leaf, a door?",1
3041,"Ben?""  Spoke, continued without speaking, to speak. Who are, who never were, Ben, the seeming of my brain, as I of yours, my ghost, my stranger, who died, who never lived, as I? But if, lost seeming of my dreaming brain, you have what I have not--an answer? Silence spoke.",1
3042,"(""I cannot speak of voyages. I belong here. I never got away,"" said Ben.)",1
3043,"Then I of yours the seeming, Ben? Your flesh is dead and buried in these hills: my unimprisoned soul haunts through the million streets of life, living its spectral nightmare of hunger and desire. Where, Ben? Where is the world?""  ""Nowhere,"" Ben said.",1
3044,"YOU are your world. Inevitable catharsis by the threads of chaos. Unswerving punctuality of chance. Apexical summation, from the billion deaths of possibility, of things done.",1
3045,"I shall save one land unvisited,"" said Eugene. Et ego in Arcadia. And as he spoke, he saw that he had left the million bones of cities, the skein of streets. He was alone with Ben, and their feet were planted on darkness, their faces were lit with the cold high terror of the stars.",1
3046,"On the brink of the dark he stood, with only the dream of the cities, the million books, the spectral images of the people he had loved, who had loved him, whom he had known and lost. They will not come again. They never will come back again.",1
3047,"With his feet upon the cliff of darkness, he looked and saw the lights of no cities. It was, he thought, the strong good medicine of death. Is this the end?"" he said. Have I eaten life and have not found him? Then I will voyage no more. Fool,"" said Ben, ""THIS is life.",1
3048,"You have been nowhere. But in the cities?""  ""There are none. There is one voyage, the first, the last, the only one. On coasts more strange than Cipango, in a place more far than Fez, I shall hunt him, the ghost and haunter of myself.",1
3049,"I have lost the blood that fed me; I have died the hundred deaths that lead to life. By the slow thunder of the drums, the flare of dying cities, I have come to this dark place. And this is the true voyage, the good one, the best. And now prepare, my soul, for the beginning hunt. I will plumb seas stranger than those haunted by the Albatross. He stood naked and alone in darkness, far from the lost world of the streets and faces; he stood upon the ramparts of his soul, before the lost land of himself; heard inland murmurs of lost seas, the far interior music of the horns.",1
3050,"The last voyage, the longest, the best. O sudden and impalpable faun, lost in the thickets of myself, I will hunt you down until you cease to haunt my eyes with hunger. I heard your foot-falls in the desert, I saw your shadow in old buried cities, I heard your laughter running down a million streets, but I did not find you there. And no leaf hangs for me in the forest; I shall lift no stone upon the hills; I shall find no door in any city. But in the city of myself, upon the continent of my soul, I shall find the forgotten language, the lost world, a door where I may enter, and music strange as any ever sounded; I shall haunt you, ghost, along the labyrinthine ways until--until? O Ben, my ghost, an answer?",1
3051,"But as he spoke, the phantom years scrolled up their vision, and only the eyes of Ben burned terribly in darkness, without an answer. And day came, and the song of waking birds, and the Square, bathed in the young pearl light of morning. And a wind stirred lightly in the Square, and, as he looked, Ben, like a fume of smoke, was melted into dawn.",1
3052,"And the angels on Gant's porch were frozen in hard marble silence, and at a distance life awoke, and there was a rattle of lean wheels, a slow clangor of shod hoofs. And he heard the whistle wail along the river. Yet, as he stood for the last time by the angels of his father's porch, it seemed as if the Square already were far and lost; or, I should say, he was like a man who stands upon a hill above the town he has left, yet does not say ""The town is near,"" but turns his eyes upon the distant soaring ranges.",1
3053,"BOOK I - THE NATIVE'S RETURN 1. The Drunken Beggar on Horseback It was the hour of twilight on a soft spring day towards the end of April in the year of Our Lord 1929, and George Webber leaned his elbows on the sill of his back window and looked out at what he could see of New York. His eye took in the towering mass of the new hospital at the end of the block, its upper floors set back in terraces, the soaring walls salmon coloured in the evening light. This side of the hospital, and directly opposite, was the lower structure of the annexe, where the nurses and the waitresses lived. In the rest of the block half a dozen old brick houses, squeezed together in a solid row, leaned wearily against each other and showed their backsides to him.",1
3054,"The air was strangely quiet. All the noises of the city were muted here into a distant hum, so unceasing that it seemed to belong to silence. Suddenly, through the open windows at the front of the house came the raucous splutter of a truck starting up at the loading platform of the warehouse across the street. The heavy motor warmed up with a full-throated roar, then there was a grinding clash of gears, and George felt the old house tremble under him as the truck swung out into the street and thundered off. The noise receded, grew fainter, then faded into the general hum, and all was quiet as before.",1
3055,"As George leaned looking out of his back window a nameless happiness welled within, him and he shouted over to the waitresses in the hospital annexe, who were ironing out as usual their two pairs of drawers and their flimsy little dresses. He heard, as from a great distance, the faint shouts of children playing in the streets, and, near at hand, the low voices of the people in the houses. He watched the cool, steep shadows, and saw how the evening light was moving in the little squares of yards, each of which had in it something intimate, familiar, and revealing--a patch of earth in which a pretty woman had been setting out flowers, working earnestly for hours and wearing a big straw hat and canvas gloves; a little plot of new-sown grass, solemnly watered every evening by a man with a square red face and a bald head; a little shed or playhouse or workshop for some business man's spare-time hobby; or a gay-painted table, some easy lounging chairs, and a huge bright-striped garden parasol to cover it, and a good-looking girl who had been sitting there all afternoon reading, with a coat thrown over her shoulders and a tall drink at her side.",1
3056,"Through some enchantment of the quiet and the westering light and the smell of April in the air, it seemed to George that he knew these people all around him. He loved this old house on Twelfth Street, its red brick walls, its rooms of noble height and spaciousness, its old dark woods and floors that creaked; and in the magic of the moment it seemed to be enriched and given a profound and lonely dignity by all the human beings it had sheltered in its ninety years. The house became like a living presence. Every object seemed to have an animate vitality of its own--walls, rooms, chairs, tables, even a half-wet bath towel hanging from the shower ring above the tub, a coat thrown down upon a chair, and his papers, manuscripts, and books scattered about the room in wild confusion.",1
3057,"The simple joy he felt at being once more a part of such familiar things also contained an element of strangeness and unreality. With a sharp stab of wonder he reminded himself, as he had done a hundred times in the last few weeks, that he had really come home again--home to America, home to Manhattan's swarming rock, and home again to love; and his happiness was faintly edged with guilt when he remembered that less than a year before he had gone abroad in anger and despair, seeking to escape what now he had returned to. In his bitter resolution of that spring a year ago, he had wanted most of all to get away from the woman he loved. Esther Jack was much older than he, married and living with her husband and grown daughter. But she had given George her love, and given it so deeply, so exclusively, that he had come to feel himself caught as in a trap. It was from that that he had wanted to escape--that and the shameful memory of their savage quarrels, and a growing madness in himself which had increased in violence as she had tried to hold him. So he had finally left her and fled to Europe. He had gone away to forget her, only to find that he could not; he had done nothing but think of her all the time. The memory of her rosy, jolly face, her essential goodness, her sure and certain talent, and all the hours that they had spent together returned to torture him with new desire and longing for her.",1
3058,"Thus, fleeing from a love that still pursued him, he had become a wanderer in strange countries. He had travelled through England, France, and Germany, had seen countless new sights and people, and--cursing, whoring, drinking, brawling his way across the continent--had had his head bashed in, some teeth knocked out, and his nose broken in a beer-hall fight. And then, in the solitude of convalescence in a Munich hospital, lying in bed upon his back with his ruined face turned upwards towards the ceiling, he had had nothing else to do but think. There, at last, he had learned a little sense. There his madness had gone out of him, and for the first time in many years he had felt at peace within himself.",1
3059,"For he had learned some of the things that every man must find out for himself, and he had found out about them as one has to find out--through error and through trial, through fantasy and illusion, through falsehood and his own damn foolishness, through being mistaken and wrong and an idiot and egotistical and aspiring and hopeful and believing and confused. As he lay there in the hospital he had gone back over his life, and, bit by bit, had extracted from it some of the hard lessons of experience. Each thing he learned was so simple and obvious, once he grasped it, that he wondered why he had not always known it. All together, they wove into a kind of leading thread, trailing backwards through his past, and out into the future. And he thought that now, perhaps, he could begin to shape his life to mastery, for he felt a sense of new direction deep within him, but whither it would take him he could not say.",1
3060,"And what had he learned? A philosopher would not think it much, perhaps, yet in a simple human way it was a good deal. Just by living, by making the thousand little daily choices that his whole complex of heredity, environment, conscious thought, and deep emotion had driven him to make, and by taking the consequences, he had learned that he could not eat his cake and have it, too. He had learned that-in spite of his strange body, so much off scale that it had often made him think himself a creature set apart, he was still the son and brother of all men living. He had learned that he could not devour the earth, that he must know and accept his limitations. He realised that much of his torment of the years past had been self-inflicted, and an inevitable part of growing up. And, most important of all for one who had taken so long to grow up, he thought be had learned not to be the slave of his emotions.",1
3061,"Most of the trouble he had brought upon himself, he saw, had come from leaping down the throat of things. Very well, he would look before he leaped hereafter. The trick was to get his reason and his emotions pulling together in double harness, instead of letting them fly off in opposite directions, tearing him apart between them. He would try to give his head command and see what happened: then if head said, ""Leap!""--he'd leap with all his heart.",1
3062,"And that was where Esther came in, for he had really not meant to come back to her. His head had told him it was better to let their affair end as it had ended. But no sooner had he arrived in New York than his heart told him to call her up--and he had done it. Then they had met again, and after that things followed their own course.",1
3063,"So here he was, back with Esther--the one thing he had once been sure would never happen. Yes, and very happy to be back. That was the queerest part of it. It seemed, perversely, that he ought to be unhappy to be doing what his reason had told him not to do. But he was not. And that was why, as he leaned there musing on his window-sill while the last light faded and the April night came on, a subtle worm was gnawing at his conscience and he wondered darkly at how great a lag there was between his thinking and his actions.",1
3064,"He was twenty-eight years old now, and wise enough to know that there are sometimes reasons of which the reason knows nothing, and that the emotional pattern of one's life, formed and set by years of living, is not to be discarded quite as easily as one may throw away a battered hat or worn-out shoe. Well, he was not the first man to be caught on the horns of this dilemma. Had not even the philosophers themselves been similarly caught? Yes--and then written sage words about it:  ""A foolish consistency,"" Emerson had said, ""is the hobgoblin of little minds.",1
3065,"And great Goethe, accepting the inevitable truth that human growth does not proceed in a straight line to its goal, had compared the development and progress of mankind to the reelings of a drunken beggar on horseback. What was important, perhaps, was not that the beggar was drunk and reeling, but that he was mounted on his horse, and, however unsteadily, was going somewhere.",1
3066,"This thought was comforting to George, and he pondered it for some time, yet it did not altogether remove the edge of guilt that faintly tinged his contentment. There was still a possible flaw in the argument: His inconsistency in coming back-to Esther--was it wise or foolish?...Must the beggar on horseback for ever reel? Esther awoke as quick and sudden as a bird. She lay upon her back and stared up at the ceiling straight and wide. This was her body and her flesh, she was alive and ready in a moment.",1
3067,"She thought at once of George. Their reunion had been a joyous re-discovery of love, and all things were made new again. They had taken up the broken fragments of their life and joined them together with all the intensity and beauty that they had known in the best days before he went away. The madness that bad nearly wrecked them both had now gone out of him entirely. He was' still full of his, unpredictable moods and fancies, but she had not seen a trace of the old black fury that used to make him lash about and beat his knuckles bloody against the wall. Since he returned he had seemed quieter, surer, in better control of himself, and in everything he did he acted as if he wanted to show her that he loved her. She had never known such perfect happiness. Life was good.",1
3068,"Outside, on Park Avenue, the people had begun to move along the pavements once more, the streets of the city began to fill and thicken. Upon the table by her bed the little dock ticked eagerly its pulse of time as if it hurried forward for ever like a child towards some imagined joy, and a clock struck slowly in the house with a measured, solemn chime. The morning sun steeped each object in her room with casual light, and in her heart she said, ""It is now. Nora brought coffee and hot rolls, and Esther read the paper.",1
3069,"She read the gossip of the theatre, and she read the names of the cast that had been engaged for the new German play that the Community Guild was going to do in the autumn, and she read that ""Miss Esther Jack has been engaged to design the show"". She laughed because they called her ""Miss"", and because she could see the horrified look on his face when he read it, and because she remembered his expression when the little tailor thought she was his wife, and because it gave her so much pleasure to see her name in the paper--""Miss Esther Jack, whose work has won her recognition as one of the foremost modern designers. She was feeling gay and happy and pleased with herself, so she put the paper in her bag, together with some other clippings she had saved, and took them with her when she went down-town to Twelfth Street for her daily visit to George.",1
3070,"She handed them to him, and sat opposite to watch his face as he read them. She remembered all the things they had written about her work:  ""...subtle, searching, and hushed, with a wry and rueful humour of its own...""  ""...made these old eyes shine by its deft, sure touch of whimsey as nothing else in this prodigal season of dramatic husks has done...""  ""...the gay insouciance of her unmannered settings, touched with those qualities which we have come to expect in all her ardent services to that sometimes too ungrateful jade, the drama...""  ""...the excellent fooling that is implicit in these droll sets, elvishly sly, mocking, and, need we add or make apology for adding, expert?...""  She could hardly keep from laughing at the scornful twist of his mouth and the mocking tone of his comment as he bit off the phrases. 'Elvishly sly!' Now isn't that too God-damned delightful! he said with mincing precision. 'Made these old eyes shine!' Why, the quaint little bastard!...'That sometimes too ungrateful jade!' Oh, deary me, now!...'And need we add--!' I am swooning, sweetheart: pass the garlic!",1
3071,"He threw the papers on the floor with an air of disgust and turned to her with a look of mock sternness that crinkled the corners of his eyes. Well,"" he said, ""do I get fed, or must I starve here while you wallow in this bilge? She could control herself no longer and shrieked with glee.",1
3072,"I didn't do it! she gasped. I didn't write it! I can't help it if they write like that! Isn't it awful? Yes, and you hate it, don't you?",1
3073,"he said. You lap it up! You arc sitting there licking your lips over it now, gloating on it, and on my hunger! Don't you know, woman, that I haven't had a bite to eat all day? Do I get fed, or not? Will you put your deft whimsey in a steak?""  ""Yes,"" she said.",1
3074,"Would you like a steak?""  ""Will you make these old eyes shine with a chop and a delicate dressing of young onions?""  ""Yes,"" she said. Yes.""  He came over and put his arms about her, his eyes searching hers in a look of love and hunger. Will you make me one of your causes that is subtle, searching, and hushed?""  ""Yes,"" she said.",1
3075,"Whatever you like, I will make it for you. Why will you make it for me?"" he asked. It was like a ritual that both of them knew, and they fastened upon each word and answer because they were so eager to hear it from each other.",1
3076,"Because I love you. Because I want to feed you and to love you. Will it be good?"" he said.",1
3077,"It will be so good that there will be no words to tell its goodness,"" she said. It will be good because I am so good and beautiful, and because I can do everything better than any other woman you will ever know, and because I love you with all my heart and soul, and want to be a part of you. Will this great love get into the food you cook for me?""  ""It will be in every morsel that you eat.",1
3078,"It will feed your hunger as you've never been fed before. It will be like a living miracle, and will make you better and richer as long as you live. You will never forget it. It will be a glory and a triumph. Then this will be such food as no one ever ate before,"" he said.",1
3079,"Yes,"" she said.-""It will be.  And it was so. There was never anything like it in the world before. April had come back again.",1
3080,"So now they were together. But things were not quite the same between them as they had once been. Even on the surface they were different. No longer now for them was there a single tenement and dwelling place. From the first day of his return he had flatly refused to go back to the house on Waverly Place which the two of them had previously shared for work and love and living. Instead, he had taken these two large rooms on Twelfth Street, which occupied the whole second floor of the house and could be made into one enormous room by opening the sliding doors between them. There was also a tiny kitchen, just big enough to turn around in. The whole arrangement suited George perfectly because it gave him both space and privacy. Here Esther could come and go as she liked; here they could be alone together whenever they wished; here they could feed at the heart of love.",1
3081,"The most important thing about it, however, was that this was his place, not theirs, and that fact re-established their relations on a different level. Henceforth he was determined not to let his life and love be one. She had her world of the theatre and of her rich friends which he did not want to belong to, and he had his world of writing which he would have to manage alone. He would keep love a thing apart, and safeguard to himself the mastery of his life, his separate soul, his own integrity.",1
3082,"Would she accept this compromise? Would she take his love, but leave him free to live his life and do his work? That was the way he told her it must be, and she said yes, she understood. But could she do it? Was it in a woman's nature to be content with all that a man could give her, and not for ever want what was not his to give? Already there were little portents that made him begin to doubt it.",1
3083,"One morning when she came to see him and was telling him with spirit and great good humour about a little comedy she had witnessed in the street, suddenly she stopped short in the middle of it, a cloud passed over her face, her eyes became troubled, and she turned to him and said:  ""You do love me, don't you, George?""  ""Yes,"" he said. Of course. You know I do. Will you never leave me again?",1
3084,"she asked, a little breathless. Will you go on loving me for ever? Her abrupt change of mood and her easy assumption that he or any human being could honestly pledge himself to anyone or anything for ever struck him as ludicrous, and he laughed.",1
3085,"She made an impatient gesture with her hand. Don't laugh, George,"" she said. I need to know. Tell me. Will you go on loving me for ever? Her seriousness, and the impossibility of giving her an answer annoyed him now, and he rose from his chair, stared down blankly at her for a moment, and then began pacing back and forth across the room.",1
3086,"He paused once or twice and turned to her as if to speak, but, finding it hard to say what he wanted to say, he resumed his nervous pacing. Esther followed him with her eyes; their expression betraying her mixed feelings, in which amusement and exasperation were giving way to alarm. What have I done now?"" she thought. God, was there ever anybody like him! You never can tell what he'll do! All I did was ask him a simple question and he acts like this! Still, it's better than the way he used to act. He used to blow up and call me vile names. Now he just stews in his own juice and I can't tell what he's thinking. Look at him--pacing like a wild animal in a cage, like a temperamental and introspective monkey!",1
3087,"As a matter of fact, in moments of excitement George did look rather like a monkey. Barrel-chested, with broad, heavy shoulders, he walked with a slight stoop, letting his arms swing loosely, and they were so long that they dangled almost to the knees, the big hands and spatulate fingers curving deeply in like paws. His head, set down solidly upon a short neck, was carried somewhat forward with a thrusting movement, so that his whole figure had a prowling and half-crouching posture. He looked even shorter than he was, for, although he was an inch or two above the middle height, around five feet nine or ten, his legs were not quite proportionate to the upper part of his body. Moreover, his features were small--somewhat pug-nosed, the eyes set very deep in beneath heavy brows, the forehead rather low, the hair beginning not far above the brows. And when he was agitated or interested in something, he had the trick of peering upward with a kind of packed attentiveness, and this, together with his general posture, the head thrust forward, the body prowling downwards, gave him a distinctly simian appearance. It was easy to see why some of his friends called him Monk.",1
3088,"Esther watched him a minute or two, feeling disappointed and hurt that he had not answered her. He stopped by the front window and stood looking out, and she went over to him and quietly put her arm through his. She saw the vein swell in his temple, and knew there was no use in speaking.",1
3089,"Outside, the little Jewish tailors were coming from the office of their union next door and were standing in the street. They were pale, dirty, and greasy, and very much alive. They shouted and gesticulated at one another, they stroked each other gently on the cheek in mounting fury, saying tenderly in a throttled voice: ""Nah! Nah! Nah! Then, still smiling in their rage, they began to slap each other gently in the face with itching finger-tips. At length they screamed and dealt each other stinging slaps. Others cursed and shouted, some laughed, and a few said nothing, but stood darkly, sombrely apart, feeding upon their entrails.",1
3090,"Then the young Irish cops charged in among them. There was something bought and corrupt about their look. They had brutal and brainless faces, full of pride. Their jaws were loose and coarse, they chewed gum constantly as they shoved and thrust their way along, and they kept saying:  ""Break it up, now!",1
3091,Break it up! All right! Keep movin'!,1
3092,"The motors roared by like projectiles, and people were passing along the pavement. There were the faces George and Esther had never seen before, and there were the faces they had always seen, everywhere: always different, they never changed; they welled up from the sourceless springs of life with unending fecundity, with limitless variety, with incessant movement, and with the monotony of everlasting repetition. There were the three girl-friends who pass along the streets of life for ever. One had a cruel and sensual face, she wore glasses, and her mouth was hard and vulgar. Another had the great nose and the little bony features of a rat. The face of the third was full and loose, jeering with fat rouged lips and oily volutes of the nostrils. And when they laughed, there was no warmth or joy in the sound: high, shrill, ugly, and hysterical, their laughter only asked the earth to notice them.",1
3093,"In the street the children played. They were dark and strong and violent, aping talk and toughness from their elders. They leaped on one another and hurled the weakest to the pavement. The policemen herded the noisy little tailors along before them, and they went away. The sky was blue and young and vital, there were no clouds in it; the trees were budding into leaf; the sunlight fell into the street, upon all the people there, with an innocent and fearless life.",1
3094,"Esther glanced at George and saw his face grow twisted as he looked. He wanted to say to her that we are all savage, foolish, violent, and mistaken; that, full of our fear and confusion, we walk in ignorance upon the living and beautiful earth, breathing young, vital air and bathing in the light of morning, seeing it not because of the murder in our hearts. But he did not say these things. Wearily he turned away from the window.",1
3095,"There's for ever,"" he said. There's your for ever. 2.",1
3096,"Fame's First Wooing In spite of the colourings of guilt that often tinged his brighter moods, George was happier than he had ever been. There can be no doubt about that. He exulted in the fact. The old madness had gone out of him, and for long stretches at a time he was now buoyed up by the glorious belief--not by any means a new one with him, though it was much stronger now than it had ever been before--that he was at last in triumphant control of his destiny. From his early childhood, when he was living like an orphan with his Joyner relatives back in Libya Hill, he had dreamed that one day he would go to New York and there find love and fame and fortune. For several years New York had been the place that he called home, and love was his already; and now he felt, with the assurance of deep conviction, that the time for fame and fortune was at hand.",1
3097,"Anyone is happy who confidently awaits the fulfilment of his highest dreams, and in that way George Was happy. And, like most of us when things are going well, he took the credit wholly to himself. It was not chance or luck or any blind confluence of events that had produced the change in his spirits: his contentment and sense of mastery were the reward of his own singular and peculiar merit, and no more than his just due. Nevertheless fortune had played a central part in his transformation. A most incredible thing had happened.",1
3098,"He had been back in New York only a few days when Lulu Scudder, the literary agent, telephoned him in great excitement. The publishing house of James Rodney & Co. was interested in his manuscript, and Foxhall Edwards, the distinguished editor of this great house, wanted to talk to him about it. Of course, you couldn't tell about these things, but it was always a good idea to strike while the iron was hot. Could he go over right away to see Edwards?  As he made his way uptown George told himself that it was silly to be excited, that probably nothing would come of it.",1
3099,"Hadn't one publisher already turned the book down, saying that it was no novel? That publisher had even written---and the words of his rejection had seared themselves in. George's brain--""The novel form is not adapted to such talents, as you have. And it was still the same manuscript. Not a line of it had been changed, not a word cut, in spite of hints from Esther and Miss Scudder that it was too long for any publisher to handle. He had stubbornly refused to alter it, insisting that it would have to be printed as it was or not at all. And he had left the manuscript with Miss Scudder and gone away to Europe, convinced that her efforts to find a publisher would prove futile.",1
3100,"All the time he was abroad it had nauseated him to think of his manuscript, of the years of work and sleepless nights, he had put into it, and of the high hopes that bad sustained him through it; and he had tried, not to think of it, convinced now that it was no good, that he himself was no good, and that all his hot ambitions and his dreams of fame were the vapourings of a shoddy aesthete without talent. In this, he told himself, he was just like most of the other piddling instructors at the School for Utility Cultures, from which he had fled, and to which he would return to resume his classes in English composition when his leave of absence expired. They talked for ever about the great books they were writing, or were going to write, because, like him, they needed so desperately to find some avenue of escape from the dreary round of teaching, reading themes, grading papers, and trying to strike a spark in minds that had no flint in them. He had stayed in Europe almost nine months, and no word had come from Miss Scudder, so he had felt confirmed in all his darkest forebodings.",1
3101,"But now she said the Rodney people were interested. Well, they had taken their time about it. And what did ""interested"" mean? Very likely they would tell him they had detected in the book some slight traces of a talent which, with careful nursing, could be schooled to produce, in time, a publishable book. He had heard that publishers sometimes had a weather eye for this sort of thing and that they would often string an aspiring author along for years, giving him just the necessary degree, of encouragement to keep him from abandoning hope altogether and to make him think that they had faith in his great future if only he would go on writing book after rejected book until he ""found himself"". Well, he'd show them that he was not their fool! Not by so much as a flicker of an eyelash would he betray his disappointment, and he would commit himself to nothing!",1
3102,"If the traffic policeman on the corner noticed a strange young man in front of the office of James Rodney & Co. that morning, he would never have guessed at the core of firm resolution with which this young man had tried to steel himself for the interview that lay before him. If the policeman saw him at all, he probably observed him with misgiving, wondering whether he ought not to intervene to prevent the commission of a felony, or at any rate whether he ought not to speak to the young man and hold him in conversation until the ambulance could arrive and take him to Bellevue for observation. For, as the young man approached the building at a rapid, loping stride, a stern scowl upon his face and his lips set in a grim line, he had hardly crossed the street and set his foot upon the kerb before the publisher's building when his step faltered, he stopped and looked about him as if not knowing what to do, and then, in evident confusion, forced himself to go on. ' But now his movements were uncertain; as if his legs obeyed his will with great reluctance. He lunged ahead, then stopped, then lunged again and made for the door, only to halt again in a paroxysm of indecision as he came up to it. He stood there facing the door for a moment, clenching and unclenching his hands, then looked about him quickly, suspiciously, as though he expected to find somebody watching him. At last, with a slight shudder of resolution, he thrust his hands deep into his pockets, turned deliberately, and walked on past the door.",1
3103,"And now he moved slowly, the line of his mouth set grimmer than before, and his head was carried stiffly forward from the shoulders as if he were trying to hold himself to the course he had decided upon by focusing on some distant object straight before him. But all the while, as he went along before the entrance and the show windows filled with books which flanked it on both sides, he peered sharply out of the corner of his eye like a spy who had to find out what was going on inside the building without letting the passers-by observe his interest. He walked to the end of the block and turned about and then came back, and again as he passed in front of the publishing house he kept his face fixed straight ahead and looked stealthily out of the corner of his eye. For fifteen or twenty minutes he repeated this strange manoeuvred, and each time as he approached the door he-would hesitate and half turn as if about to enter, and then abruptly go on as before.",1
3104,"Finally, as he came abreast of the entrance for perhaps the fiftieth time, he quickened his stride and seized the door-knob--but at once, as though it had given him an electric shock, he snatched his hand away and backed off, and stood on the kerb looking up at the house of James Rodney & Co. For several minutes more he stood there, shifting uneasily on his feet and watching all the upper windows as for a sign. Then, suddenly, his jaw muscles tightened, he stuck out his under lip in desperate resolve, and he bolted across the pavement, hurled himself against the door, and disappeared inside.",1
3105,"An hour later, if the policeman was still on duty at the corner, he was no doubt as puzzled and mystified as before by the young man's behaviour as he emerged from the building. He came out slowly, walking mechanically, a dazed look on his face, and in one of his hands, which dangled loosely at his sides, he held a crumpled slip of yellow paper. He emerged from the office of James Rodney & Co. like a man walking in a trance. With the slow and thoughtless movements of an automaton, he turned his steps uptown, and, still with the rapt and dazed look upon his face, he headed north and disappeared into the crowd..",1
3106,"It was, late afternoon and the shadows were slanting swiftly eastwards when George Webber came to his senses somewhere in the wilds of the upper Bronx. How he got there he never knew. All he could remember was that suddenly he felt hungry and stopped and looked about him and realized where he was. His dazed look gave way to one of amazement and incredulity, and his mouth began W stretch in a broad grin. In his hand he still held the rectangular slip of crisp yellow paper, and slowly he smoothed out the wrinkles and examined it carefully.",1
3107,"It was a cheque for five hundred dollars. His book bad been accepted, and this was an advance against his royalties. So he was happier than he had ever been in all his life. Fame, at last, was knocking at his door and wooing him with her sweet blandishments, and he lived in a kind of glorious delirium. The next weeks and months were filled with the excitement of the impending event. The book would not be published till the autumn, but meanwhile there was much work to do. Foxhall Edwards had made some suggestions for cutting and revising the manuscript, and, although George at first objected, he surprised himself in the end by agreeing with Edwards, and he undertook to do what Edwards wanted.",1
3108,"George had called his novel, Home to Our Mountains, and in it he had packed everything he knew about his home town in Old Catawba and the people there. He had distilled every line of it out of his own experience of life. And, now that the issue was decided, he sometimes trembled when he thought that it would be only a matter of months before the whole world knew what he had written. He loathed the thought of giving pain to anyone, and that he might do so had never occurred to him till now. But now it was out of his hands, and he began to feel uneasy. Of course it was fiction, but it was made as all honest fiction must be, from the stuff of human life. Some people might recognize themselves, and be offended, and then what would he do? Would he have to go around in smoked glasses and false whiskers? He comforted himself with the hope that his characterisations were not so true as, in another mood, he liked to think they, were, and he thought that perhaps no one would notice anything.",1
3109,"Rodney's Magazine, too, had become interested in the young author and was going to publish a story, a chapter from the book, in their next number. This news added immensely to his excitement. He was eager to see his name in print, and in the happy interval of expectancy he felt like a kind of universal Don Juan, for he literally loved everybody--his fellow instructors at the school, his drab students, the little shopkeepers in all the stores, even the nameless hordes that thronged the streets. Rodney's, of course, was the greatest and the finest publishing house in all the world, and Foxhall Edwards was the greatest editor and the finest man that ever was. George had liked him instinctively from the first, and now, like an old and intimate friend, he was calling him Fox. George knew that Fox believed in him, and the editor's faith and confidence, coming as it had come, at a time when George had given up all hope, restored his self-respect and charged him with energy for new work.",1
3110,"Already his next novel was begun and was beginning to take shape within him. He would soon have to get it out of him. He dreaded the prospect of buckling down in earnest to write it, for he knew the agony of it. It was like demoniacal possession, driving him with an alien force much greater than his own. While the fury of creation was upon him, it meant sixty cigarettes a day, twenty cups of coffee, meals snatched anyhow and anywhere and at whatever time of day or night he happened to remember he was hungry. It meant sleeplessness, and miles of walking to bring on the physical fatigue without which he could not sleep, then nightmares, nerves, and exhaustion in the morning. As he said to Fox:  ""There are better ways to write a book, but this, God help me, is mine, and you'll have to learn to put up with it.",1
3111,"When Rodney's Magazine came out with the story, George fully expected convulsions of the earth, falling meteors, suspension of traffic in the streets, and a general strike. But nothing happened. A few of his friends mentioned it, but that was all. For several days he felt let down, but then his common sense reassured him that people couldn't really tell much about a new author from a short piece in a magazine. The book would show them who he was and what he could do. It would be different then. He could afford to wait a little longer for the fame which he was certain would soon be his.",1
3112,"It was not until later, after the first excitement had worn off and George had become accustomed to the novelty of being an author whose book was actually going to be published, that he began to learn a little about the unknown world of publishing and the people who inhabit it--and not till then did he begin to understand and appreciate the teal quality of Fox Edwards. And it was through Otto Hauser--so much like Fox in his essential integrity, so sharply contrasted to him in other respects--that George got his first real insight into the character of his editor. Hausa Was a reader at Rodney's, and probably the best publisher's reader in America. He might have been a publisher's editor--a rare and good one--had he been driven forward by ambition, enthusiasm, daring, tenacious resolution, and that eagerness to seek and find the best which a great editor must have. But Hauser was content to spend his days reading ridiculous manuscripts written by ridiculous people on all sorts of ridiculous subjects ""The Breast Stroke,"" ""Rock Gardens for Everybody,"" ""The Life and Times of Lydia Pinkham,"" ""The New Age of Plenty""--and once in a while something that had the fire of passion, the spark of genius, the glow of truth.",1
3113,"Otto Hauser lived in a tiny apartment near First Avenue, and he invited George to drop in one evening. George went, and they spent the evening talking. After that he returned again and again because he liked Otto, and also because he was puzzled by the contradictions of his qualities, especially by something aloof, impersonal, and withdrawing in his nature which seemed so out of place beside the clear and positive elements in his character.",1
3114,"Otto did all the housekeeping himself. He had tried having cleaning women in from time to time, but eventually he had dispensed entirely with their services. 'They were not clean and tidy enough to suit him, and their casual and haphazard disarrangements of objects that had been placed exactly where he wanted them annoyed his order-loving soul. He hated clutter. He had only a few books--a shelf or two--most of them the latest publications of the house of Rodney, and a few volumes sent him by other publishers. Usually he gave his books away as soon as he finished reading them because he hated clutter, and books made clutter. Sometimes he wondered if he didn't hate books, too. Certainly he didn't like to have many of them around: the sight of them irritated him.",1
3115,"George found him a curious enigma. Otto Hauser was possessed of remarkable gifts, yet he was almost wholly lacking in those qualities which cause a man to ""get on"" in the world. In fact, he didn't want to ""get on"". He had a horror of ""getting on"", of going any further than he bad already gone. He wanted to be a publisher's reader, and nothing more. At James Rodney & Co. he did the work they put into his hands. He did punctiliously what he was required to do. He gave his word, when he was asked to give it, with the complete integrity of his quiet soul, the unerring rightness of his judgment, the utter finality of his Germanic spirit. But beyond that he would not go.",1
3116,"When one of the editors at Rodney's, of whom there were several besides Foxhall Edwards, asked Hauser for his opinion, the ensuing conversation would go something like this:  ""You have read the manuscript? Yes,"" said Hauser, ""I have read it. What did you think of it?""  ""I thought it was without merit.",1
3117,"Then you do not recommend its publication?""  ""No, I do not think it is worth publishing.  Or:  ""Did you read that manuscript?",1
3118,"Yes,"" Hauser would say. I read it. Well, what did you think of it?",1
3119,"(Confound it, can't the fellow say what he thinks without having to be asked all the timer)""  ""I think it is a work of genius. Incredulously: ""You do!""  ""I do, yes. To my mind there is no question about it. But look here, Hauser--"" excitedly--""if what you say is true, this boy--the fellow who wrote it--why, he's just a kid--no one ever heard of him before--comes from somewhere out West--Nebraska, Iowa, one of those places--never been anywhere, apparently--if what you say is true, we've made a discovery!",1
3120,"I suppose you have. Yes. The book is a work of genius. But--(Damn it all, what's wrong with the man anyway?",1
3121,"Here he makes a discovery like this--an astounding statement of this sort--and shows no more enthusiasm than if he were discussing a cabbage head!)--but, see here, then! You--you mean there's something wrong with it?""  ""No, I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I think it is a magnificent piece of writing. But--(Good Lord, the fellow is a queer fish!)--but you mean to say that--that perhaps it's not suitable for publication in its present form?",1
3122,"No. I think it's eminently publishable. But it's overwritten, isn't it?""  ""It is overwritten.",1
3123,"Yes.""  ""I thought so, too,"" said the editor shrewdly. Of course, the fellow shows he knows very little about writing. He doesn't know how he does it, he repeats himself continually, he is childish and exuberant and extravagant, and he does ten times too much of everything.. We have a hundred other writers who know more about writing than he does. I suppose we have, yes,"" Hauser agreed.",1
3124,"Nevertheless, he is a man of genius, and they are not. His, book is a work of genius, and theirs are not. Then you think we ought to publish him?""  ""I think so, yes.",1
3125,"But--(Ah, here's the catch, maybe--the thing he's holding back on!)--but you think this is all he has to say?--that he's written himself out in this one book?--that he'll never be able to write another?""  ""No. I think nothing of the sort. I can't say, of course. They may kill him, as they often do----""  ""(God, what a gloomy Gus the fellow is!)",1
3126,"--but on the basis of this book, I should say there's no danger of his running dry. He should have fifty books in him. But--(Good Lord!",1
3127,"What is the catch?)--but then you mean you don't think it's time for such a book as this in America yet? No, I don't mean that. I think it is time. Why?""  ""Because it has happened.",1
3128,Iris always time when it happens. But some of our best critics say it's not time. I know they do.,1
3129,"However, they are wrong. It is simply not their time, that's all. How do you mean?""  ""I mean, their time is critic's time.",1
3130,"The book is creator's time. The two times are not the same. You think, then, that the critics are behind the time?""  ""They are behind creator's time, yes.",1
3131,"Then they may not see this book as the work of genius which you say it is. Do you think they will?""  ""I can't say. Perhaps not. However, it doesn't matter. Doesn't matter!",1
3132,"Why, what do you mean?""  ""I mean that the thing is good, and cannot be destroyed. Therefore it doesn't matter what anyone says. Then--Good Lord, Hauser!--if what you say is true, we've made a great discovery!""  ""I think you have.",1
3133,"Yes. But--but--is that all you have to say?""  ""I think so, yes. What else is there to say?""  Baffled: ""Nothing--only, I should think you would be excited about it!",1
3134,"Then, completely defeated and resigned: ""Oh, all right! All right, Hauser! Thanks very much!",1
3135,"The people at Rodney's couldn't understand it. They didn't know what to make of it. Finally, they had given up trying, all except Fox Edwards--and Fox would never give up trying to understand anything. Fox still came by Hauser's office--his little cell--and looked in on him. Fox's old grey hat would be pushed back on his head, for he never took it off when he worked, and there would be a look of troubled wonder in his sea-pale eyes as he bent over and stooped and craned and stared at Hauser, as if he were regarding for the first time some fantastic monster from the marine jungles of the ocean. Then he would turn and walk away, hands hanging to his coat lapels, and in his eyes there would be a look of utter astonishment.",1
3136,"Fox couldn't understand it yet. As for Hauser himself, he had no answers, nothing to tell them. It was not until George Webber had become well acquainted with both men that be began to penetrate the mystery. Foxhall Edwards and Otto Hauser--to know them both, to see them working in the same office, each in his own way, was to understand them both as perhaps neither could have been understood completely by himself. Each man, by being what he was, revealed to George the secret springs of character which had made the two of them so much alike--and so utterly different.",1
3137,"There may have been a time when an intense and steady flame had been alive in the quiet depths of Otto Hauser's spirit. But that was before he knew what it was like to be a great editor. Now he had seen it for himself, and he wanted none of it. For ten years he had watched Fox Edwards, and he well knew what was needed: the pure flame living in the midst of darkness; the constant, quiet, and relentless effort of the will to accomplish what the pure flame burned for, what the spirit knew; the unspoken agony of that constant effort as it fought to win through to its clear purpose and somehow to subdue the world's blind and brutal force of ignorance, hostility, prejudice, and intolerance which were opposed to it--the fools of age, the fools of prudery, the fools of genteelness, fogyism, and nice-Nellyism, the fools of bigotry, Philistinism, jealousy, and envy, and, worst of all, the utter, sheer damn fools of nature!",1
3138,"Oh, to burn so, so to be consumed, exhausted, spent by the passion of this constant flame! And for what? For what? And why? Because some obscure kid from Tennessee, some tenant farmer's son from Georgia, or some country doctor's boy in North Dakota--untitled, unpedigreed, unhallowed by fools' standards--had been touched with genius, and so had striven to give a tongue to the high passion of his loneliness, to wrest from his locked spirit his soul's language and a portion of the tongue of his unuttered brothers, to find a channel in the blind immensity of this harsh land for the pent tides of his creation, and to make, perhaps, in this howling wilderness of life some carving and some dwelling of his own--all this before the world's fool-bigotry, fool-ignorance, fool-cowardice, fool-faddism, fool-mockery, fool-stylism, and fool-hatred for anyone who was not corrupted, beaten, and a fool had either quenched the hot, burning passion with ridicule, contempt, denial, and oblivion, or else corrupted the strong will with the pollutions of fool-success. It was for this that such as Fox must burn and suffer--to keep that flame' of agony alive in the spirit of some inspired and stricken boy until the world of fools had taken it into their custody, and betrayed it!",1
3139,"Otto Hauser had seen it all. And in the end what was the reward for such a one as Fox? To achieve the lonely and unhoped-for victories one by one, and to see the very fools who had denied them acclaim them as their own. To lapse again to search, to silence, and to waiting while fools greedily pocketed as their own the coin of one man's spirit, proudly hailed as their discovery the treasure of another's exploration, loudly celebrated their own vision as they took unto themselves the fulfilment of another's prophecy. Ah, the heart must break at last--the heart of Fox, as well as the heart of genius, the lost boy; the frail, small heart of man must falter, stop at last from beating; but the heart of folly would beat on for ever.",1
3140,"So Otto Hauser would have none of it. He would grow hot over nothing. He would try to see the truth for himself, and let it go at that.",1
3141,"This was Otto Hauser as George came to know him. In the confidence of friendship Otto held up a mirror to his own soul, affording a clear, unposed reflection of his quiet, unassuming, and baffling integrity; but in the same mirror he also revealed, without quite being aware of it, the stronger and more shining image of Fox Edwards. George knew how fortunate he was to have as his editor a man like Fox. And as time went on, and his respect and admiration for the older man warmed to deep affection, he realized that Fox had become for him much more than editor and friend. Little by little it seemed to George that he had found in Fox the father he had lost and had long been looking for. And so it was that Fox became a second father to him--the father of his spirit.",1
3142,"3. The Microscopic Gentleman from Japan In the old house where George lived that year Mr. Katamoto occupied the ground floor just below him, and in a little while they got to know each other very well. It might be said that their friendship began in mystification and went on to a state of security and staunch understanding.",1
3143,"Not that Mr. Katamoto ever forgave George when he erred. He was always instantly ready to inform him that he had taken a false step again (the word is used advisedly), but he was so infinitely patient, so unflaggingly hopeful of George's improvement, so unfailingly good-natured and courteous, that no one could possibly have been angry or failed to try to mend his ways. What saved the situation was Katamoto's gleeful, childlike sense of humour. He was one of those microscopic gentlemen from Japan, scarcely five feet tall, thin and very wiry in his build, and George's barrel chest, broad shoulders, long, dangling arms, and large feet seemed to inspire his comic risibilities from the beginning. The first time they met, as they were just passing each other in the hall, Katamoto began to giggle when he saw George coming; and as they came abreast, the little man flashed a great expanse of gleaming teeth, wagged a finger roguishly, and said:  ""Tramp-ling!",1
3144,"Tramp-ling! For several days, whenever they passed each other in the hall, this same performance was repeated. George thought the words were very mysterious, and at first could not fathom their recondite meaning or understand why the sound of them was enough to set Katamoto off in a paroxysm of mirth. And yet when he would utter them and George would look at him in a surprised, inquiring kind of way, Katamoto would bend double with convulsive laughter and would stamp at the floor like a child with a tiny foot, shrieking hysterically! Yis--yis--yis! You are tramp-ling!""--after which he would flee away.",1
3145,"George inferred that these mysterious references to ""tramp-ling"" which always set Katamoto off in such a fit of laughter had something to do with the bigness of his feet, for Katamoto would look at them quickly and slyly as he passed, and then giggle. However, a fuller explanation was soon provided. Katamoto came upstairs one afternoon and knocked at George's door. When it was opened, he giggled and flashed his teeth and looked somewhat embarrassed.. After a moment, with evident hesitancy, he grinned painfully and said:  ""If you ple-e-eze, sir!",1
3146,"Will you--have some tea--with me--yis? He spoke the words very slowly, with a deliberate formality, after which he flashed a quick, eager, and ingratiating smile. George told him he would be glad to, and got his coat and started downstairs with him. Katamoto padded swiftly on ahead, his little feet shod in felt slippers that made no sound. Half-way down the stairs, as if the noise of George's heavy tread had touched his funny-bone again, Katamoto stopped quickly, turned and pointed at George's feet, and giggled coyly: ""Tramp-ling! You are trampling! Then he turned and fairly fled away down the stairs and down the hall, shrieking like a gleeful child. He waited at the door to usher his guest in, introduced him to the slender, agile little Japanese girl who seemed to stay there all the time, and finally brought George back into his studio and served him tea.",1
3147,"It was an amazing place. Katamoto bad redecorated the fine old rooms and fitted them up according to the whims of his curious taste. The big back room was very crowded, intricate, and partitioned off into several small compartments with beautiful Japanese screens. He had also constructed a flight of stairs and a balcony that extended around three sides of the room, and on this balcony George could see a couch. The room was crowded with tiny chairs and tables, and there was an opulent-looking sofa and cushions. There were a great many small carved objects and bric-à-brac, and a strong smell of incense.",1
3148,"The centre of the room, however, had been left entirely bare save for a big strip of spattered canvas and an enormous plaster figure. George gathered that he did a thriving business turning out sculptures for expensive speak-easies, or immense fifteen-foot statues of native politicians which were to decorate public squares in little towns, or in the state capitals of Arkansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and Wyoming. Where and how he had learned this curious profession George never found out, but he had mastered it with true Japanese fidelity, and so well that his products were apparently in greater demand than those of American sculptors. In spite of his small size and fragile build, the man was a dynamo of energy and could perform the labours of a Titan. God knows how he did it--where he found the strength.",1
3149,"George asked a question about the big plaster cast in the centre of the room, and Katamoto took him over and showed it to him, remarking as he pointed to the creature's huge feet:  ""He is--like you!... He is tramp-ling!...Yis!... He is tramp-ling!",1
3150,"Then he took George up the stairs on to the balcony, which George dutifully admired. Yis?--You like? He smiled at George eagerly, a little doubtfully, then pointed at his couch and said: ""I sleep here! Then he pointed to the ceiling, which was so low that George had to stoop. You sleep there?"" said Katamoto eagerly.",1
3151,"George nodded. Katamoto went on again with a quick smile, but with embarrassed hesitancy and a painful difficulty in his tone that had not been there before: I here,"" he said, pointing, ""you there--yis?""  He looked at George almost pleadingly, a little desperately--and suddenly George began to catch on.",1
3152,"Oh! You mean I am right above you--  Katamoto nodded with instant relief--""and sometimes when I stay up late you hear me?""  ""Yis! Yis!",1
3153,"He kept nodding his head vigorously. Sometimes--"" he smiled a little painfully--""sometimes--you will be tramp-ling! He shook his finger at George with coy reproof and giggled.",1
3154,"I'm awfully sorry,"" George said. Of course, I didn't know you slept so near--so near the ceiling. When I work late I pace the floor. It's a bad habit. I'll do what I can to stop it. Oh, no-o!"" he cried, genuinely distressed.",1
3155,"I not want--how you say it?--change your life!...If you ple-e-ese, sir! Just little thing--not wear shoes at night! He pointed at his own small felt-shod feet and smiled up at George hopefully. You like slippers yis? And he smiled persuasively again.",1
3156,"After that, of course, George wore slippers. But sometimes he would forget, and the next morning Katamoto would be rapping at his door again. He was never angry, he was always patient and good-humoured, he was always beautifully courteous--but he would always call George to account. You were tramp-ling! he would cry. Last night--again--tramp-ling! And George would tell him he was sorry and would try not to do it again, and Katamoto would go away giggling, pausing to turn and wag his finger roguishly and call out once more, ""Tramp-ling!""--after which he would flee downstairs, shrieking with laughter.",1
3157,"They were good friends. In the months that followed, again and again George would come in the house to find the hall below full of sweating, panting movers, over whom Katamoto, covered from head to foot with clots and lumps of plaster, would hover prayerfully and with a fearful, pleading grin lest they mar his work, twisting his small hands together convulsively, aiding the work along by slight shudders, quick darts of breathless terror, writhing and shrinking movements of the body, and saying all the while with an elaborate, strained, and beseeching courtesy: Now, if--you--gentleman--a little!...You...yis--yis--yis-s!"" with a convulsive grin. Oh-h-h! Yis--yis-s! If you ple-e-ese, sir!...If you would down--a little--yis-s!--yis-s!--yis-s! he hissed softly with that prayerful and pleading grin.",1
3158,"And the movers would carry out of the house and stow into their van the enormous piecemeal fragments of some North Dakota Pericles, whose size was so great that one wondered how this dapper, fragile little man could possibly have fashioned such a leviathan. Then the movers would depart, and for a space Mr. Katamoto would loaf and invite his soul. He would come out in the backyard with his girl, the slender, agile little Japanese--who looked as, if she had some Italian blood in her as well--and for hours at a time they would play at handball. Mr. Katamoto would knock the ball up against the projecting brick wall of the house next door, and every time he scored a point he would scream with laughter, clapping his small hands together, bending over weakly and pressing his hand against his stomach, and staggering about with delight and merriment. Choking with laughter, he would cry out in a high, delirious voice as rapidly as he could:  ""Yis, yis, yis!",1
3159,"Yis, yis, yis! Yis, yis, yis!""  Then he would catch sight of George looking at him from the window, and this would set him off again, for he would wag his finger and fairly scream:  ""You were tramp-ling!...Yis, yis, yis!... Last night--again tramp-ling! This would reduce him to such a paroxysm of mirth that he would stagger across the court and lean against the wall, all caved in, holding his narrow stomach and shrieking faintly.",1
3160,"It was now the full height of steaming summer, and one day early in August George came home to find the movers in the house again. This time it was obvious that a work of more than usual magnitude was in transit. Mr. Katamoto, spattered with plaster, was of course hovering about in the hall, grinning nervously and fluttering prayerfully around the husky truckmen. As George came in, two of the men were backing slowly down the hall, carrying between them an immense head, monstrously jowled and set in an expression of farseeing statesmanship. A moment later three more men backed out of the studio, panting and cursing as they grunted painfully around the flowing fragment of a long frock coat and the vested splendour of a bulging belly. The first pair had now gone back in the studio, and when they came out again they were staggering beneath the trousered shank of a mighty leg and a booted Atlantean hoof, and as they passed, one of the other men, now returning for more of the statesman's parts, pressed himself against the wall to let them by and said:  ""Jesus!",1
3161,"If the son-of-a-bitch stepped on you with that foot, he wouldn't leave a grease spot, would he, Joe?""  The last piece of all was an immense fragment of the Solon's arm and fist, with one huge forefinger pointed upwards in an attitude of solemn objurgation and avowal. That figure was Katamoto's masterpiece; and George felt as he saw it pass that the enormous upraised finger was the summit of his art and the consummation of his life: Certainly it was the apple of his eye. George had never seen him before in such a state of extreme agitation. He fairly prayed above the sweating men: It was obvious that the coarse indelicacy of their touch made him shudder. The grin was frozen on his face in an expression of congealed terror. He writhed, he wriggled, he wrung his little hands, he crooned to them. And if anything had happened to that fat, pointed finger, George felt sure that he would have dropped dead on the spot.",1
3162,"At length, however, they got everything stowed away in their big van without mishap and drove off with their Ozymandias, leaving Mr. Katamoto, frail, haggard, and utterly exhausted, looking at the kerb. He came back into the house and saw George standing there and smiled wanly at him. Tramp-ling,"" he said feebly, and shook his finger, and for the first time there was no mirth or energy in him.",1
3163,"George had never seen him tired before. It had never occurred to him that he could get tired. The little man had always been so full of inexhaustible life. And now, somehow, George felt an unaccountable sadness to see him so weary and so strangely grey. Katamoto was silent for a moment, and then he lifted his face and said, almost tonelessly, yet with a shade of wistful eagerness:  ""You see statue--yis?""  ""Yes, Kato, I saw it.",1
3164,"And you like?""  ""Yes, very much. And--"" he giggled a little and made a shaking movement with his hands--""you see foot? Yes.""  ""I sink,"" he said, ""he will be tramp-ling--yis?""--and he made laughing sound.",1
3165,"He ought to,"" George said, ""with a hoof like that. It's almost as big as mine,"" he added, as an afterthought. Katamoto seemed delighted with this observation, for he laughed shrilly and said: ""Yis! Yis!""--nodding his head emphatically. He was silent for another moment, then hesitantly, but with an eagerness that he could not conceal, he said:",1
3166,"And you see finger?""  ""Yes, Kato. And you like?""--quickly, earnestly.  ""Very much.""  ""Big finger--yis?""--with a note of rising triumph in his ""Very big, Kato.""  ""And pointing--yis?"" he said ecstatically, grinning from ear to ear and pointing his own small finger heavenward. Yes, pointing. He sighed contentedly.",1
3167,"Well, zen,"" he said, with the appeased' air of a child, ""I'm glad you like. For a week or so after that George did not see Katamoto again or even think of him. This was the vacation period at the School for Utility Cultures, and George was devoting every minute of his time, day and, night, to a fury of new writing. Then one afternoon; a long passage completed and the almost illegible pages of his swift scrawl tossed in a careless heap upon the floor, he sat relaxed, looking out of his back window, and suddenly he thought of Katamoto again. He remembered that he had not seen him recently, and it seemed strange that he had not even heard the familiar thud of the little ball against the wall outside or the sound of his high, shrill laughter. This realisation, with its sense of loss, so troubled him that he went downstairs immediately and pressed Katamoto's bell.",1
3168,"There was no answer. All was silent. He waited, and no one came. Then he went down to the basement and found the janitor and spoke to him. He said that Mr. Katamoto had been ill, No, it was not serious, he thought, but the doctor had advised a rest, a brief period of relaxation from his exhausting labours, and had sent him for care and observation to the near-by hospital.",1
3169,"George meant to go to see him, but he was busy with his writing and kept putting it off. Then one morning, some ten days later, coming back home after breakfast in a restaurant, he found a moving van backed up before the house. Katamoto's door was open, and when he looked inside the moving people had already stripped the apartment almost bare. In the centre of the once fantastic room, now empty, where Katamoto had performed his prodigies of work, stood a young Japanese, an acquaintance of the sculptor, whom George had seen there several times before. He was supervising the removal of the last furnishings.",1
3170,"The young Japanese looked up quickly, politely, with a toothy grin of frozen courtesy as George came in. He did not speak until George asked him how Mr. Katamoto was. And then, with the same toothy, frozen grin upon his face, the same impenetrable courtesy, he said that Mr. Katamoto was dead.",1
3171,"George was shocked, and stood there for a moment, knowing there was nothing more to say, and yet feeling somehow, as people always feel on these occasions, that there was something that, he ought to say. He looked at the young Japanese and started to speak, and found himself looking into the inscrutable, polite, untelling eyes of Asia. So he said nothing more. He just thanked the young man and went out.",1
3172,"4. Some Things Will Never Change Out of his front windows George could see nothing except the sombre bulk of the warehouse across the street. It was an old building, with a bleak and ugly front of rusty, indurated brown and a harsh webbing of fire-escapes, and across the whole width of the facade stretched a battered wooden sign on which, in faded letters, one could make out the name--""The Security Distributing Corp."" George did not know what a distributing corporation was, but every day since he had come into this street to live, enormous motor-vans had driven up before this dingy building and had backed snugly against the worn plankings of the loading platform, which ended with a sharp, sheared emptiness four feet above the pavement. The drivers and their helpers would leap from their seats, and instantly the quiet depths of the old building would burst into a furious energy of work, and the air would be filled with harsh cries:",1
3173,"Back it up, deh! Back it up! Cuh-mahn! Cuh-mahn! Givvus a hand, youse guys! Hey-y! You!""  They looked at one another with hard faces of smiling derision, quietly saying ""Jesus!",1
3174,"out of the corners of their mouths. Surly, they stood upon their rights, defending truculently the narrow frontier of their duty:  ""Wadda I care where it goes! Dat's yoeh look-out! Wat t'hell's it got to do wit me?""  They worked with speed and power and splendid aptness, furiously, unamiably, with high, exacerbated voices, spurred and goaded by their harsh unrest.",1
3175,"The city was their stony-hearted mother, and from her breast they had drawn a bitter nurture. Born to brick and asphalt, to crowded tenements and swarming streets, stunned into sleep as children beneath the sudden slamming racket of the elevated trains, taught to fight, to menace, and to struggle in a world of savage violence and incessant din, they had had the city's qualities stamped into their flesh and movements, distilled through all their tissues, etched with the city's acid into their tongue and brain and vision. Their faces were tough and seamed, the skin thick, dry, without a hue of freshness or of colour. Their pulse beat with the furious rhythm of the city's stroke: ready in an instant with a curse, metallic clangours sounded from their twisted lips, and their hearts were filled with a dark, immense, and secret pride.",1
3176,"Their souls were like the asphalt visages of city streets. Each day the violent colours of a thousand new sensations swept across them, and each day all sound and sight and fury were erased from their unyielding surfaces. Ten thousand furious days had passed about them, and they had no memory. They lived like creatures born full-grown into present time, shedding the whole accumulation of the past with every breath, and all their lives were written in the passing of each actual moment.",1
3177,"And they were sure and certain, for ever wrong, but always confident. They had no hesitation, they confessed no ignorance or error, and they knew no doubts. They began each morning with a gibe, a shout, an oath of hard impatience, eager for the tumult of the day. At noon they sat strongly in their seats and, through fumes of oil and hot machinery, addressed their curses to the public at the tricks and strategies of cunning rivals, the tyranny of the police, the stupidity of pedestrians, and the errors of less skilful men than they. Each day they faced the perils of the streets with hearts as calm as if they were alone upon a country road. Each day, with minds untroubled, they embarked upon adventures from which the bravest men bred in the wilderness would have recoiled in terror and desolation.",1
3178,"In the raw days of early spring they had worn shirts of thick black wool and leather jackets, but now, in summer, their arms were naked, tattooed, brown, and lean with the play of whipcord muscles. The power and precision with which they worked stirred in George a deep emotion of respect, and also touched him with humility. For whenever he saw it, his own life, with its conflicting desires, its uncertain projects and designs, its labours begun in hope and so often ended in incompletion, by comparison with the lives of these men who, had learned to use their strength and talents perfectly, seemed faltering, blind, and baffled.",1
3179,"At night, too, five times a week, the mighty vans would line up at the kerb in an immense and waiting caravan. They were covered now with great tarpaulins, small green lamps were burning on each side, and the drivers, their faces faintly lit with the glowing points of cigarettes, would be talking quietly in the shadows of their huge machines. Once George had asked one of the drivers the destination of these nightly journeys, and the man had told him that they went to Philadelphia, and would return again by morning.",1
3180,"The sight of these great vans at night, sombre, silent, yet alive with powerful expectancy as their drivers waited for the word to start, gave George a sense of mystery and joy. These men were part of that great company who love the night, and he felt a bond of union with them. For he had always loved the night more dearly than the day, and the energies of his life had risen to their greatest strength in the secret and exultant heart of darkness.",1
3181,"He knew the joys and labours of such men as these. He could see the shadowy procession of their vans lumbering through the sleeping towns, and feel the darkness, the cool fragrance of the country, on his face. He could see the drivers hunched behind the wheels, their senses all alert in the lilac dark, their eyes fixed hard upon the road to curtain off the loneliness of the land at night. And he knew the places where they stopped to eat, the little all-night lunch-rooms warm with greasy light, now empty save for the dozing authority of the aproned Greek behind the counter, and now filled with the heavy shuffle of the drivers' feet, the hard and casual intrusions of their voices.",1
3182,"They came in, flung themselves upon the row of stools, and gave their orders. And as they waited, their hunger drawn into sharp focus by the male smells of boiling coffee, frying eggs and onions, and sizzling hamburgers, they took the pungent, priceless, and uncostly solace of a cigarette, lit between cupped hand and strong-seamed mouth, drawn deep and then exhaled in slow fumes from the nostrils. They poured great gobs and gluts of thick tomato ketchup on their hamburgers, tore with blackened fingers at the slabs of fragrant bread, and ate with jungle lust, thrusting at plate and cup with quick and savage gulpings.",1
3183,"Oh, he was with them, of them, for them, blood brother of their joy and hunger to the last hard swallow, the last deep, ease of sated bellies, the last slow coil of blue expiring from their grateful lungs. Their lives seemed glorious to him in the magic dark of summer. They swept cleanly through the night into the first light and bird song of the morning, into the morning of new joy upon the earth; and as he thought of this it seemed to him that the secret, wild, and lonely heart of man was young and living in the darkness, and could never die.",1
3184,"Before him, all that summer of 1929, in the broad window of the warehouse, a man sat at a desk and looked out into the street, in a posture that never changed. George saw him there whenever he glanced across, yet he never saw him do anything but look out of the window with a fixed, abstracted stare. At first the man had been such an unobtrusive part of his surroundings that he had seemed to fade into' them, and had gone almost unnoticed. Then Esther, having observed him there, pointed to him one day and said merrily:  ""There's our friend in the Distributing Corp again!",1
3185,"What do you suppose he distributes? I've never seen him do anything! Have you noticed him--hah?"" she cried eagerly. God! It's the strangest thing I ever saw! She laughed richly, made a shrug of bewildered protest, and, after a moment, said with serious wonder: ""Isn't it queer? What do you suppose a man like that can do? What do you suppose he's thinking of?""  ""Oh, I don't know,"" George said indifferently.",1
3186,"Of nothing, I suppose. Then they forgot the man and turned to talk of other things, yet from that moment the man's singular presence was pricked out in George's mind and he began to watch him with hypnotic fascination, puzzled by the mystery of his immobility and his stare. And after that, as soon as Esther came in every day, she would glance across the street and cry out in a jolly voice which had in it the note of affectionate satisfaction and assurance that people have when they see some familiar and expected object:  ""Well, I see our old friend, The Distributing Corp, is still looking out of his window!",1
3187,"I wonder what he's thinking of to-day. She would turn away, laughing. Then, for a moment, with her childlike fascination for words and rhythms, she gravely meditated their strange beat, silently framing and pronouncing with her lips a series of meaningless sounds--""Corp-Borp-Forp-Dorp-Torp""--and at length singing out in a gleeful chant, and with an air of triumphant discovery:  ""The Distributing Corp, the Distributing Corp, He sits all day and he does no Worp!",1
3188,"George protested that her rhyme made no sense, but she threw back her encrimsoned face and screamed with laughter. But after a while they stopped laughing about the man. For, obscure as his employment seemed, incredible and comical as his indolence had been when they first noticed it, there came to be something impressive, immense, and formidable in the quality of that fixed stare. Day by day, a thronging traffic of life and business passed before him in the street; day by day, the great vans came, the drivers, handlers, and packers swarmed before his eyes, filling, the air with their oaths and cries, irritably intent upon their labour but the man in the window never looked at them, never gave any, sign that he heard them, never seemed to be aware of their existence--he just sat there and looked out, his eyes fixed in an abstracted stare.",1
3189,"In the course of George Webber's life, many things of no great importance in themselves had become deeply embedded in his memory, stuck there like burs in a scottie's tail; and always they were little things which, in an instant of clear perception, had riven his heart with some poignant flash of meaning. Thus he remembered, and would remember for ever, the sight of Esther's radiant, earnest face when, unexpectedly one night, he caught sight of it as it flamed and 'vanished in a crowd of grey, faceless faces in Times Square. So, too, he remembered two deaf mutes he had seen talking on their fingers in a subway train; and a ringing peal of children's laughter in a desolate street at sunset; and the waitresses in their dingy little rooms across the backyard, washing, ironing, and rewashing day after day the few adornments of their shabby finery, in endless preparations for a visitor who never came.",1
3190,"And now, to his store of treasured trivia was added the memory of this man's face--thick, white, expressionless, set in its stolid and sorrowful stare. Immutable, calm, impassive, it became for him the symbol of a kind of permanence in the rush and sweep of chaos in the city, where all things come and go and pass and are so soon forgotten. For, day after day, as he watched the man and tried to penetrate his mystery, at last it seemed to him that he had found the answer.",1
3191,"And after that, in later years, whenever he remembered the man's face, the time was fixed at the end of a day in late summer. Without-violence or heat, the last rays of the sun fell on the warm brick of the building and painted it with a sad, unearthly light. In the window the man sat, always looking out. He never wavered in his gaze, his eyes were calm and sorrowful, and on his face was legible the exile of an imprisoned spirit.",1
3192,"That man's face became for him the face of. Darkness and of Time. It never spoke, and yet it had a voice--a voice that seemed to have the whole earth in it. It was the voice of evening and of night, and in it were the blended tongues of all those men who have passed through the heat and fury of the day, and who now lean quietly upon the sills of evening. In it was the whole vast hush and weariness that comes upon the city at the hour of dusk, when the chaos of another day is ended, and when everything--streets, buildings, and eight million people--breathe slowly, with a tired and sorrowful joy. And in that single tongueless voice was the knowledge of all their tongues.",1
3193,"Child, child,"" it said, ""have patience and belief, for life is many days, and each present hour will pass away. Son, son, you have been mad and drunken, furious and wild, filled with hatred and despair, and all the dark confusions of the soul--but so have we. You found the earth too great for your one life, you found your brain and sinew smaller than the hunger and desire that fed on them--but it has been this way with all men. You have stumbled on in darkness, you have been pulled in opposite directions, you have faltered, you have missed the way--but, child, this is the chronicle of the earth. And now, because you have known madness and despair, and because you will grow desperate again before you come to evening, we who have stormed the ramparts of the furious earth and been hurled back, we who have been maddened by the unknowable and bitter mystery of love, we who have hungered after fame and savoured all of life, the tumult, pain, and frenzy, and now sit quietly by our windows watching all that henceforth never more shall touch us--we call upon you to take heart, for we can swear to you that these things pass.",1
3194,"We have outlived the shift and glitter of so many fashions, we have seen so many things that come and go, so many words forgotten, so many flames that flared and were destroyed; yet we know now we are strangers whose footfalls have not left a print upon the endless streets of life. We shall not go into the dark again, nor suffer madness, nor admit despair: we have built a wall about us now. We shall not hear the docks of time strike out on foreign air, nor wake at morning in some alien land to think of home: our wandering is over, and our hunger fed. 0 brother, son, and comrade, because we have lived so long and seen so much , we are content to make our own a few things now, letting millions pass.",1
3195,"Some things will never change. Some things will always be the same. Lean down your ear upon the earth, and listen.",1
3196,"The voice of forest water in the night, a woman's laughter in the dark, the clean, hard rattle of raked gravel, the cricketing stitch of midday in hot meadows, the delicate web of children's voices in bright air--these things will never change. The glitter of sunlight on roughened water, the glory of the stars, the innocence of morning, the smell of the sea in harbours, the feathery blur and smoky buddings of young boughs, and something there that comes and goes and never can be captured, the thorn of spring, the sharp and tongueless cry--these things will always be the same. All things belonging to the earth will never change--the leaf, the blade, the flower, the wind that cries and sleeps and wakes again, the trees whose stiff arms clash and tremble in the dark, and the dust of lovers long since buried in the earth--all things proceeding from the earth to seasons, all things that lapse and change and come again upon the earth--these things will always be the same, for they come up from the earth that never changes, they go back into the earth that lasts for ever. Only the earth endures, but it endures for ever.",1
3197,"The tarantula, the adder, and the asp will also never change. Pain and death will always be the same. But under the pavements trembling like a pulse, under the buildings trembling like a cry, under the waste of time, under the hoof of the beast above the broken bones of cities, there will be something growing like a flower, something bursting from the earth again, for ever deathless, faithful, coming into life again like April. 5.",1
3198,"The Hidden Terror Hand looked at the yellow envelope curiously and turned it over and over in his hand. It gave him a feeling of uneasiness and suppressed excitement to see his name through the transparent front. He was not used to receiving telegrams. Instinctively he delayed opening it because he dreaded what it might contain. Some forgotten incident in his childhood made him associate telegrams with bad news. Who could have sent it? And what could it be about? Well, open it, you fool, and find out!",1
3199,"He ripped off the flap and took out the message. He read it quickly, first glancing at the signature. It was from his Uncle Mark Joyner:  ""YOUR AUNT MAW DIED LAST NIGHT STOP FUNERAL THURSDAY IN LIBYA HILL STOP COME HOME IF YOU CAN.",1
3200,"That was all. No explanation of what she had died of. Old age, most likely. Nothing else could have killed her. She hadn't been sick or' they would have let him know before this.",1
3201,"The news shook him profoundly. But it was not grief he felt so much as a deep sense of loss, almost impersonal in its quality--a sense of loss and unbelief such as one might feel to discover suddenly that some great force 'in nature had ceased to operate. He couldn't take it in. Ever since his mother had died when he was only eight years old, Aunt Maw had been the most solid and permanent fixture in his boy's universe. She was a spinster, the older sister of his mother and of his Uncle Mark, and she had taken charge of him and brought him up with all the inflexible zeal of her puritanical nature. She had done her best to make a Joyner of him and a credit to the narrow, provincial, mountain clan to which she belonged.-In this she had failed, and his defection from the ways of Joyner righteousness had caused her deep pain. He had known this for a long time; but now he realised, too, more clearly than he had, ever done before, that she had never faltered in her duty to him as she saw it. As he thought about her life the felt an inexpressible pity for her, and a surge of tenderness and affection almost choked him.",1
3202,"As far back as he could remember, Aunt Maw had seemed to him an ageless crone, as old as God. He could still hear her voice--that croaking monotone which had gone on and on in endless stories of her past, peopling his childhood world with the whole host of Joyners dead and buried in the hills of Zebulon in ancient days before the Civil War. And almost every tale she had told him was a chronicle of sickness, death, and sorrow. She had known about all the Joyners for the last hundred years, and whether they had died of consumption, typhoid fever, pneumonia, meningitis, or pellagra, and she had relived each incident in their lives with an air of croaking relish. From her he had got a picture of his mountain kinsmen that was constantly dark with the terrors of misery and sudden death, a picture made ghostly at frequent intervals by supernatural revelations. The Joyners, so she thought, had been endowed with occult powers by the Almighty, and weft for ever popping up on country roads and speaking to people as they passed, only to have it turn out later that they had been fifty miles away at the time. They were for ever hearing voices and receiving premonitions. If a neighbour died suddenly, the Joyners would flock from miles around 'to sit up with the corpse, and in the flickering light of pine logs on the hearth they would talk unceasingly through the night, their droning voices punctuated by the crumbling of the ash as they told how they had received intimations of the impending death a week before it happened.",1
3203,"This was the image of the Joyner world which Aunt Maw's tireless memories had built up in the mind and spirit of the boy. And he had felt somehow that although other men would live their day and die, the Joyners were a race apart, not subject to this law. They fed on death and were triumphant over it, and the Joyners would go on for ever. But now Aunt Maw the oldest and most death-triumphant Joyner of them all, was dead...",1
3204,"The funeral was to be on Thursday. This was Tuesday. If he took the train to-day, he would arrive to-morrow. He knew that all the Joyners from the hills of Zebulon County in Old Catawba would be gathering even now to hold their tribal rites of death and sorrow, and if he got there so soon he would not be able to escape the horror of their brooding talk. It would be better to wait a day and turn up just before the funeral.",1
3205,"It was now early September. The new term at the School for Utility Cultures would not begin until after the middle of the month, George had not been back to Libya Hill in several years, and he thought he might remain a week or so to see the town again. But he dreaded the prospect of staying with his Joyner relatives, especially at a time like this. Then he remembered Randy Shepperton, who lived next door. Mr. and Mrs. Shepperton were both dead now, and the older girl had married and moved away. Randy had a good job in the town and lived on in the family place with his sister Margaret, who kept house for him. Perhaps they could put him up. They would understand his feelings. So he sent a telegram to Randy, asking for his hospitality, and telling what train he would arrive on.",1
3206,"By the next afternoon, when George went to Pennsylvania Station to catch his train, he had recovered from the first shock of Aunt Maw's death. The human mind is a fearful instrument of adaptation, and in nothing is this more clearly shown than in its mysterious powers of resilience, self-protection, and self-healing. Unless an event completely shatters the order of one's life, the mind, if it has youth and health and time enough, accepts the inevitable and gets itself ready for the next happening like a grimly dutiful American tourist who, on arriving at a new town, looks around him, takes his bearings, and says, ""Well, where do I go from here? So it was with George. The prospect of the funeral filled him with dread, but that was still a day off; meanwhile he had a long train ride ahead of him, and he pushed his sombre feelings into the background and allowed himself to savour freely the eager excitement which any journey by train always gave him.",1
3207,"The station, as he entered it, was murmurous with the immense and distant sound of time. Great slant beams of mottled light fell ponderously athwart the station's floor, and the calm voice of time hovered along the walls and ceiling of that mighty room, distilled out of the voices and movements of the people who swarmed beneath. It had the murmur of a distant sea, the languorous lapse and flow of waters on a beach. It was elemental, detached, indifferent to the lives of men. They contributed to it as drops of rain contribute to a river that draws its flood and movement majestically from great depths, out of purple hills at evening.",1
3208,"Few buildings are vast enough to hold the sound of time, and now it seemed to George that there was a superb fitness in the fact that the one which held it better than all others should be a railway station. For here, as nowhere else on earth, men were brought together for a moment at the beginning or end of their innumerable journeys, here one saw their greetings and farewells, here, in a single instant, one got the entire picture of the human destiny. Men came and went, they passed and vanished, and all were moving through the moments of their lives to death, all made small tickings in the sound of time--but the voice of time remained aloof and unperturbed, a drowsy and eternal murmur below the immense and distant roof.",1
3209,"Each man and woman was full of his own journey. He had one way to go, one end to reach, through all the shifting complexities of the crowd. For each it was his journey, and he cared nothing about the journeys of the others. Here, as George waited, was a traveller who was afraid that he would miss his train. He was excited, his movements were feverish and abrupt, he shouted to his porter, he went to the window to buy his ticket, he had to wait in line, he fairly pranced with nervousness and kept looking at the clock. Then his wife came quickly towards him over the polished floor. When she was still some distance off, she shouted:  ""Have you got the tickets?",1
3210,"We haven't much time! We'll miss the train!""  ""Don't I know it? he shouted back in an annoyed tone. I'm doing the best I can!""' Then he added bitterly and loudly: ""We may make it if this man in front of me ever gets done buying his ticket!",1
3211,"The man in front turned on him menacingly. Now wait a minute, wait a minute! he said. You're not the only one who has to make a train, you know! I was here before you were! You'll have to wait your turn like everybody else!",1
3212,"A quarrel now developed between them. The other travellers who were waiting for their tickets grew angry and began to mutter. The ticket agent drummed impatiently on his window and peered out at them with a sour visage. Finally some young tough down the line called out in tones of whining irritation:  ""Aw, take it outside f' Chris' sake!",1
3213,"Give the rest of us a chance! You guys are holdin' up the line! At last the man got his tickets and rushed towards his porter, hot and excited. The negro waited suave and smiling, full of easy reassurance:  ""You folks don't need to hurry now.",1
3214,You got lotsa time to make that train. It ain't goin' away without you. Who were these travellers for whom time lay coiled in delicate twists of blue steel wire in each man's pocket?,1
3215,"Here were a few of them: a homesick nigger going back to Georgia; a rich young man from an estate on the Hudson who was going to visit his mother in Washington; a district superintendent, and three of his agents, of a farm machinery company, who had been attending a convention of district leaders in the city; the president of a bank in an Old Catawba town which was tottering on the edge of ruin, who had come desperately, accompanied by two local politicians, to petition New York bankers for a loan; a Greek with tan shoes, a cardboard valise; a swarthy face, and eyes glittering with mistrust, who had peered in through the ticket seller's window, saying: ""How mucha you want to go to Pittsburgh, eh?""; an effeminate young man from one of the city universities who was going to make his weekly lecture on the arts of the theatre to a club of ladies in Trenton, New Jersey; a lady poetess from a town in Indiana who had been to New York for her yearly spree of ""bohemianism""; a prize-fighter and his manager on their way to a fight in St. Louis; some Princeton boys just back from a summer in Europe, on their way home for a short visit before returning to college; a private soldier in the United States army, with the cheap, tough, and slovenly appearance of a private soldier in the United States army; the president of a state university in the Middle West who had just made an eloquent appeal for funds to the New York alumni; a young married couple from Mississippi, with everything new--new clothes, new baggage--and a shy, hostile, and bewildered look; two little Filipinos, brown as berries and with the delicate bones of birds, dressed with the foppish perfection of manikins; women from the suburban towns of New Jersey who had come to the city to shop; women and girls from small towns in the South and West, who had come for holidays, sprees, or visits; the managers and agents of clothing stores in little towns all over the country who had come to the city to buy new styles and fashions; New Yorkers of a certain class, flashily dressed, sensual, and with a high, hard finish, knowing and assured, on their way to vacations in Atlantic City; jaded, faded, bedraggled women, scolding and jerking viciously at the puny arms of dirty children; swarthy, scowling, and dominant-looking Italian men with their dark, greasy, and flabby-looking women, sullen but submissive both to lust and beatings; and smartly-dressed American women, obedient to neither bed nor whip, who had assertive, harsh voices, bold glances, and the good figures but not the living curves, either of body or of spirit, of love, lust, tenderness, or any female fullness of the earth whatever. There were all sorts and conditions of men and travellers: poor people with the hard, sterile faces of all New Jerseys of the flesh and spirit; shabby and beaten-looking devils with cheap suitcases containing a tie, a collar, and a shirt, who had a look of having dropped for ever off of passing trains into the dirty cinders of new towns and the hope of some new fortune; the shabby floaters and drifters of the nation; suave, wealthy, and experienced people who had been too far, too often, on too many costly trains and ships, and who never looked out of windows any more; old men and women from the country on first visits to their children in the city, who looked about them constantly and suspiciously with the quick eyes of birds and animals, alert, mistrustful, and afraid. There were people who saw everything, and people who saw nothing; people who were weary, sullen, sour, and people who laughed, shouted, and were exultant with the thrill of the voyage; people who thrust and jostled, and people who stood quietly and watched and waited; people with amused, superior looks, and people who glared and bristled pugnaciously. Young, old, rich, poor, Jews, Gentiles, Negroes, Italians, Greeks, Americans--they were all there in the station, their infinitely varied destinies suddenly harmonised and given a moment of intense and sombre meaning as they were gathered into the murmurous, all-taking unity of time.",1
3216,"George had a berth in car K19. It was not really different in any respect from any other pullman car, yet for George it had a very special quality and meaning. For every day K19 bound together two points upon the continent--the great city and the small town of Libya Hill where he had been born, eight hundred miles away. It left New York at one-thirty-five each afternoon, and it arrived in Libya Hill at eleven-twenty the next morning.",1
3217,"The moment he entered the pullman he was transported instantly from the vast allness of general humanity in the station into the familiar geography of his home town. One might have been away for years and never have seen 'an old familiar face; one might have wandered to the far ends of the earth; one might have got with child a mandrake root, or heard mermaids singing, or known the words and music of what songs the Sirens sang; one might have lived and worked alone for ages in the canyons of Manhattan until the very memory of home was lost and far as in a dream: yet the moment that he entered K19 it all came back again, his feet touched earth, and he was home. It was uncanny. And what was most wonderful and mysterious about it was that one could come here to this appointed meeting each day at thirty-five minutes after one o'clock, one could come here through the humming traffic of the city to the gigantic portals of the mighty station, one could walk through the concourse for ever swarming with its bustle of arrival and departure, one could traverse the great expanses of the station, peopled with Everybody and haunted by the voice of time--and then, down those steep stairs, there in the tunnel's depth, underneath this hive-like universe of life, waiting in its proper place, no whit different outwardly from all its other grimy brethren, was K19.",1
3218,"The beaming porter took his bag with a cheerful greeting: ""Yes, suh, Mistah Webbah! Glad to see you, suh! Comin' down to see de folks?",1
3219,"And as they made their way down the green aisle to his seat, George told him that he was going home to his aunt's funeral. Instantly the negro's smile was blotted out, and his face took on an expression of deep solemnity and respect. I'se sorry to hear dat, Mistah Webbah,"" he said, shaking his head. Yes, suh, I'se pow'ful sorry to hear you say dat. Even before these words, were out of mind, another voice from the seat behind was raised in greeting, and George did not have to turn to know who it was.",1
3220,"It was Sol Isaacs, of The Toggery, and George knew that he had been up to the city on a buying trip, a pilgrimage that he made four times a year. Somehow the knowledge of this commercial punctuality warmed the young man's heart, as did the friendly beak-nosed face, the gaudy shirt, the bright neck-tie, and the dapper smartness of the light grey suit--for Sol was what is known as ""a snappy dresser"". George looked around him now to see if there were any others that he knew. Yes, there was the tall, spare, brittle, sandy-complexioned figure of the banker, Jarvis Riggs, and on the seat opposite, engaged in conversation with him, were two other local dignitaries. He recognized the round-featured, weak amiability of the Mayor, Baxter Kennedy; and, sprawled beside him, his long, heavy shanks thrust out into the aisle, the bald crown of his head with its tonsured fringe of black hair thrown back against the top of the seat, his loose-jowled face hanging heavy as he talked, was the large, well-oiled beefiness of Pa on Flack, who manipulated the politics of Libya Hill and was called ""Parson"" because he never missed a prayer-meeting at the Campbellite Church. They were talking earnestly and loudly, and George could overhear fragments of their conversation:  ""Market Street--oh, give me Market Street any day!",1
3221,"Gay Rudd is asking two thousand a front foot for his. He'll get it, too. I wouldn't take a cent less than twenty-five, and I'm not selling anyway. You mark my word, she'll go to three before another year is out!",1
3222,And that's not Al! That's only the beginning! Could this be Libya Hill that they were talking about?,1
3223,"It didn't sound at all like the sleepy little mountain town he had known all his life. He rose from his seat and went over to the group. Why, hello, Webber! Hello, son! Parson Flack screwed up his face into something that was meant for an ingratiating smile and showed his big yellow teeth. Glad to see you. How are you, son?""  George shook hands all round and stood beside them a moment.",1
3224,"We heard you speaking to the porter when you came in,"" said the Mayor, with a look of solemn commiseration on his weak face. Sorry, son. We didn't know about it. We've been away a week. Happen suddenly?... Yes, yes, of course. Well, your aunt was pretty old. Got to expect that sort of thing at her time of life. She was a good woman, a good woman. Sorry, son, that such a sad occasion brings you home. There was a short silence after this, as if the others wished it understood that the Mayor had voiced their sentiments, too.",1
3225,"Then, this mark of respect to the dead being accomplished, Jarvis Riggs spoke up heartily:  ""You ought to stay around a while, Webber. You wouldn't know the town. Things are booming down our way. Why, only the other day Mack Judson paid three hundred thousand for the Draper Block. The building is a dump, of course--what he paid for was the land. That's five thousand a foot. Pretty good for Libya Hill, eh? The Reeves estate has bought up all the land on Parker Street below Parker Hill. They're going to build the whole thing up with business property. That's the way it is all over town. Within a few years Libya Hill is going to be the largest and most beautiful city in the state. You mark my words. Yes,"" agreed Parson Flack, nodding his head ponderously, knowingly, ""and I hear they've been trying to buy your uncle's property on South Main Street, there at the corner of the Square.",1
3226,A syndicate wants to tear down the hardware store and put up a big hotel. Your uncle wouldn't sell. He's smart. George returned to his seat feeling confused and bewildered.,1
3227,"He was going back home for the first time in several years, and he wanted to see the town as he remembered it. Evidently he would find it considerably changed. But what was this that was happening to it? He couldn't make it out. It disturbed him vaguely, as one is always disturbed and shaken by the sudden realisation of Time's changes in something that one has known all one's life.",1
3228,"The train had hurtled like a projectile through its tube beneath the Hudson River to emerge in the dazzling sunlight of a September afternoon, and now it was racing across the flat desolation of the Jersey meadows. George sat by the window and saw the smouldering dumps, the bogs, the blackened factories slide past, and felt that one of the most wonderful things in the world is the experience of being on a train. It is so different from watching a train go by. To anyone outside, a speeding train is a thunderbolt of driving rods, a hot hiss of steam, a blurred flash of coaches, a wall of movement and of noise, a shriek, a wail, and then just emptiness and absence, with a feeling of ""There goes everybody! without knowing who anybody is. And all of a sudden the watcher feels the vastness and loneliness of America, and the nothingness of all those little lives burled past upon the immensity of the continent. But if one is inside the train, everything is different. The train itself is a miracle of man's handiwork, and everything about it is eloquent of human purpose and direction. One feels the brakes go on when the train is coming to a river, and one knows that the old gloved hand of cunning is at the throttle. One's own sense of manhood and of mastery is heightened by being on a train. And all the other people, how real they are! One sees the fat black porter with his ivory teeth and the great swollen gland on the back of his neck, and one warms with friendship for him. One looks at all the pretty girls with a sharpened eye and an awakened pulse. One observes all the other passengers with lively interest, and feels that he has known them for ever. In the morning most of them will be gone out of his life; some will drop out silently at night through the dark, drugged snoring of the sleepers; but now all are caught upon the wing and held for a moment in the peculiar intimacy of this pullman-car which has become their common home for a night.",1
3229,"Two travelling salesmen have struck up a chance acquaintance in the smoking-room, entering immediately the vast confraternity of their trade, and in a moment they are laying out the continent as familiarly as if it were their own backyard. They tell about running into So-and-So in St. Paul last July, and----  ""Who do you suppose I met coming out of Brown's Hotel in Denver just a week ago? You don't mean it!",1
3230,"I haven't seen old Joe in years! And Jim Withers--they've transferred him to the Atlanta office!""  ""Going to New Orleans?""  ""No, I'll make it this trip. I was there in May. With such talk as this one grows instantly familiar.",1
3231,"One enters naturally into the lives of all these people, caught here for just a night and hurtled down together across the continent at sixty miles an hour, and one becomes a member of the whole huge family of the earth. Perhaps this is our strange and haunting paradox here in America--that we are fixed and certain only when we are in movement. At any rate, that is how it seemed to young George Webber, who was never so assured of his purpose as when he was going somewhere on a train. And he never had the sense of home so much as when he felt that he was going there. It was only when he got there that his homelessness began.",1
3232,"At the far end of the car a man stood up and started back down the aisle towards the washroom. He walked with a slight limp and leaned upon a cane, and with his free hand he held on to the backs of the seats to brace himself against the lurching of the train. As he came abreast of George, who sat there gazing out the window, the man stopped abruptly. A strong, good-natured voice, warm, easy, bantering, unafraid, unchanged--exactly as it was when it was fourteen years of age--broke like a flood of living light upon his consciousness:",1
3233,"Well I'll be dogged! Hi, there, Monkus! Where you goin'?""  At the sound of the old jesting nickname George looked up quickly.",1
3234,"It was Nebraska Crane. The square, freckled, sunburned visage had the same humorous friendliness it had always had, and the tar-black Cherokee eyes looked out with the same straight, deadly fearlessness. The big brown paw came out and they clasped each other firmly. And, instantly, it was like coming home to a strong and friendly place. In another moment they were seated together, talking with the familiarity of people whom no gulf of years and distance could alter or separate.",1
3235,"George had seen Nebraska Crane only once in all the years since he himself had first left Libya Hill and gone away to college. But he had not lost sight of him. Nobody had lost sight of Nebraska Crane. That wiry, fearless little figure of the Cherokee boy who used to comedown the hill on Locust Street with the bat slung over his shoulder and the well-oiled fielder's mitt protruding from his hip-pocket had been prophetic of a greater destiny, for Nebraska had become a professional baseball player, he had crashed into the big leagues, and his name had been emblazoned in the papers every day.",1
3236,"The newspapers had had a lot to do with his seeing Nebraska that other time. It was in August 1925, just after George had returned to New York from his first trip abroad. That very night, in fact, a little before midnight, as he was seated in a Childs Restaurant with smoking wheatcakes, coffee, and an ink-fresh copy of next morning's Herald-Tribune before him, the headline jumped out at him: ""Crane Slams Another Homer"". He read the account of the game eagerly, and felt a strong desire to see Nebraska again and to get back in his blood once more the honest tang of America. Acting on a sudden impulse, he decided to call him up. Sure enough, his name was in the book, with an address way up in the Bronx. He gave the number and waited. A man's voice answered the phone, but at first he didn't recognise it.",1
3237,"Hello!...Hello!...Is Mr. Crane there?... Is that you, Bras?""  ""Hello. Nebraska's voice was hesitant, slow, a little hostile, touched with the caution and suspicion of mountain people when speaking to a stranger. Who is that?...Who?... Is that you, Monk?""--suddenly and quickly, as he recognised who it was. Well I'll be dogged! he cried. His tone was delighted, astounded, warm with friendly greeting now, and had the somewhat high and faintly howling quality that mountain people's voices often have when they are talking to someone over the telephone: the tone was full, sonorous, countrified, and a little puzzled, as if he were yelling to someone on an adjoining mountain peak on a gusty day in autumn when the wind was thrashing through the trees. Where'd you come from? How the hell are you, boy?"" he yelled before George could answer. Where you been all this time, anyway?""  ""I've been in Europe.",1
3238,"I just got back this morning. Well I'll be dogged!""--still astounded, delighted, full of howling friendliness. When am I gonna see you? How about comin' to the game to-morrow? I'll fix you up. And say,"" he went on rapidly, ""if you can stick aroun' after the game, I'll take you home to meet the wife and kid. How about it?""  So it was agreed.",1
3239,"George went to the game and saw Nebraska knock another home run, but he remembered best what happened afterwards. When the player had had his shower and had dressed, the two friends left the ball park, and as they went out a crowd of young boys who had been waiting at the gate rushed upon them. They were those dark-faced, dark-eyed, dark-haired little urchins who spring up like dragon seed from the grim pavements of New York, but in whose tough little faces and raucous voices there still remains, curiously, the innocence and faith of children everywhere.",1
3240,"It's Bras! the children cried. Hi, Bras! Hey, Bras! In a moment they were pressing round him in a swarming horde, deafening the ears with their shrill cries, begging, shouting, tugging at his sleeves, doing everything they could to attract his attention, holding dirty little scraps of paper towards him, stubs of pencils, battered little note-books, asking him to sign his autograph.",1
3241,"He behaved with the spontaneous warmth and kindliness of his character. He scrawled his name out rapidly on a dozen grimy bits of paper, skilfully working his way along through the yelling, pushing, jumping group, and all the time keeping up a rapid fire of banter, badinage, and good-natured reproof:  ""All right--give it here, then!...Why don't you fellahs pick on somebody else once in a while?...Say, boy! he said suddenly, turning to look down at one unfortunate child, and pointing an accusing finger at him--""What you doin' aroun' here again, to-day? I signed my name fer you at least a dozen times!""  ""No sir, Misteh Crane!",1
3242,"the urchin earnestly replied. Honest--not me!""  ""Ain't that right? Nebraska said, appealing to the other children. Don't this boy keep comin' back here every day? They grinned, delighted at the chagrin of their fellow petitioner.",1
3243,"Dat's right, Misteh Crane! Dat guy's got a whole book wit' nuttin' but yoeh name in it!""  ""Ah-h! the victim cried, and turned upon his betrayers bitterly. What youse guys tryin' to do--get wise or somep'n? Honest, Misteh Crane!""--he looked up earnestly again at Nebraska--""Don't believe 'em! I jest want yoeh ottygraph! Please, Misteh Crane, it'll only take a minute!",1
3244,"For a moment more Nebraska stood looking down at the child with an expression of mock sternness; at last he took the outstretched note-book, rapidly scratched his name across a page, and handed it back. And as he did so, he put his big paw on the urchin's head and gave it a clumsy pat; then, gently and playfully, he shoved it from him, and walked off down the street. The apartment where Nebraska lived was like a hundred thousand others in the Bronx. The ugly yellow brick building had a false front, with meaningless little turrets at the corners of the roof, and a general air of spurious luxury about it. The rooms were rather small and cramped, and were made even more so by the heavy, over-stuffed Grand Rapids furniture. The walls of the living-room, painted a mottled, rusty cream, were bare except for a couple of sentimental coloured prints, while the place of honour over the mantel was reserved for an enlarged and garishly tinted photograph of Nebraska's little son at the age of two, looking straight and solemnly out at all comers from a gilded oval frame.",1
3245,"Myrtle, Nebraska's wife, was small and plump, and pretty in a doll-like way. Her corn-silk hair was frizzled in a halo about her face, and her chubby features were heavily accented by rouge and lipstick. But she was simple and natural in her talk and bearing, and George liked her at once. She welcomed him with a warm and friendly smile and said she had heard a lot about him.",1
3246,"They all sat down. The child, who was three or four years old by this time, and who had been shy, holding on to his mother's dress and peeping out from behind her, now ran across the room to his father and began climbing all over him. Nebraska and Myrtle asked George a lot of questions about himself, what he had been doing, where he had been, and especially what countries he had visited in Europe. They seemed to think of Europe as a place so far away that anyone who had actually been there was touched with an unbelievable aura of strangeness and romance.",1
3247,"Whereall did you go over there, anyway?"" asked Nebraska. Oh, everywhere, Bras,"" George said--""France, England, Holland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Italy--all over the place. Well I'll be dogged!""--in frank astonishment.",1
3248,"You sure do git aroun', don't you?""  ""Not the way you do, Bras. You're travelling most of the time. Who--me?",1
3249,"Oh, hell, I don't git anywhere--just the same ole places. Chicago, St. Looie, Philly--I seen 'em all so often I could find my way blindfolded! He waved them aside with a gesture of his hand. Then, suddenly, he looked at George as though he were just seeing him for the first time, and he reached over and slapped him on the knee and exclaimed: ""Well I'll be dogged! Hot+ you doin', anyway, Monkus?""  ""Oh, can't complain.",1
3250,"How about you? But I don't need to ask that. I've been reading all about you in the papers. Yes, Monkus,"" he said.",1
3251,"I been havin' a good year. But, boy!""--he shook his head suddenly and grinned--""Do the ole dogs feel it! He was silent a moment, then he went on quietly:  ""I been up here since 1919--that's seven years, and it's a long time in this game.",1
3252,"Not many of 'em stay much longer. When you been shaggin' flies as long as that you may lose count, but you don't need to count--your legs'll tell you. But, good Lord, Bras, you're all right!",1
3253,"Why, the way you got around out there to-day you looked like a colt! Yeah,"" Nebraska said, ""maybe I looked like a colt, but I felt like a plough horse. He fell silent again, then he tapped his friend gently on the knee with his brown hand and said abruptly: ""No, Monkus. When you been in this business as long as I have, you know it. Oh, come on, Bras, quit your kidding!",1
3254,"said George, remembering that the player was only two years older than himself. You're still a young man. Why, you're only twenty-seven!""  ""Sure, sure,"" Nebraska answered quietly.",1
3255,"But it's like I say. You cain't stay in this business much longer than I have. Of course, Cobb an' Speaker an' a few like that--they was up here a long time. But eight years is about the average, an' I been here seven already. So if I can hang on a few years more, I won't have no kick to make... Hell! he said in a moment, with the old hearty ring in his voice, ""I ain't got no kick to make, no-way. If I got my release to-morrow, I'd still feel I done all right...Ain't that so, Buzz?"" he cried genially to the child, who had settled down on his knee, at the same time seizing the boy and cradling him comfortably in his strong arm. Ole Bras has done all right, ain't he?""  ""That's the way me an' Bras feel about it,"" remarked Myrtle, who during this conversation had been rocking back and forth, placidly ruminating on a wad of gum.",1
3256,"Along there last year it looked once or twice as if Bras might git traded. He said to me one day before the game, 'Well, ole lady, if I don't git some hits to-day somethin' tells me you an' me is goin' to take a trip.' So I says, 'Trip where?' An' he says, 'I don't know, but they're goin' to sell me down the river if I don't git goin', an' somethin' tells me it's now or never!' So I just looks at him,"" continued Myrtle placidly, ""an' I says, 'Well, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to come to-day or not?' You know, gener'ly, Bras won't let me come when he ain't hittin'--he says it's bad luck. But he just looks at me a minute, an' I can see him sort of studyin' it over, an' all of a sudden he makes up his mind an' says, 'Yes, come on if you want to; I couldn't have no more bad luck than I been havin', no-way, an' maybe it's come time fer things to change, so you come on.' Well, I went--an' I don't know whether I brought him luck or not, but somethin' did,"" said Myrtle, rocking in her chair complacently.",1
3257,"Dogged if she didn't! Nebraska chuckled. I got three hits out of four times up that day, an' two of 'em was home runs!",1
3258,"Yeah,"" Myrtle agreed, ""an' that Philadelphia fast-ball thrower was throwin' 'em, too. He sure was!"" said Nebraska. I know,"" went on Myrtle, chewing placidly, ""because I heard some of the boys say later that it was like he was throwin' 'em up there from out of the bleachers, with all them men in shirt-sleeves right behind him, an' the boys said half the time they couldn't even see the ball. But Bras must of saw it--or been lucky--because he hit two home runs off of him, an' that pitcher didn't like it, either. The second one Bras got, he went stompin' an' tearin' around out there like a wild bull. He sure did look mad,"" said Myrtle in her customary placid tone.",1
3259,"Maddest man I ever seen! Nebraska cried delightedly. I thought he was goin' to dig a hole plumb through to China... But that's the way it was. She's right about it. That was the day I got goin'. I know one of the boys said to me later, 'Bras,' he says, 'we all thought you was goin' to take a ride, but you sure dug in, didn't you?' That's the way it is in this game. I seen Babe Ruth go fer weeks when he couldn't hit a balloon, an' all of a sudden he lams into it. Seems like he just cain't miss from then on. All this had happened four years ago.",1
3260,"Now the two friends had met again, and were seated side by side in the speeding train, talking and catching up on one another. When George explained the reason for his going home, Nebraska turned to him with open-mouthed astonishment, genuine concern written in the frown upon his brown and homely face. Well, what d'you know about that! he said. I sure am sorry, Monk. He was silent while he thought about it, and embarrassed, not knowing what to say. Then, after a moment: ""Gee!""--he shook his head--""your aunt was one swell cook! I never will fergit it! Remember how she used to feed us kids--every danged one of us in the whole neighbourhood? He paused, then grinned up shyly at his friend: ""I sure wish I had a fistful of them good ole cookies of hers right this minute!""  Nebraska's right ankle was taped and bandaged; a heavy cane rested between his knees.",1
3261,"George asked him what had happened. I pulled a tendon,"" Nebraska said, ""an' got laid off. So I thought I might as well run down an' see the folks. Myrtle, she couldn't come--the kid's got to git ready fer school. How are they?",1
3262,"George asked. Oh, fine, fine. All wool an' a yard wide, both of 'em! He was silent for a moment, then he looked at his friend with a tolerant Cherokee grin and said: ""But I'm crackin' up, Monkus. Guess I cain't stan' the gaff much more. Nebraska was only thirty-one now, and George was incredulous.",1
3263,"Nebraska smiled good-naturedly again:  ""That's an ole man in baseball, Monk. I went up when I was twenty-one. I been aroun' a long time. The quiet resignation of the player touched his friend with sadness.",1
3264,"It was hard and painful for him to face the fact that this strong and fearless creature, who had stood in his life always for courage and for victory, should now be speaking with such ready acceptance of defeat. But, Bras,"" he protested, ""you've been hitting just as well this season as you ever did! I've read about you in the papers, and the reporters have all said the same thing. Oh, I can still hit 'em,"" Nebraska quietly agreed.",1
3265,"It ain't the hittin' that bothers me. That's the last thing you lose, anyway. Leastways, it's goin' to be that way with me, an' I talked to other fellahs who said it was that way with them. After a pause he went on in a low tone: ""If this ole leg heals up in time, I'll go on back an' git in the game again an' finish out the season. An' if I'm lucky, maybe they'll keep me on a couple more years, because they know I can still hit. But, hell,"" he added quietly, ""they know I'm through. They already got me all tied up with string. As Nebraska talked, George saw that the Cherokee in him was the same now as it had been when he was a boy.",1
3266,"His cheerful fatalism had always been the source of his great strength and courage. That was why he had never been afraid of anything, not even death. But, seeing the look of regret on George's face, Nebraska smiled again and went on lightly:  ""That's the way it is, Monk.",1
3267,"You're good up there as long as you're good. After that they sell you down the river. Hell, I ain't kickin'. I been lucky. I had ten years of it already, an' that's more than most. An' I been in three World's Serious. If I can hold on fer another year or two--if they don't let me go or trade me--I think maybe we'll be in again. Me an' Myrtle has figgered it all out. I had to help her people some, an' I bought a farm fer Mama an' the Ole Man--that's where they always wanted to be. An' I got three hundred acres of my own in Zebulon--all paid fer, too!--an' if I git a good price this year fer my tobacco, I Stan' to clear two thousand dollars. So if I can git two years more in the League an' one more good World's Serious, why""--he turned his square face towards his friend and grinned his brown and freckled grin, just as he used to as a boy--""we'll be all set. And--you mean you'll be satisfied?",1
3268,"Huh? Satisfied? Nebraska turned to him with a puzzled look. How do you mean?""  ""I mean after all you've seen and done, Bras--the big cities and the crowds, and all the people shouting--and the newspapers, and the headlines, and the World's Series--and--and--the first of March, and St. Petersburg, and meeting all the fellows again, and spring training----""  Nebraska groaned.",1
3269,"Why, what's the matter?""  ""Spring trainin'. You mean you don't like it?""  ""Like it! Them first three weeks is just plain hell. It ain't bad when you're a kid. You don't put on much weight durin' the winter, an' when you come down in the spring it only takes a few days to loosen up an' git the kinks out. In two weeks' time you're loose as ashes. But wait till you been aroun' as long as I have! He laughed loudly and shook his head. Boy! The first time you go after a grounder you can hear your joints creak. After a while you begin to limber up--you work into it an' git the soreness out of your muscles. By the time the season starts, along in April, you feel pretty good. By May you're goin' like a house a-fire, an' you tell yourself you're good as you ever was. You're still goin' strong along in June. An' then you hit July, an' you git them double-headers in St. Looie! Boy, oh boy! Again he shook his head and laughed, baring big square teeth. Monkus,"" he said quietly, turning to his companion, and now his face was serious and he had his black Indian look--""you ever been in St. Looie in July?""  ""No.""  ""All right, then,"" he said very softly and scornfully.",1
3270,"An' you ain't played ball there in July. You come up to bat with sweat bustin' from your ears. You step up an' look out there to where the pitcher ought to be, an' you see four of him. The crowd in the bleachers is out there roastin' in their shirt-sleeves, an' when the pitcher throws the ball it just comes from nowheres--it comes right out of all them shirt-sleeves in the bleachers. It's on top of you before you know it. Well, anyway, you dig in an' git a toe-hold, take your cut, an' maybe you connect. You straighten out a fast one. It's good fer two bases if you hustle. In the old days you could've made it standin' up. But now--boy! He shook his head slowly. You cain't tell me nothin' about that ball park in St. Looie in July! They got it all growed out in grass in April, but after July first""--he gave a short laugh--""hell!--it's paved with concrete! An' when you git to first, them dogs is sayin', 'Boy, let's stay here!' But you gotta keep on goin'--you know the manager is watchin' you--you're gonna ketch hell if you don't take that extra base, it may mean the game. An' the boys up in the press-box, they got their eyes glued on you, too--they've begun to say old Crane is playin' on a dime--an' you're thinkin' about next year an' maybe gittin' in another Serious--an' you hope to God you don't git traded to St. Looie. So you take it on the lam, you slide into second like the Twentieth Century comin' into the Chicago yards--an' when you git up an' feel yourself all over to see if any of your parts is missin', you gotta listen to one of that second baseman's wisecracks: 'What's the hurry, Bras? Afraid you'll be late fer the Veterans' Reunion?'""  ""I begin to see what you mean, all right,"" said George.",1
3271,"See what I mean? Why, say! One day this season I ast one of the boys what month it was, an' when he told me it was just the middle of July, I says to him: 'July, hell! If it ain't September I'll eat your hat!' 'Go ahead, then,' he says, 'an' eat it, because it ain't September, Bras--it's July.' 'Well,' I says, 'they must be havin' sixty days a month this year--it's the longest damn July I ever felt!' An' lemme tell you, I didn't miss it fer, either--I'll be dogged if I did! When you git old in this business, it may be only July, but you think it's September. He was silent for a moment. But they'll keep you in there, gener'ly, as long as you can hit. If you can smack that ole apple, they'll send you out there if they've got to use glue to keep you from fallin' apart. So maybe I'll git in another year or two if I'm lucky. So long's I can hit 'em, maybe they'll keep sendin' me out there till all the other players has to grunt every time ole Bras goes after a ground ball! He laughed. I ain't that bad yet, but soon's I am, I'm through. You won't mind it, then, when you have to quit?""  He didn't answer at once.",1
3272,"He sat there looking out the window at the factory-blighted landscape of New Jersey. Then he laughed a little wearily:  ""Boy, this may be a ride on the train to you, but to me--say!--I covered this stretch so often that I can tell you what telephone post we're passin' without even lookin' out the window. Why, hell yes!""--he laughed loudly now, in the old infectious way--""I used to have 'em numbered--now I got 'em named!",1
3273,"And you think you can get used to spending all your time out on the farm in Zebulon?""  ""Git used to it? In Nebraska's voice there was now the same note of scornful protest that it had when he was a boy, and for a moment he turned and looked at his friend with an expression of astonished disgust. Why, what are you talkin' about? That's the greatest life in the world!""  ""And your father?",1
3274,"How is he, Bras?""  The player grinned and shook his head: ""Oh, the Ole Man's happy as a possum. He's doin' what he wanted to do all his life. And is he well?""  ""If he felt any better he'd have to go to bed.",1
3275,"Strong as a bull,"" said Nebraska proudly. He could wrastle a bear right now an' bite his nose off! Why, hell yes! the player went on with an air of conviction--""he could take any two men I know to-day an' throw 'em over his shoulder!""  ""Bras, do you remember when you and I were kids and your father was on the police force, how he used to wrestle all those professionals that came to town?",1
3276,"There were some good ones, too!""  ""You're damn right there was!"" said the player, nodding his head. Tom Anderson, who used to be South Atlantic champion, an' that fellah Petersen--do you remember him?""  ""Sure. They called him the Bone-Crushing Swede--he used to come there all the time. Yeah, that's him.",1
3277,"He used to wrastle all over the country--he was way up there, one of the best in the business. The Ole Man wrastled him three times, an' throwed him once, too! And that big fellow they called the Strangler Turk----""  ""Yeah, an' he was good, too!",1
3278,"Only he wasn't no Turk--he only called hisself one. The Ole Man told me he was some kind of Polack or Bohunk from the steel mills out in Pennsylvania, an' that's how he got so strong. And the Jersey Giant----""  ""Yeah----""  ""And Cyclone Finnegan----""  ""Yeah----""  ""And Bull Dakota--and Texas Jim Ryan--and the Masked Marvel?",1
3279,"Do you remember the Masked Marvel? Yeah--only there was a whole lot of them--guys cruisin' all over the country callin' theirselves the Masked Marvel. The Ole Man wrastled two of 'em. Only the real Masked Marvel never came to town. The Ole Man told me there was a real Masked Marvel, but he-was too damn good, I guess, to come to Libya Hill. Do you remember the night, Bras, up at the old City Auditorium, when your father was wrestling one of these Masked Marvels, and we were there in the front row rooting for him, and he got a strangle hold on this fellow with the mask, and the mask came off--and the fellow wasn't the Masked Marvel at all, but only that Greek who used to work all night at the Bijou Café for Ladies and Gents down by the depot?""  ""Yeah--haw-haw!",1
3280,"Nebraska threw back his head and laughed loudly. I'd clean fergot that damn Greek, but that's who it was! The whole crowd hollered frame-up an' tried to git their money back--I'll swear, Monk! I'm glad to see you! He put his big brown hand on his companion's knee. It don't seem no time, does it? It all comes back!""  ""Yes, Bras""--for a moment George looked out at the flashing landscape with a feeling of sadness and wonder in his heart--""it all comes back.",1
3281,"George sat by the window and watched the stifled land stroke past him. It was unseasonably hot for September, there had been no rain for weeks, and all afternoon the contours of the eastern seaboard faded away into the weary hazes of the heat. The soil was parched and dusty, and under a glazed and burning sky coarse yellow grasses and the withered stalks of weeds simmered and flashed beside the tracks. The whole continent seemed to be gasping for its breath. In the hot green depths of the train a powder of fine cinders beat in through the meshes of the screens, and during the pauses at stations the little fans at both ends of the car hummed monotonously, with a sound that seemed to be the voice of the heat itself. During these intervals when the train stood still, enormous engines steamed slowly by on adjacent tracks, or stood panting, passive as great cats, and their engineers wiped wads of blackened waste across their grimy faces, while the passengers fanned feebly with sheaves of languid paper or sat in soaked and sweltering dejection.",1
3282,"For a long time George sat alone beside his window. His eyes took in every detail of the changing scene, but his thoughts were turned inward, absorbed in recollections which his meeting with Nebraska Crane had brought alive again. The great train pounded down across New Jersey, across Pennsylvania, across the tip of Delaware, and into Maryland. The unfolding panorama of the land was itself like a sequence on the scroll of time. George felt lost and a little sick. His talk with his boyhood friend had driven him back across the years. The changes in Nebraska and his quiet acceptance of defeat had added an undertone of sadness to the vague, uneasy sense of foreboding which he had got from his conversation with the banker, the politician, and the Mayor.",1
3283,"At Baltimore, when the train slowed to a stop in the gloom beneath the station, he caught a-momentary glimpse of a face on the platform as it slid past his window. All that he could see was a blur of thin, white features and a sunken mouth, but at the corners of the mouth he thought he also caught the shadow of a smile--faint, evil, ghostly--and at sight of it a sudden and unreasoning terror seized him. Could that be Judge Rumford Bland?  As the train started up again and passed through the tunnel on the other side of the city, a blind man appeared at the rear of the car.",1
3284,"The other people were talking, reading, or dozing, and the blind man came in so quietly that none of them noticed him enter. He took the first seat at the end and sat down. When the train emerged into the waning sunlight of this September day, George looked round and saw him sitting there. He just sat quietly, gripping a heavy walnut walking-stick with a frail hand, the sightless eyes fixed in vacancy, the thin and sunken face listening with that terrible intent stillness that only the blind know, and around the mouth hovered that faint suggestion of a smile, which, hardly perceptible though it was, had in it a kind of terrible vitality and the mercurial attractiveness of a ruined angel. It was Judge Rumford Bland!",1
3285,"George had not seen him in fifteen years. At that time he was not blind, but already his eyes were beginning to fail. George remembered him as he was then, and remembered, too, how the sight of the man, frequently to be seen prowling the empty streets of the night when all other life was sleeping and the town was dead, had struck a nameless terror into his boy's heart. Even then, before blindness had come upon him, some nocturnal urge had made him seek deserted pavements beneath the blank and sterile corner lights, past windows that were always dark, past doors that were for ever locked.",1
3286,"He came from an old and distinguished family, and, like all his male ancestors for one hundred years or more, he had been trained in the profession of the law. For a single term he had been a police-court magistrate, and from then on was known as ""Judge"" Bland. But he had fallen grievously from the high estate his family held. During the period of George Webber's boyhood he still professed to be a lawyer. He had a shabby office in a disreputable old building which he owned, and his name was on the door as an attorney, but his living was earned by other and more devious means. Indeed, his legal skill and knowledge had been used more for the purpose of circumventing the law and defeating justice than in maintaining them. Practically all his ""business"" was derived from the negro population of the town, and of this business the principal item was usury.",1
3287,"On the Square, in his ramshackle two-storey building of rusty brick, was ""the store"". It was a second-hand furniture store, and it occupied the ground floor and basement of the building. It was, of course, nothing but a blind for his illegal transactions with the negroes. A hasty and appalled inspection of the mountainous heap of ill-smelling junk which it contained would have been enough to convince one that if the owner had to depend on the sale of his stock he would have to close his doors within a month. It was incredible. In the dirty window was a pool table, taken as brutal tribute from some negro billiard parlour. But what a pool table! Surely it had not a fellow in all the relics in the land. Its surface was full of lumps and dents and ridges. Not a pocket remained without a hole in the bottom big enough to drop a baseball through. The green cloth-covering had worn through or become unfixed in a dozen places. The edges of the table and the cloth itself were seared and burnt with the marks of innumerable cigarettes. Yet this dilapidated object was by all odds the most grandiose adornment of the whole store.",1
3288,"As one peered back into the gloom of the interior he became aware of the most fantastic collection of nigger junk that was ever brought together in one place. On the street floor as well as in the basement it was piled up to the ceiling, and all jumbled together as if some gigantic steam-shovel had opened its jaws and dumped everything just as it was. There were broken-down rocking-chairs, bureaus with cracked mirrors and no bottoms in the drawers, tables with one, two, or three of their legs missing, rusty old kitchen stoves with burnt-out grates and elbows of sooty pipe, blackened frying pans encased in the grease of years, flat irons, chipped plates and bowls and pitchers, washtubs, chamber-pots, and a thousand other objects, all worn out, cracked, and broken.",1
3289,"What, then, was the purpose of this store, since it was filled with objects of so little value that even the poorest negroes could get slight use from them? The purpose, and the way Judge Rumford Bland used it, was quite simple:  A negro in trouble, in immediate need of money to pay a police-court fine, a doctor's bill, or some urgent debt, would come to see Judge Bland. Sometimes he needed as little as five or ten dollars, occasionally as much as fifty dollars, but usually it was less than that. Judge Bland would then demand to know what security he had. The negro, of course, had none, save perhaps a few personal possessions and some wretched little furniture--a bed, a chair, a table, a kitchen stove. Judge Bland would send his collector, bulldog, and chief lieutenant--a ferret-faced man named Clyde Beals--to inspect these miserable possessions, and if he thought the junk important enough to its owner to justify the loan, he would advance the money, extracting from it, however, the first instalment of his interest.",1
3290,"From this point on, the game was plainly and flagrantly usurious. The interest was payable weekly, every Saturday night. On a ten-dollar loan Judge Bland extracted interest of fifty cents a week; on a twenty-dollar loan, interest of a dollar a week; and so on. That is why the amount of the loans was rarely as much as fifty dollars. Not only were the contents of most negro shacks less than that, but to pay two dollars and a half in weekly interest was beyond the capacity of most negroes, whose wage, if they were men, might not be more than five or six dollars a week, and if they were women--cooks or house-servants in the town--might be only three or four dollars. Enough had to be left them for a bare existence or it was no game. The purpose and skill of the game came in lending the negro a sum of money somewhat greater than his weekly wage and his consequent ability to pay back, but also a sum whose weekly interest was within the range of his small income.",1
3291,"Judge Bland had on his books the names of negroes who had paid him fifty cents or a dollar a week over a period of years, on an original loan of ten or twenty dollars. Many of these poor and ignorant people were unable to comprehend what had happened to them. They could only feel mournfully, dumbly, with the slave-like submissiveness of their whole training and conditioning, that at some time in the distant past they had got their money, spent it, and had their fling, and that now they must pay perpetual tribute for that privilege. Such men and women as these would come to that dim-lit place of filth and misery on Saturday night, and there the Judge himself, black-frocked, white-shirted, beneath one dingy, fly-specked bulb, would hold his private court:  ""What's wrong, Carrie?",1
3292,You're two weeks behind in your payments. Is fifty cents all you got this week? It doan seem lak it was three weeks.,1
3293,"Musta slipped up somewheres in my countin'. You didn't slip up. It's three weeks. You owe a dollar fifty. Is this all you got?""  With sullen apology: ""Yassuh.""  ""When will you have the rest of it?""  ""Dey's a fellah who say he gonna give me----""  ""Never mind about that.",1
3294,"Are you going to keep up your payments after this or not?""  ""Dat's whut Ah wuz sayin'. Jus' as soon as Monday come, an' dat fellah----""  Harshly: ""Who you working for now?""  ""Doctah Hollandah----""  ""You cooking for him?""  Sullenly, with unfathomable negro mournfulness: ""Yassuh.""  ""How much is he paying you?""  ""Three dollahs. And you mean you can't keep up?",1
3295,"You can't pay fifty cents a week? Still sullen, dark, and mournful, as doubtful and confused as jungle depths of Africa: ""Doan know...Seem lak a long time since Ah started payin' up----""  Harshly, cold as poison, quick as a striking snake: ""You've never started paying up. You've paid nothing. You're only paying interest, and behind in that.",1
3296,"And still doubtfully, in black confusion, fumbling and fingering and bringing forth at last a wad of greasy little receipts from the battered purse: ""Doan know, seem lak Ah got enough of dese to've paid dat ten dollahs up long ago. How much longer does Ah have to keep on payin'? Till you've got ten dollars...",1
3297,"All right, Carrie: here's your receipt. You bring that extra dollar in next week. Others, a little more intelligent than Carrie, would comprehend more dearly what had happened to them, but would continue to pay because they were unable to get together at one time enough money to release them from their bondage.",1
3298,"A few would have energy and power enough to save their pennies until at last they were able to buy back their freedom. Still others, after paying week by week and month by month, would just give up in despair and would pay no more. Then, of course, Clyde Beals was on them like a vulture. He nagged, he wheedled, and he threatened; and if, finally, he saw that he could get no more money from them, he took their household furniture. Hence the chaotic pile of malodorous junk which filled the shop.",1
3299,"Why, it may be asked, in a practice that was so flagrantly, nakedly, and unashamedly usurious as this, did Judge Rumford Bland not come into collision with the law? Did the police not know from what sources, and in what ways, his income was derived? They knew perfectly. The very store in which this miserable business was carried on was within twenty yards of the City Hall, and within fifty feet of the side entrance to the town calaboose, up whose stone steps many of these same negroes had time and again been hauled and mauled and hurled into a cell. The practice, criminal though it was, was a common one, winked at by the local authorities, and but one of many similar practices by which unscrupulous white men all over the South feathered their own nests at the expense of an oppressed and ignorant people. The fact that such usury was practised chiefly against ""a bunch of niggers"" to a large degree condoned and pardoned it in the eyes of the law.",1
3300,"Moreover, Judge Rumford Bland knew that the people with whom he dealt would not inform on him. He knew that the negro stood in awe of the complex mystery of the law, of which he understood little or nothing, or in terror of its brutal force. The law for him was largely a matter of the police, and the police was a white man in a uniform, who had the power and authority to arrest him, to beat him with his fist or with a club, to shoot him with a gun, and to lock him up in a small, dark cell. It was not likely, therefore, that any negro would take his troubles to the police. He was not aware that he had any rights as a citizen, and that Judge Rumford Bland had violated those rights; or, if he was aware of rights, however vaguely, he was not likely to ask for their protection by a group of men at whose hands he had known only assault, arrest, and imprisonment.",1
3301,"Above the shambles of the nigger junk, upon the second floor, were Judge Bland's offices. A wooden stairway, worn by the tread of clay-booted time, and a hand-rail, loose as an old tooth, smooth, besweated by the touch of many a black palm, led up to a dark hallway. Here, in Stygian gloom, one heard the punctual monotone of a single and regularly repeated small drop of water dripping somewhere in the rear, and caught the overpowering smell of the tin urinal. Opening off of this hall-way was the glazed glass of the office door, which bore the legend in black paint, partly flaked off:  RUMFORD BLAND ATTORNEY AT LAW",1
3302,"Within, the front room was furnished with such lumber as lawyers use. The floor was bare, there were two roll-top desks, black with age, two bookcases with glass doors, filled with battered volumes of old pigskin brown, a spittoon, brass-bodied and capacious, swimming with tobacco juice, a couple of ancient swivel chairs, and a few other nondescript straight-backed chairs for visitors to sit and creak in. On the walls were several faded diplomas--Pine Rock College, Bachelor of Arts; The University of Old Catawba, Doctor of Laws; and a certificate of The Old Catawba Bar Association. Behind was another room with nothing in it but some more bookcases full of heavy tomes in musty calf bindings, a few chairs, and against the wall a plush sofa--the room, it was whispered, ""where Bland took his women"". Out front, in the windows that looked on the Square, their glass unwashed and specked with the ghosts of flies that died when Gettysburg was young, were two old, frayed, mottled-yellow window shades, themselves as old as Garfield, and still faintly marked with the distinguished names of ""Kennedy and Bland"". The Kennedy of that old law firm had been the father of Baxter Kennedy, the Mayor, and his partner, old General Bland, had been Rumford's father. Both bad been dead for years, but no one had bothered to change the lettering.",1
3303,"Such were the premises of Judge Rumford Bland as George Webber remembered them. Judge Rumford Bland--""bondsman"", ""furniture dealer"", usurious lender to the blacks. Judge Rumford Bland--son of a brigadier of infantry, C.S.A., member of the bar, wearer of immaculate white and broadcloth black.",1
3304,What had happened to this man that had so corrupted and perverted his life from its true and honourable direction? No one knew. There was no question that he possessed remarkable gifts. In his boyhood George had heard the more reputable attorneys of the town admit that few of them would have been Judge Bland's match in skill and ability had he chosen to use his talents in an honest way.,1
3305,"But he was stained with evil. There was something genuinely old and corrupt at the sources of his life and spirit. It had got into his blood, his bone, his flesh. It was palpable in the touch of his thin, frail hand when he greeted you, it was present in the deadly weariness of his tone of voice, in the dead-white texture of his emaciated face, in his lank and lustreless auburn hair, and, most of all, in his sunken mouth, around which there hovered constantly the ghost of a smile. It could only be called the ghost of a smile, and yet, really, it was no smile at all. It was, if anything, only a shadow at the corners of the mouth. When one looked closely, it was gone. But one knew that it was always there--lewd, evil, mocking, horribly corrupt, and suggesting a limitless vitality akin to the humour of death, which welled up from some secret spring in his dark soul.",1
3306,"In his early manhood Judge Bland had married a beautiful but dissolute woman, whom he shortly divorced. The utter cynicism that marked his attitude towards women was perhaps partly traceable to this source. Ever since his divorce he had lived alone with his mother, a stately, white-haired lady to whom he rendered at all times a faithful, solicitous, exquisitely kind and gentle duty. Some people suspected that this filial devotion was tinged with irony and contemptuous resignation, but certainly the old lady herself had no cause to think so. She occupied a pleasant old house, surrounded with every comfort, and if she ever guessed by what dark means her luxuries had been assured, she never spoke of it to her son. As for women generally, Judge Bland divided them brutally into two groups--the mothers and the prostitutes--and, aside from the single exception in his own home, his sole interest was in the second division.",1
3307,"He had begun to go blind several years before George left Libya Hill, and the thin, white face, with its shadowy smile, had been given a sinister enhancement by the dark spectacles which he then wore. He was under treatment at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, and made trips there at intervals of six weeks, but his vision was growing steadily worse, and the doctors had already told him that his condition was practically hopeless. The malady that was destroying his sight had been brought on by a loathsome disease which he thought had been checked long since, and which he frankly admitted had been engendered in his eyes.",1
3308,"In spite of all these sinister and revolting facts of character, of spirit, and of person, Judge Bland, astonishing as it may seem, had always been an enormously attractive figure. Everyone who met him knew at once that the man was bad. No, ""bad"" is not the word for it. Everyone knew that he was evil--genuinely, unfathomably evil--and evil of this sort has a grandeur about it not unlike the grandeur of supreme goodness. And indeed, there was goodness in him that had never altogether died. In his single term upon the bench as a police-court magistrate, it was universally agreed that Judge Bland had been fair and wise in his disposal of swift justice. Whatever it was that had made this fact possible--and no one pretended to understand it--the aura of it still clung to him. And it was for just this reason that people who met him were instantly, even if they fought against it, captivated, drawn close to him, somehow made to like him. At the very moment that they met him, and felt the force of death and evil working in him, they also felt--oh, call it the phantom, the radiance, the lost soul, of an enormous virtue. And with the recognition of that quality came the sudden stab of overwhelming regret, the feeling of ""What a loss! What a shame! And yet no one could say why.",1
3309,"As the early dusk of approaching autumn settled swiftly down, the train sped southward towards Virginia. George sat by the window watching the dark shapes of trees flash by, and thought back over all that he had ever known about Judge Rumford Bland. The loathing and terror and mysterious attraction which the man had always had for him were now so great that he felt he could not sit alone there any longer. Midway in the car the other people from Libya Hill had gathered together in a noisy huddle. Jarvis Riggs, Mayor Kennedy, and Sol Isaacs were sitting down or sprawling on the arms of the seats, and Parson Flack was standing in the aisle, leaning over earnestly as he talked, with arms outstretched on the backs of the two seats that enclosed the group. In the centre of this huddle, the focus of all their attention, was Nebraska Crane. They had caught him as he went by, and now they had him cornered.",1
3310,"George rose and went over to join them, and as he did so he glanced again in the direction of Judge Bland. He was dressed with old-fashioned fastidiousness, just as he had always dressed, in loose-fitting garments of plain and heavy black, a starched white shirt, a low collar and a black string neck-tie, and a wide-brimmed Panama hat which he had not removed. Beneath the brim of the hat his once auburn hair was now a dead, and lifeless white. This and the sightless eyes were the only changes in him. Otherwise he looked just as he had looked fifteen years ago. He had not stirred since he came in. Ha sat upright, leaning a little forward on his cane, his blindly staring eyes fixed before him, his white and sunken face held in an attitude of intense, listening stillness.",1
3311,"As George joined the group in the middle of the car, they were excitedly discussing property values--all of them, that is, except Nebraska Crane. Parson Flack would bend over earnestly, showing his big teeth in a smile and tell about some recent deal, and what a certain piece of land had sold for--""Right out there on Charles Street, not far from where you used to live, Bras! To each of these new marvels the player's response was the same:",1
3312,"Well I'll be dogged! he said, astounded. What d'you know about that! The banker now leaned forward and tapped Nebraska confidentially on the knee.",1
3313,"He talked to him persuasively, in friendly wise, urging him to invest his savings in the real estate speculations of the town. He brought up all his heaviest artillery of logic and mathematics, drawing forth his pencil and note-book to figure out just how much a given sum of money could be increased if it was shrewdly invested now in this or that piece of property, and then sold when the time was right. You can't go wrong!"" said Jarvis Riggs, a little feverishly. The town is bound to grow. Why, Libya Hill is only at the beginning of its development. You bring your money back home, my boy, and let it go to work for you! You'll see!""  This went on for some time.",1
3314,"But in the face of all their urgings Nebraska remained his characteristic self. He was respectful and good-natured, but a little dubious, and fundamentally stubborn. I already got me a farm out in Zebulon,"" he said, and, grinning--""It's paid fer, too! When I git through playin' baseball, I'm comin' back an' settle down out there an' farm it. It's three hundred acres of the purtiest bottom land you ever seen. That's all I want. I couldn't use no more. As Nebraska talked to them in his simple, homely way, he spoke as a man of the earth for whom the future opened up serenely, an independent, stubborn man who knew what he wanted, a man who was firmly rooted, established, secure against calamity and want.",1
3315,"He was completely detached from the fever of the times--from the fever of the boom-mad town as well as from the larger fever of the nation. The others talked incessantly about land, but George saw that Nebraska Crane was the only one who still conceived of the land as a place on which to live, and of living on the land as a way of life. At last Nebraska detached himself from the group and said he was going back to take a smoke. George started to follow him. As he passed down the aisle behind his friend and came abreast of the last seat, suddenly a quiet, toneless voice said:  ""Good evening, Webber.",1
3316,"He stopped and spun round. The blind man was seated there before him. He had almost forgotten about him. The blind man had not moved as he spoke. He was still leaning a little forward on his cane, his thin, white face held straight before him as if he were still listening for something. George felt now, as he had always felt, the strange fascination in that evil shadow of a smile that hovered about the corners of the blind man's mouth. He paused, then said:  ""Judge Bland.",1
3317,"Sit down, son. And like a child under the spell of the Pied Piper, he sat down. Let the dead bury their dead. Come sit among the blind. The words were uttered tonelessly, yet their cruel and lifeless contempt penetrated nakedly throughout the car.",1
3318,"The other men stopped talking and turned as if they had received an electric shock. George did not know what to say; in the embarrassment of the moment he blurted out:  ""I--I--there are a lot of people on the train from home. I--I've been talking to them--Mayor Kennedy, and----""  The blind man, never moving, in his terrible toneless voice that carried to all ears, broke in:",1
3319,"Yes, I know. As eminent a set of sons-of-bitches as were ever gathered together in the narrow confines of a single pullman-car. The whole car listened in an appalled silence.",1
3320,"The group in the middle looked at one another with fear in their eyes, and in a moment they began 'talking feverishly again. I hear you were in France again last year,"" the voice now said. And did you find the French whores any different from the homegrown variety? The naked words, with their toneless evil, pierced through the car like a flash of sheer terror.",1
3321,"All conversation stopped. Everyone was stunned, frozen into immobility. You'll find there's not much difference,"" Judge Bland observed calmly and in the same tone. Syphilis makes the whole world kin. And if you want to lose your eyesight, you can do it in this great democracy as well as anywhere on earth. The whole car was as quiet as death.",1
3322,"In another moment the stunned faces turned towards one another, and the men began to talk in furtive whispers. Through all of this the expression on that white and sunken face had never altered, and the shadow of that ghostly smile still lingered around the mouth. But now, low and casually, he said to the young man:  ""How are you, son?",1
3323,"I'm glad to see you. And in that simple phrase, spoken by the blind man, there was the suggestion of a devilish humour, although his expression did not change a bit. You--you've been in Baltimore, Judge Bland?""  ""Yes, I still come up to Hopkins now and then.",1
3324,"It does no good, of course. You see, son,"" the tone was low and friendly now, ""I've gone completely blind since I last saw you. I didn't know.",1
3325,"But you don't mean that you----""  ""Oh, utterly! Utterly!"" replied Judge Bland, and all at once he threw his sightless face up and laughed with sardonic glee, displaying blackened rims of teeth, as if the joke was too good to be kept. My dear boy, I assure you that I am utterly blind. I can no longer distinguish one of our most prominent local bastards two feet off--Now, Jarvis! he suddenly cried out in a chiding voice in the direction of the unfortunate Riggs, who had loudly resumed his discussion of property values--""you know that's not true! Why, man, I can tell by the look in your eyes that you're lying! And again he lifted his face and was shaken by devilish, quiet laughter. Excuse the interruption, son,"" he went on. I believe the subject of our discourse was bastardy. Why, can you believe it?""--he leaned forward again his long fingers playing gently on the polished ridges of his stick--""where bastardy is concerned, I find I can no longer trust my eyes at all. I rely exclusively on the sense of smell. And""--for the first time his face was sunken deliberately in weariness and disgust--""it is enough. A sense of smell is all you need. Abruptly changing now, he said: ""How are the folks? Why--Aunt Maw's dead.",1
3326,"I--I'm going home to the funeral. Dead, is she?""  That was all he said. None of the usual civilities, no expression of polite regret, just that and nothing more. Then, after a moment:  ""So you're going down to bury her.",1
3327,"It was a statement, and he said it reflectively, as though meditating upon it; then--""And do you think you can go home again? George was a little startled and puzzled: ""Why--I don't understand. How do you mean, Judge Bland?""  There was another flare of that secret, evil laughter.",1
3328,"I mean, do you think you can really go home again? Then, sharp, cold, peremptory--""Now answer me! Do you think you can?""  ""Why--why yes!",1
3329,"Why--"" the young man was desperate, almost frightened now, and, earnestly, beseechingly, he said--""why look here, Judge Bland--I haven't done anything--honestly I haven't! Again the low, demonic laughter: ""You're sure? Frantic now with the old terror which the man had always inspired in him as a boy: ""Why--why of course I'm sure!",1
3330,"Look here, Judge Bland--in the name of God, what have I done? He thought desperately of a dozen wild, fantastic things, feeling a sickening and overwhelming consciousness of guilt, without knowing why. He thought: ""Has he heard about my book? Does he know I wrote about the town? Is that what he means?""  The blind man cackled thinly to himself, enjoying with evil tenderness his little cat's play with the young man: ""The guilty fleeth where no man pursueth.",1
3331,"Is that it, son?""  Frankly distracted: ""Why--why--I'm not guilty! Angrily: ""Why damn it, I'm not guilty of anything! Passionately, excitedly: ""I can hold up my head with any man! I can look the whole damn world in the eye! I make no apologies to----""  He stopped short, seeing the evil ghost-shadow of a smile at the corners of the blind man's mouth.",1
3332,"That disease! he thought--""the thing that ruined his eyes--maybe--maybe--why, yes--the man is crazy! Then he spoke, slowly, simply:  ""Judge Bland.",1
3333,"He rose from the seat. Good-bye, Judge Bland. The smile still played about the blind man's mouth, but he answered with a new note of kindness in his voice:  ""Good-bye, son.",1
3334,There was a barely perceptible pause. But don't forget I tried to warn you. George walked quickly away with thudding heart and trembling limbs.,1
3335,"What had Judge Bland meant when he asked, ""Do you think you can go home again? And what had been the meaning of that evil, silent, mocking laughter? What had he heard? What did he know? And these others--did they know, too?",1
3336,"He soon learned that his fear and panic in the blind man's presence were shared by all the people in the car. Even the passengers who had, never seen Judge Bland before had heard his naked, brutal words, and they were now horrified by the sight of him. As for the rest, the men from Libya Hill, this feeling was greatly enhanced, sharpened by all that they knew of him. He had pursued his life among them with insolent shamelessness. Though he still masked in all the outward aspects of respectability, he was in total disrepute, and yet he met the opinion of the town with such cold and poisonous contempt that everyone held him in a kind of terrified respect. As for Parson Flack, Jarvis Riggs, and Mayor Kennedy, they were afraid of him because his blind eyes saw straight through them. His sudden appearance in the car, where none had expected to meet him, had aroused in all of them a sense of stark, underlying terror.",1
3337,"As George went into the washroom suddenly, be came upon the Mayor cleaning his false teeth in the basin. The man's plump face, which George had always known in the guise of cheerful, hearty amiability, was all caved in. Hearing a sound behind him, the Mayor turned upon the newcomer. For a moment there was nothing but nameless fright in his weak brown eyes. He mumbled frantically, incoherently, holding his false teeth in his trembling fingers. Like a man who did not know what he was doing, he brandished them in a grotesque yet terrible gesture indicative of--God knows what!--but despair and terror were both in it. Then he put the teeth into his mouth again, smiled feebly, and muttered apologetically, with some counterfeit of his usual geniality:  ""Ho, ho!--well, son!",1
3338,"You caught me that time, all right! A man can't talk without his teeth! The same thing was now apparent everywhere. George saw it in the look of an eye, the movement of a hand, the give-away expression of a face in repose. The merchant, Sol Isaacs, took him aside and whispered:  ""Have you heard what they're saying about the bank?",1
3339,"He looked around quickly and checked himself, as if afraid of the furtive sound of his own voice. Oh, everything's O.K.! Sure it is! They just went a little too fast there for a while! Things are rather quiet right now--but they'll pick up!",1
3340,"Among all of them there was the same kind of talk that George had heard before. It's worth all of that,"" they told each other eagerly. It'll bring twice as much in a year's time. They caught him by the lapel in the most friendly and hearty fashion and said he ought to settle down in Libya Hill and stay for good--""Greatest place on earth, you know! They made their usual assured pronouncements upon finance, banking, market trends, and property values. But George sensed now that down below all this was just utter, naked, frantic terror--the terror of men who know that they are ruined and are afraid to admit it, even to themselves.",1
3341,"It was after midnight, and the great train was rushing south across Virginia in the moonlight. The people in the little towns lay in their beds and heard the mournful whistle, then the sudden roar as the train went through, and they turned over restlessly and dreamed of fair and distant cities. In K19 most of the passengers had retired to their berths. Nebraska Crane had turned in early, but George was still up, and so, too, were the banker, the Mayor, and the political boss. Crass, world-weary, unimaginative fellows that they were, they were nevertheless too excited by something of the small boy in them that had never died to go to bed at their usual hour aboard a train, and were now drawn together for companionship in the smoke-fogged washroom. Behind the green curtains the complex of male voices rose and fell in talk as they told their endless washroom stories. Quietly, furtively, with sly delight, they began to recall unsavoury anecdotes remembered from the open and shameless life of Judge Rumford Bland, and at the end of each recital there would be a choking burst of strong laughter.",1
3342,"When the laughter and the slapping of thighs subsided, Parson Flack leaned forward again, eager to tell another. In a voice that was subdued, confidential, almost conspiratorial, he began:  ""And do you remember the time that he----?""  Swiftly the curtain was drawn aside, all heads jerked up, and Judge Bland entered. Now, Parson""--said he in a chiding voice--""remember what? Before the blind, cold stare of that emaciated face the seated men were silent. Something stronger than fear was in their eyes.",1
3343,"Remember what? he said again, a trifle harshly. He stood before them erect and fragile, both hands balanced on the head of the cane which he held anchored to the floor in front of him. He turned to Jarvis Riggs: ""Remember when you established what you boasted was 'the fastest-growing bank in all the state'--and weren't too particular what it grew on? He turned back to Parson Flack: ""Remember when one of 'the boys', as you like to call them--you always look out for 'the boys', don't you, Parson?--remember when one of 'the boys' borrowed money from 'the fastest-growing bank' to buy two hundred acres on that hill across the river?""--he turned to the Mayor--""and sold the land to the town for a new cemetery?...Though why,"" he turned his face to Parson Flack again, ""the dead should have to go so far to bury their dead I do not know!",1
3344,"He paused impressively, like a country lawyer getting ready to launch his peroration to a jury. Remember what?""--the voice rose suddenly, high and sharp. Do I remember, Parson, how you've run the town through all these years? Do I remember what a good thing you've made of politics? You've never aspired to public office, have you, Parson? Oh, no--you're much too modest. But you know how to pick the public-spirited citizens who do aspire, and whose great hearts pant with eagerness to serve their fellow men! Ah, yes. It's a very nice little private business, isn't it, Parson? And all 'the boys' are stockholders and get their cut of the profits--is that the way of it, Parson?...Remember what?"" he cried again. Do I remember now the broken fragments of a town that waits and fears and schemes to put off the day of its impending ruin? Why, Parson, yes--I can remember all these things. And yet I had no part in them, for, after all, I am a humble man. Oh""--with a deprecating nod--"" a little nigger squeezing here and there, a little income out of Niggertown, a few illegal lendings, a comfortable practice in small usury--yet my wants were few, my tastes were very simple. I was always satisfied with, say, a modest five per cent a week. So I am not in the big money, Parson. I remember many things, but I see now I have spent my substance, wasted all my talents in riotous living--while pious Puritans have virtuously betrayed their town and given their whole-souled services to the ruin of their fellow men. Again there was an ominous pause, and when he went on his voice was low, almost casual in its toneless irony:  ""I am afraid I have been at best a giddy fellow, Parson, and that my old age will be spent in memories of trivial things--of various merry widows who came to town, of poker chips, racehorses, cards, and rattling dice, of bourbon, Scotch, and rye--all the forms of hellishness that saintly fellows, Parson, who go to prayer-meeting every week, know nothing of.",1
3345,"So I suppose I'll warm my old age with the memories of my own sinfulness--and be buried at last, like all good men and true, among more public benefactors in the town's expensive graveyard on the hill... But I also remember other things, Parson. So can you. And maybe in my humble sphere I, too, have served a purpose--of being the wild oat of more worthy citizens. They sat in utter silence, their frightened, guilty eyes all riveted upon his face, and each man felt as if those cold, unseeing eyes had looked straight through him.",1
3346,"For a moment more Judge Bland just stood there, and, slowly, without a change of muscle in the blankness of his face, the ghostly smile began to hover like a shadow at the corners of his sunken mouth. Good evening, gentlemen,"" he said. He turned, and with his walking-stick he caught and held the curtain to one side. I'll be seeing you. All through the night George lay in his dark berth and watched the old earth of Virginia as it stroked past him in the dream-haunted silence of the moon.",1
3347,"Field and hill and gulch and stream and wood again, the everlasting earth, the huge illimitable earth of America, kept stroking past him in the steep silence of the moon. All through the ghostly stillness of the land, the train made on for ever its tremendous noise, fused of a thousand sounds, and they called back to him forgotten memories: old songs, old faces, old memories, and all strange, wordless, and unspoken things men know and live and feel, and never find a language for--the legend of dark time, the sad brevity of their days, the unknowable but haunting miracle of life itself. He heard again, as he had heard throughout his childhood, the pounding wheel, the tolling bell, the whistle-wail, and he remembered how these sounds, coming to him from the river's edge in the little town of his boyhood, had always evoked for him their tongueless prophecy of wild and secret joy, their glorious promises of new lands, morning, and a shining city. But now the lonely cry of the great train was speaking to him with an equal strangeness of return. For he was going home again.",1
3348,"The undertone of terror with which he had gone to bed, the sadness of the foreshadowed changes in the town, the sombre prospect of the funeral to-morrow, all combined to make him dread his homecoming, which so many times in the years since he had been away he had looked forward to some day with hope and exultation. It was all so different from what he thought it would be. He was still only an obscure instructor at one of the universities in the city, his book was not yet published, he was not by any standard which his native town could know--""successful"", ""a success"". And as he thought of it, he realised that, almost more than anything, he feared the sharp, appraising eye, the worldly judgments, of that little town.",1
3349,"He thought of all his years away from home, the years of wandering in many lands and cities. He remembered how many times he had thought of home with such an intensity of passion that he could close his eyes and see the scheme of every street, and every house upon each street, and the faces of the people, as well as recall the countless things that they had said and the densely-woven fabric of all their histories. To-morrow he would see it all again, and he almost wished he had not come. It would have been easy to plead the excuse of work and other duty. And it was silly, anyhow, to feel as he did about the place.",1
3350,"But why had he always felt so strongly the magnetic pull of home, why had he thought so much about it and remembered it with such blazing accuracy, if it did not matter, and if this little town, and the immortal hills around it, was not the only home he had on earth? He did not know. All that he knew was that the years flow by like water, and that one day men come home again.",1
3351,"The train rushed onward through the moonlit land. 6. The Home-coming When he looked from the windows of the train next morning the hills were there. They towered immense and magical into the blue weather, and suddenly the coolness was there, the winy sparkle of the air, and the shining brightness. Above him loomed huge shapes, the dense massed green of the wilderness, the cloven cuts' and gulches of the mountain passes, the dizzy steepness, with the sudden drops below. He could see the little huts stuck to the edge of bank and hollow, toy-small, far below him in the gorges. The everlasting stillness of the earth now met the intimate, toiling slowness of the train as it climbed up round the sinuous curves, and he had an instant sense of something refound that he had always known--something far, near, strange, and so familiar--and it seemed to him that he had never left the hills, and all that had passed in the years between was like a dream.",1
3352,"At last the train came sweeping down the long sloping bend into the station, But even before it had come to a full halt George had been watching out of the windows and had seen Randy Shepperton and his sister Margaret waiting for him on the platform. Randy, tall and athletic-looking, was teetering restlessly from one foot to another as his glance went back and forth along the windows of the train in search of him. Margaret's strong, big-boned figure was planted solidly, her hands clasped loosely across her waist, and her eyes were darting from car to car with swift intensity. And as George swung down from the steps of the pullman and, valise in hand, strode towards the platform across the rock ballast of the roadbed and the gleaming rails, he knew instantly, with that intuitive feeling of strangeness and recognition; just what they would say to him at the moment of their meeting.",1
3353,"Now they had seen him. He saw Margaret speak excitedly to her brother and motion towards his approaching figure. And now Randy was coming on the run, his broad hand extended in a gesture of welcome, his rich tenor shouting greetings as he came:  ""How are you, boy?"" he shouted.",1
3354,"Put it there! he cried heartily as he came up, and vigorously wrung him by the hand. Glad to see you, Monk!""  Still shouting greetings, he reached over and attempted to take the valise.",1
3355,"The inevitable argument, vehement, good-natured, and protesting, began immediately, and in another moment Randy was in triumphant possession and the two were walking together towards the platform, Randy saying scornfully all the time in answer to the other's protests: Oh, for God's sake, forget about it! I'll let you do as much for me when I come up to the Big Town to visit you!... Here's Margaret! he said as they reached the platform. I know she'll be glad to see you!",1
3356,"She was waiting for him with a broad smile on her homely face. They had grown up together as next-door neighbours, and were almost like brother and sister. As a matter of fact, when George had been ten and Margaret twelve, they had had one of those idyllic romances of childhood in which each pledged eternal devotion to the other and took it for granted that they would marry when they grew up. But the years had changed all that. He had gone away, and she had taken charge of Randy when her parents died; she now kept house for him, and had never married. As he saw her standing there with the warm smile on her face, and with something vaguely spinsterish in her look in spite of her large, full-breasted figure and her general air of hearty good nature, he felt a sudden stirring of pity and old affection for her.",1
3357,"Hello, Margaret! he said, somewhat thickly and excitedly. How are you, Margaret?""  They shook hands, and he planted a clumsy kiss on her face.",1
3358,"Then, blushing with pleasure, she stepped back a pace and regarded him with the half bantering expression she had used so often as a child. Well, well, well! she said. You haven't changed much, George! A little stouter, maybe, but I reckon I'd have known you!""  They spoke now quietly about Aunt Maw and about the funeral, saying the strained and awkward things that people always say when they talk of death.",1
3359,"Then, this duty done, there was a little pause before they resumed their natural selves once more. The two men looked at each other and grinned. When they had been boys together Randy had seemed to George more like Mercutio than anybody he had ever known. He had had a small, lean head, well shaped, set closely with blond hair; he had been quick as a flash, light, wiry, active, with a wonderful natural grace in everything he did; his mind and spirit had been cleat, exuberant, incisive, tempered like a fine Toledo blade. In college, too, he had been the same: he had not only done well in his classes, but had distinguished himself as a swimmer and as quarter-back on the football team.",1
3360,"But now something caught in George's throat as he looked at him and saw what time had done. Randy's lean, thin face was deeply furrowed, and the years had left a grey deposit at his temples. His hair was thinning back on both sides of the forehead, and there were little webbings of fine wrinkles at the corners of the eyes. It saddened George and somehow made him feel a bit ashamed to see how old and worn he looked. But the thing he noticed most was the expression in Randy's eyes. Where they had once been clear and had looked out on the world with a sharp and level gaze, they were now troubled, and haunted by some deep preoccupation which he could not quite shake off even in the manifest joy he felt at seeing his old friend again.",1
3361,"While they stood there, Jarvis Riggs, Parson Flack, and the Mayor came slowly down the platform talking earnestly to one of the leading real estate operators of the town, who had come down to meet them. Randy saw them and, still grinning, he winked at George and prodded him in the ribs. Oh, you'll get it now! he cried in his old extravagant way. At all hours, from daybreak to three o'clock in the morning--no holds barred! They'll be waiting for you when you get there! he chortled.",1
3362,"Who?"" said George. Haw-w! Randy laughed. Why, I'll bet they're all lined up there on the front porch right now, in a reception committee to greet you and to cut your throat, every damned mountain grill of a real estate man in town! Old Horse-face Barnes, Skin-'em-alive Mack Judson, Skunk-eye Tim Wagner, The Demon. Promoter, and Old Squeeze-your-heart's-blood Simms, The Widder and Orphan Man from Arkansas--they're all there! he said gloatingly. She told them you're a prospect, and they're waiting for you! It's your turn now! he yelled. She told them that you're on the way, and they're drawing lots right now to see which one gets your shirt and which one takes the pants and B.V.D.s! Haw-w!""--and he poked his friend in the ribs again.",1
3363,"They'll get nothing out of me,"" George said, laughing, ""for I haven't got it to begin with. That doesn't matter! Randy yelled. If you've got an extra collar button, they'll take that as the first instalment, and then--haw-w! they'll collect your cuff-links, socks, and your suspenders in easy payments as the years roll on!",1
3364,"He stood there laughing at the astounded look on his friend's face. Then, seeing his sister's reproving eye, he suddenly prodded her in the ribs, at which she shrieked in a vexed manner and slapped at his hand. I'll vow, Randy! she cried fretfully. What on earth's the matter with you? Why, you act like a regular idiot! I'll vow you do!""  ""Haw-w!",1
3365,"he yelled again. Then, more soberly, but still grinning: ""I guess we'll have to sleep you out over the garage, Monk, old boy. Dave Merrit's in town, and he's got the spare room. There was a slight note of deference in his voice as he mentioned Merrit's name, but he went on lightly: ""Or if you like--haw-w!--there's a nice room at Mrs. Charles Montgomery Hopper's, and she'd be glad to have you!""  George looked rather uncomfortable at the mention of Mrs. Charles Montgomery Hopper.",1
3366,"She was a worthy lady and he remembered her well, but he didn't want to stay at her boarding-house. Margaret saw his expression and laughed:  ""Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! You see what you're in for, don't you? The prodigal comes home and we give him his choice of Mrs. Hopper or the garage! Now is that life or not?""  ""I don't mind a bit,"" protested George.",1
3367,"I think the garage is swell. And besides""--they all grinned at each other again with the affection of people who know each other so well that they are long past knowledge--""if I get to helling around at night, I won't feel that I'm disturbing you when I come in... But who is Mr. Merrit, anyway?""  ""Why,"" Randy answered, and now he had an air of measuring his words with thoughtful deliberation, ""he--he's the Company's man--my boss, you know.",1
3368,"He travels around to all the branches to check up and see that everything's O.K. He's a fine fellow. You'll like him,"" said Randy seriously. We've told him all about you and he wants to meet you. And we knew you wouldn't mind,"" Margaret said.",1
3369,"You know, it's business, he's with the Company, and of course it's good policy to be as nice to him as we can. But then, because such designing was really alien to her hospitable and whole-hearted spirit, she added: ""Mr. Merrit is all right. I like him. We're glad to have him, anyway. Dave's a fine fellow,"" Randy repeated.",1
3370,"And I know he wants to see you... Well,"" he said, and the preoccupied look was in his eyes again, ""if we're all ready, let's get going. I'm due back at the office now. Merrit's there, of course. Suppose I run you out to the house and drop you, then I'll see you later. This was agreed upon.",1
3371,"Randy grinned once more--a little nervously, George thought--and picked up the valise and started rapidly across the station platform towards his car, which was parked at the kerb. At the funeral that afternoon the little frame house which old Lafayette Joyner--Aunt Maw's father, and George Webber's grandfather--had built with his own hands years ago looked just as it had always looked when George had lived there as a boy. Nothing about it had been changed. Yet it seemed smaller, meaner, more shabby than he remembered it. It was set some distance back from the street, between the Shepperton house on one side and the big brick house in which his Uncle Mark Joyner lived on the other. The street was lined with cars, many of them old and decrepit and covered with the red clay of the hills. In the yard in front of the house many men stood solemnly knotted in little groups, talking quietly, their bare heads and stiff Sunday clothes of austere black giving them an air of self-conscious shyness and restraint.",1
3372,"Inside, the little rooms were jammed with people, and the hush of death was on the gathering, broken now and then by muffled coughs and by stifled sobs and sniffles. Many of them were Joyners, who for three days had been coming in from the hills--old men and women with the marks of toil and pain upon their faces, cousins, in-laws, distant relatives of Aunt Maw. George had never seen some of them before, but they all bore the seal of the Joyner clan upon them, the look of haunting sorrow and something about the thin line of the lips that proclaimed their grim triumph in the presence of death.",1
3373,"In the tiny front room, where on wintry nights Aunt Maw had always sat by the light of a kerosene lamp before a flickering fire, telling the boy her endless stories of death and sorrow, she now lay in her black coffin, the top and front of which were open to display as much of her as possible to the general view. And instantly, as George entered, he knew that one of her main obsessions in life had been victorious over death. A spinster and a virgin all her years, she had always had a horrible fear that, somehow, some day, some man would see her body. As she grew older her thoughts had been more and more preoccupied with death, and with her morbid shame lest someone see her in the state of nature after she was dead. For this reason she had a horror of undertakers, and had made her brother, Mark, and his wife, Mag, solemnly promise that no man would see her unclothed corpse, that her laying out would be done by women, and, above all else, that she was not to be embalmed. By now she had been dead three days--three days of long hot sun and sultriness--and it seemed to George a grim but fitting ending that the last memory he would have of that little house, which in his childhood had been so filled with the stench of death-in-life, should now be the stench of death itself.",1
3374,"Mark Joyner shook hands cordially with his nephew and said he was glad he had been able to come down. His manner was simple, dignified, and reserved, eloquently expressive of quiet grief, for he had always been genuinely fond of his older sister. But Mag, his wife, who for fifty years had carried on a nagging, internecine warfare with Aunt Maw, had appointed herself chief mourner and was obviously enjoying the role. During the interminable service, when the Baptist minister in his twanging, nasal voice recited his long eulogy and went back over the events of Aunt Maw's life, Mag would break forth now and then in fits of loud weeping and would ostentatiously throw back her heavy black veil and swab vigorously with her handkerchief at her red and swollen eyes.",1
3375,"The minister, with the unconscious callousness of self-righteousness, rehearsed again the story of the family scandal. He told how George Webber's father had abandoned his wife, Amelia Joyner, to live in open shame with another woman, and how Amelia had shortly, afterwards ""died of a broken heart"". He told how ""Brother Mark Joyner and his God-fearing wife, Sister Maggie Joyner,"" had been filled with righteous wrath and had gone to court and wrested the motherless boy from the sinful keeping of his father; and how ""this good woman who now lies dead before us"" had taken charge of her sister's son and brought him up in a Christian home. And he said be was glad to see that the young man who had been the recipient of this dutiful charity had come home again to pay his last debt of gratitude at the bier of the one to whom he owed so much.",1
3376,"Throughout all this Mag continued to choke and sputter with histrionic sorrow, and George sat there biting his lips, his eyes fixed on the floor, perspiration streaming from him, his jaws clenched hard, his face purple with shame and anger and nausea. The afternoon wore on, and at last the service was over. People began to issue from the house, and the procession formed for the long, slow ride to the cemetery. With immense relief George escaped from the immediate family group and went over to Margaret Shepperton, and the two of them took possession of one of the limousines that had been hired for the occasion.",1
3377,"Just as the car was about to drive off and take its place in the line, a woman opened the door and got in with them. She was Mrs. Delia Flood, an old friend of Aunt Maw's. George had known her all his life.",1
3378,"Why, hello there, young man,"" she said to George as she climbed in and sat down beside him ""This would've been a proud day for your Aunt Maw if she could've known you'd come all the way back home to be here at her funeral. She thought the world of you, boy. She nodded absent-mindedly to Margaret. I saw you had an empty place here, so I said, 'It's a pity to let it go to waste. Hop right in,' I said. 'Don't stand on ceremony. It might as well be you,' I said, 'as the next fellow.' Mrs. Delia Flood was a childless widow well past middle age, short, sturdy, and physically stolid, with jet black hair and small, piercing brown eyes, and a tongue that was never still.",1
3379,"She would fasten upon anyone she could catch and corner, and would talk on and on in a steady monotone that had neither beginning nor end. She was a woman of property, and her favourite topic of conversation was real estate. In fact, long before the present era of speculation and sky-rocketing prices, she had had a mania for buying and selling land, and was a shrewd judge of values. With some sixth sense she had always known what direction the development of the growing town was likely to take, and when things happened as she predicted, it was usually found that she had bought up choice sites which she was able to sell for much more than she had paid for them. She lived simply and frugally, but she was generally believed to be well off.",1
3380,"For a little while Mrs. Flood sat in contemplative silence. But as the procession moved off and slowly made its way through the streets of the town, she began to glance sharply out of the windows on both sides, and before long, without any preliminary, she launched forth in a commentary on the history of every piece of property they passed. It was constant, panoramic, and exhaustive. She talked incessantly, gesturing briefly and casually with her hand, only pausing from time to time to nod deliberately to herself in a movement of strong affirmation.",1
3381,"You see, don't you? she said, nodding to herself with conviction, tranquilly indifferent whether they listened or not so long as the puppets of an audience were before her. You see what they're goin' to do here, don't you? Why, Fred Barnes, Roy Simms, and Mack Judson--all that crowd--why, yes--here!--say!""--she cried, frowning meditatively--""wasn't I reading it? Didn't it all come out in the paper--why, here, you know, a week or two ago--how they proposed to tear down that whole block of buildings there and were goin' to put up the finest garage in this part of the country? Oh, it will take up the whole block, you know, with a fine eight-storey building over it, and storage space upstairs for more cars, and doctors' offices--why, yes!--they're even thinkin' of puttin' in a roof garden and a big restaurant on top. The whole thing will cost 'em over half a million dollars before they're done with it--oh, paid two thousand dollars a foot for every inch of it! she cried. But pshaw! Why those are Main Street prices--you can get business property up in the centre of town for that! I could've told 'em--but hm!""--with a scornful little tremor of the head--""they didn't want it anywhere but here--no, sir! They'll be lucky if they get out with their skins!""  George and Margaret offered no comment, but Mrs. Flood appeared not to notice, and as the procession crossed the bridge and turned into Preston Avenue she went on:  ""See that house and lot over there!",1
3382,"I paid twenty-five thousand for it two years ago, and now it's worth fifty thousand if it's worth a penny. Yes, and I'll get it, too. But pshaw! See here!""--she shook her head emphatically. They couldn't pull a trick like that on me! I saw what he was up to! Yes! Didn't Mack Judson come to me? Didn't he try to trade with me? Oh, here along, you know, the first part of last April,"" she said impatiently, with a dismissing gesture of her hand, as if all this must be perfectly clear to everyone. All that crowd that's in with him--they were behind him--I could see it plain as day. Says: 'I'll tell you what I'll do. We know you're a good trader, we respect your judgment, and we want you in,' he says, 'and just to have you with us, why, I'll trade you three fine lots I own up there on Pinecrest Road in Ridgewood for that house and lot of yours on Preston Avenue.' Says: 'You won't have to put up a cent. Just to get you in with us I'll make you an even swap!' 'Well,' I said, 'that's mighty fine of you, Mack, and I appreciate the compliment. If you want that house and lot on Preston Avenue,' I said, 'why, I reckon I can let you have it. You know my price,' I said. 'It's fifty thousand. What are those lots in Ridgewood worth?'--came right out and asked him, you know. 'Why,' he says, 'it's hard to say. I don't know just exactly what they are worth,' he says. ' The property up there is goin' up all the time.' I looked him straight in the eye and said to him: 'Well, Mack, I know what those lots are worth, and they're not worth what you paid for 'em. The town's movin' the other way. So if you want my house and lot,' I said, 'just bring me the cash and you can have it. But I won't swap with you.' That's exactly what I told him, and of course that was the end of it. He's never mentioned it again. Oh, yes, I saw what he was up to, all right. Nearing the cemetery, the line of cars passed a place where an unpaved clay road went upwards among fields towards some lonely pines.",1
3383,"The dirt road, at the point where it joined the main highway, was flanked by two portalled shapes of hewn granite blocks set there like markers of a splendid city yet unbuilt which would rise grandly from the hills that swept back into the green wilderness from the river. But now this ornate entrance and a large billboard planted in the field were the only evidences of what was yet to be. Mrs. Flood saw the sign.",1
3384,"Hah? What's that? she cried out in a sharply startled tone. What does it say there?""  They all craned their necks to see it as they passed, and George read aloud the legend on the sign:  RIVERCREST DEDICATED TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF THIS SECTION AND TO THE GLORY OF THE GREATER CITY THEY WILL BUILD Mrs. Flood took in the words with obvious satisfaction.",1
3385,"Ah-hah! she said, nodding her head slowly, with deliberate agreement. That's just exactly it!""  Margaret nudged George and whispered in his ear:  ""Dedicated!",1
3386,"she muttered scornfully--then, with mincing refinement: ""Now ain't that nice? Dedicated to cutting your throat and bleeding you white of every nickel that you've got! They were now entering the cemetery, and the procession wound slowly in along a circling road and at length came to a halt near the rounded crest of the hill below the Joyner burial plot. At one corner of the plot a tall locust tree was growing, and beneath its shade all the Joyners had been buried. There was the family monument--a square, massive chunk of grey, metallic granite, brilliantly burnished, with ""JOYNER"" in raised letters upon its shining surface. On the ends were inscriptions for old Lafayette and his wife, with their names and dates; and, grouped about them, in parallel rows set on the gentle slope, were the graves of Lafayette's children. All these had smaller individual monuments, and on each of these, below the name and dates of birth and death, was some little elegiac poem carved in a Bowing script.",1
3387,"At one side of the burial plot the new-dug grave gaped darkly in the raw earth, and beside it was a mound of loose yellow clay. Ranged above it on the hill were several rows of folding chairs. Towards these the people, who were now getting out of the cars, began to move.  Mark and Mag and various other Joyners took the front rows, and George and Margaret, with Mrs. Flood still close beside them, found chairs at the back.",1
3388,"Other people--friends, distant relatives, and mere acquaintances--stood in groups behind. The lot looked out across a mile or two of deep, dense green, the wooded slopes and hollows that receded towards the winding river, and straight across beyond the river was the central business part of town. The spires and buildings, the old ones as well as some splendid new ones--hotels, office buildings, garages, churches, and the scaffolding and concrete of new construction which exploded from the familiar design with glittering violence--were plainly visible. It was a fine view.",1
3389,"While the people took their places and waited for the pallbearers to perform their last slow and heavy service up the final ascent of the hill, Mrs. Flood sat with her hands folded in her lap and gazed out over the town. Then she began shaking her head thoughtfully, her lips pursed in deprecation and regret, and in a low voice, as if she were talking to herself, she said:  ""Hm! Hm! Hm! Too bad, too bad, too bad! What's that, Mrs. Flood?",1
3390,"Margaret leaned over and whispered. What's too bad?""  ""Why, that they should ever have chosen such a place as this for the cemetery,"" she said regretfully. She had lowered her voice to a stage whisper, and those round her could hear everything she said. Why, as I told Frank Candler just the other day, they've gone and deliberately given away the two best building sites in town to the niggers and the dead people! That's just exactly what they've done! I've always said as much--that the two finest building sites in town for natural beauty are Niggertown and Highview Cemetery. I could've told 'em that long years ago--they should've known it themselves if any of 'em could have seen an inch beyond his nose--that some day the town would grow up and this would be valuable property! Why, why on earth! When they were lookin' for a cemetery site--why on earth didn't they think of findin' one up there on Buxton Hill, say, where you get a beautiful view, and where land is not so valuable? But this! she whispered loudly. This, by rights, is building property! People could have fine homes here! And as for the niggers, I've always said that they'd have been better off if they'd been put down there on those old flats in the depot section. Now it's too late, of course--nothin' can be done--but it was certainly a serious mistake! she whispered, and shook her head. I've always known it!",1
3391,"Well, I guess you're right,"" Margaret whispered in reply. I never thought of it before, but I guess you're right. And she nudged George with her elbow.",1
3392,"The pallbearers had set the coffin in its place, and the minister now began to read the brief and movingly solemn commitment service. Slowly the coffin was lowered in its grave. And as the black lid disappeared from sight George felt such a stab of wordless pain and grief as he had never known. But he knew even as he felt it that it wasn't sorrow for Aunt Maw. It was an aching pity for himself and for all men living, and in it was the knowledge of the briefness of man's days, and the smallness of his life, and the certain dark that comes too swiftly and that has no end. And he felt, too, more personally, now with Aunt Maw gone and no one left in all his family who was close to him, that one whole cycle of time had closed for him. He thought of the future opening blankly up before him, and for a moment he had an acute sense of terror and despair like that of a lost child, for he felt now that the last tie that had bound him to, his native earth was severed, and he saw himself as a creature homeless, uprooted, and alone, with no door to enter, no place to call his own, in all the vast desolation of the planet.",1
3393,"The people had now begun to move away and to walk back slowly towards their cars. The Joyners, however, kept their seats until the last spadeful of earth was heaped and patted into place. Then they arose, their duty done. Some of them just stood there now, talking quietly in their drawling voices, while others sauntered among the tombstones, bending over to read the inscriptions and straightening up to recall and tell each other some forgotten incident in the life of some forgotten Joyner. At last they, too, began to drift away.",1
3394,"George did not want to go back with them and be forced to hear the shreds of Aunt Maw's life torn apart and pieced together again, so he linked his arm through Margaret's and led her over the brow of the hill to the other side. For a little while they stood in the slanting light, silent, their faces to the west, and watched the great ball of the sun sink down behind the rim of distant mountains. And the majestic beauty of the spectacle, together with the woman's quiet presence there beside him, brought calm and peace to the young man's troubled spirit.",1
3395,"When they came back, the cemetery appeared to be deserted. But as they approached the Joyner plot they saw that Mrs. Delia Flood was still waiting for them. They had forgotten her, and realised now that she could not go without them, for there was only one car on the gravelled roadway below and the hired chauffeur was slumped behind his wheel, asleep. In the fast-failing light Mrs. Flood was wandering among the graves, stopping now and then to stoop and peer closely at an inscription on a stone. Then she would stand there meditatively and look out across the town, where the first lights were already beginning to wink on. She turned to them casually when they came up, as though she had taken no notice of their absence, and spoke to them in her curious fragmentary way, plucking the words right out of the middle of her thoughts.",1
3396,"Why, to think,"" she said reflectively, ""that he would go and move her! To think that any man could be so hard-hearted! Oh! she shuddered with a brief convulsive pucker of revulsion. It makes my blood run cold to think of it--and everybody told him so!--they told him so at the time--to think he would have no more mercy in him than to go and move her from the place where she lay buried!""  ""Who was that, Mrs. Flood?",1
3397,"George said absently. Move who?""  ""Why, Amelia, of course--your mother, child! she said impatiently, and gestured briefly towards the weather-rusted stone.",1
3398,"He bent forward and read again the familiar inscription:  Amelia Webber, née Joyner and below her dates the carved verse:  Still is the voice we knew so well, Vanished the face we love, Flown her spirit pure to dwell With angels up above. Ours is the sorrow, ours the pain, And ours the joy alone To clasp her in our arms again In Heaven, by God's throne. That's the thing that started all this movin'! Mrs. Flood was saying. Nobody'd ever have thought of comin' here if it hadn't been for Amelia! And here,"" she cried fretfully, ""the woman had been dead and in her grave more than a year when he gets this notion in his head he's got to move her--and you couldn't reason with him! Why, your uncle, Mark Joyner--that's who it was! You couldn't argue with him! she cried with vehement surprise. Why, yes, of course! It was back there at the time they were havin' all that trouble with your father, child. He'd left Amelia and gone to live with that other woman--but I will say this for him! and she nodded her head with determination. When Amelia died, John Webber did the decent thing and buried her himself--claimed her as his wife and buried her! He'd bought a plot in the old cemetery, and that's where he put her. But then, more than a year afterwards--you know, child--when Mark Joyner had that trouble with your father about who was to bring you up--yes, and took it to the courts and won!--why, that's when it was that Mark took it in his head to move Amelia. Said he wouldn't let a sister of his lie in Webber earth! He already had this plot, of course, way over here on this hill where nobody'd ever thought of goin'. It was just a little private buryin' ground, then--a few families used it, that was all. She paused and looked out thoughtfully over the town, then after a moment she went on:  ""Your Aunt Maw, she tried to talk to Mark about it, but it was like talkin' to a stone wall.",1
3399,"She told me all about it at the time. But no, sir! she shook her head with a movement of strong decision. He'd made up his mind and he wouldn't budge from it an inch! ' But see here, Mark,' she said. ' The thing's not right! Amelia ought to stay where she's buried!' She didn't like the looks of it, you know. 'Even the dead have got their rights,' she said. 'Where the tree falls, there let it lie!'--that's what she told him. But no! He wouldn't listen--you couldn't talk to him. He says: 'I'll move her if it's the last thing I ever live to do! I'll move her if I have to dig her up myself and carry the coffin on my back all the way to the top of that hill across the river! That's where she's goin',' he says, 'and you needn't argue any more!' Well, your Aunt Maw saw then that he had his mind made up and that it wouldn't do any good to talk to him about it. But oh! an awful mistake! an awful mistake! she muttered, shaking her head slowly. All that movin' and expense for nothin'! If he felt that way, he should've brought her over here in the first place, when she died! But I guess it was the lawsuit and all the bad blood it stirred up that made him feel that way,"" she now said tranquilly... And that's the reason all these other people are buried here""--she made a sweeping gesture with her arm--""that's what started it, all right! Why, of course! When the old cemetery got filled up and they had to look round for a new site--why, one of those fellows in Parson Flack's gang at City Hall, he remembered the rumpus about Amelia and thought of all these empty acres way out here beside the old buryin' ground. He found he could buy 'em cheap, and that's what he did. That's exactly how it was,"" she said. But I've always regretted it. I was against it from the start. She fell silent again, and stood looking with solemn-eyed memory at the weather-rusted stone.",1
3400,"Well, as I say, then,"" she went on calmly, ""when your Aunt Maw saw he had his mind made up and that there was no use to try to change him--well, she went out to the old cemetery the day they moved her, and she asked me to go with her, you know. Oh, it was one of those raw, windy days you get in March! The very kind of day Amelia died on. And old Mrs. Wrenn and Amy Williamson--they had both been good friends of Amelia's--of course they went along, too. And, of course, when we got there, they were curious--they wanted to have a look, you know,"" she said calmly, mentioning this grisly desire with no surprise whatever. And they tried to get me to look at it, too. Your Aunt Maw got so sick that Mark had to take her home in the carriage, but I stood my ground. 'No,' I said, 'you go on and satisfy your curiosity if that's what you want to do, but I won't look at it!' I said, 'I'd rather remember her the way she was.' Well, sir, they went ahead and did it then. They got old Prove--you know, he was that old nigger man that worked for Mark--they got him to open up the coffin, and I turned my back and walked away a little piece until they got through lookin',"" she said tranquilly. And pretty soon I heard 'em comin'. Well, I turned round and looked at 'em, and let me tell you somethin',"" she said gravely, ""their faces were a study! Oh, they turned pale and they trembled! ' Well, are you satisfied?' I said. 'Did you find what you were lookin' for?' 'Oh-h! says old Mrs. Wrenn, pale as a ghost, shakin' and wringin' her hands, you know. ' Oh, Delia!' she says, 'it was awful! I'm sorry that I looked!' she says. 'Ah-ha!' I said. 'What did I tell you? You see, don't you?' And she says: 'Oh-h, it was all gone!--all gone!--all rotted away to nothin' so you couldn't recognise her! The face was all gone until you could see the teeth! And the nails had all grown out long! But Delia!' she says, 'the hair!--the hair! Oh, I tell you what;' she says, 'the hair was beautiful! It had grown out until it covered everything--the finest head of hair I ever saw on anyone! But the rest of it--oh, I'm sorry that I looked!' she says. ' Well, I thought so! I thought so!' I said. 'I knew you'd be sorry, so I wouldn't look!'... But that's the way it was, all right,"" she concluded with the quiet satisfaction of omniscience.",1
3401,"Through this recital George and Margaret had stood transfixed, a look of horror on their faces, but Mrs. Flood did not notice them. She stood now looking down at Amelia's tombstone, her lips puckered thoughtfully, and after a little while she said:  ""I don't know when I've thought of Amelia and John Webber--both of 'em dead and in their graves through all these years. She lies here, and he's all alone in his own lot over there on the other side of town, and that old trouble that they had seems very far away. You know,"" she said, looking up and speaking with a tone of deep conviction, ""I believe that they have joined each other and are reconciled and happy. I believe I'll meet them some day in a Higher Sphere, along with all my other friends--all happy, and all leading a new life. She was silent for a moment, and then, with a movement of strong decision, she turned away and looked out towards the town, where the lights were now burning hard and bright and steady in the dusk.",1
3402,"Come, now! she cried briskly and cheerfully. It's time we were goin' home! It's gettin' dark!",1
3403,"The three of them walked in silence down the slope towards the waiting car. As they came up to it and were about to get in, Mrs. Flood stopped and laid her hand on George's shoulder in a warm and easy gesture. Young man,"" she said, ""I've been a long time livin' on this earth, and as the fellow says, the world do move! You've got your life ahead of you, and lots to learn and many things to do--but let me tell you somethin', boy! and all at once she looked at him in a straight and deadly fashion. Go out and see the world and get your fill of wanderin',"" she cried, ""and then come back and tell me if you've found a better place than home! I've seen great changes in my time, and I'll see more before I die. There are great things yet in store for us--great progress, great inventions--it will all come true. Perhaps I'll not live to see it, but you will! We've got a fine town here, and fine people to make it go--and we're not done yet. I've seen it all grow up out of a country village--and some day we will have a great city here. She waited an instant as if she expected him to answer and corroborate her judgment, and when he merely nodded to show that he had heard her, she took it for agreement and went on:  ""Your Aunt Maw always hoped that you'd come home again.",1
3404,And you will! she said. There's no better or more beautiful place on earth than in these mountains--and some day you'll come home again to stay. 7.,1
3405,"Boom Town During the week that followed Aunt Maw's funeral George renewed his acquaintance with his home town, and it was a disconcerting experience. The sleepy little mountain village in which he had grown up--for it had been hardly more than that then--was now changed almost beyond recognition. The very streets that he had known so well, and had remembered through the years in their familiar aspect of early-afternoon emptiness and drowsy lethargy, were now foaming with life, crowded with expensive traffic, filled with new faces he had never seen before. Occasionally he saw somebody that he knew, and in the strangeness of it all they seemed to him like lights shining in the darkness of a lonely coast.",1
3406,"But what he noticed chiefly--and once he observed it he began watching for it, and it was always there--was the look on the people's faces. It puzzled him, and frightened him, and when he tried to find a word to describe it, the only thing he could think of was--madness. The nervous, excited glitter in the eyes seemed to belong to nothing else but madness. The faces of natives and strangers alike appeared to be animated by some secret and unholy glee. And their bodies, as they darted, dodged, and thrust their way along, seemed to have a kind of leaping energy as if some powerful drug was driving them on. They gave him the impression of an entire population that was drunk--drunk with an intoxication which never made them weary, dead, or sodden, and which never wore of, but which incited them constantly to new efforts of leaping and thrusting exuberance.",1
3407,"The people he had known all his life cried out to him along the streets, seizing his hand and shaking it, and saying: ""Hi, there, boy! Glad to see you home again! Going to be with us for a while now? Good! I'll be seeing you! I've got to go on now--got to meet a fellow down the street to sign some papers! Good to see you, boy! Then, having uttered this tempestuous greeting without a pause and without the loss of a stride, pulling and dragging him along with them 'as they wrung his hand, they vanished.",1
3408,"On all sides he heard talk, talk, talk--terrific and incessant. And the tumult of voices was united in variations of a single chorus--speculation and real estate. People were gathered in earnestly chattering groups before the drug-stores, before the post office, before the Court House and the City Hall. They hurried along the pavements talking together with passionate absorption, bestowing half-abstracted nods of greeting from time to time on passing acquaintances.",1
3409,"The real estate men were everywhere. Their motors and buses roared through the streets of the town and out into the country, carrying crowds of prospective clients. One could see them on the porches of houses unfolding blueprints and prospectuses as they shouted enticements and promises of sudden wealth into the ears of deaf old women. Everyone was fair game for them--the lame, the halt, and the blind, Civil War veterans or their decrepit pensioned widows, as well as high school boys and girls, negro truck drivers, soda jerkers, elevator boys, and bootblacks.",1
3410,"Everyone bought real estate; and everyone was ""a real estate man"" either in name or practice. The barbers, the lawyers, the grocers, the butchers, the builders, the clothiers--all were engaged now in this single interest and obsession. And there seemed to be only one rule, universal and infallible--to buy, always to buy, to pay whatever price was asked, and to sell again within two days at any price one chose to fix. It was fantastic. Along all the streets in town the ownership of the land was constantly changing; and when the supply of streets was exhausted, new streets were feverishly created in the surrounding wilderness; and even before these streets were paved or a house had been built upon them, the land was being sold, and then resold, by the acre, by the lot, by the foot, for hundreds of thousands of dollars.",1
3411,"A spirit of drunken waste and wild destructiveness was everywhere apparent. The fairest places in the town were being mutilated at untold cost. In the centre of town there had been a beautiful green opulent with rich lawns and lordly trees, with beds of flowers and banks of honeysuckle, and on top of it there had been an immense, rambling, old wooden hotel. From its windows one could look out upon the vast panorama of mountain ranges in the smoky distance.",1
3412,"George could remember its wide porches and comfortable rockers, its innumerable eaves and gables, its labyrinth of wings and corridors, its great parlours and their thick red carpets, and the lobby with its old red leather chairs, hollowed and shaped by the backs of men, and its smell of tobacco and its iced tinkle of tall drinks. It had a splendid dining-room filled with laughter and quiet voices, where expert negroes in white jackets bent and scraped and chuckled over the jokes of the rich men from the North as with prayerful grace they served them delicious foods out of old silver dishes. George could remember, too, the smiles and the tender beauty of the rich men's wives and daughters. As a boy he had been touched with the unutterable mystery of all these things, for these wealthy travellers had come great distances and had somehow brought with them an evocation of the whole golden and unvisited world, with its fabulous cities and its promise of glory, fame, and love.",1
3413,"It had been one of the pleasantest places in the town, but now it was gone. An army of men and shovels had advanced upon this beautiful green hill and had levelled it down to an ugly flat of clay, and had paved it with a desolate horror of white concrete, and had built stores and garages and office buildings and parking spaces--all raw and new--and were now putting up a new hotel beneath the very spot where the old one had stood. It was to be a structure of sixteen storeys, of steel and concrete and pressed brick. It was being stamped out of the same mould, as if by some gigantic biscuit-cutter of hotels, that had produced a thousand others like it all over the country. And, to give a sumptuous--if spurious--distinction to its patterned uniformity, it was to be called The Libya-Ritz.",1
3414,"One day George ran into Sam Pennock, a boyhood friend and a classmate at Pine Rock College. Sam came down the busy street swiftly at his anxious, lunging stride, and immediately, without a word of greeting, he broke hoarsely into the abrupt and fragmentary manner of speaking that had always been characteristic of him, but that now seemed more feverish than ever:  ""When did you get here?...How long are you going to stay?... What do you think of the way things look here? Then, without waiting for an answer, he demanded with brusque, challenging, and almost impatient scornfulness: ""Well, what do you intend to do--be a two-thousand-dollar-a-year school-teacher all your life? The contemptuous tone, with its implication of superiority--an implication he had noticed before in the attitude of these people, big with their inflated sense of wealth and achievement--stung George to retort sharply:  ""There are worse things than teaching school!",1
3415,"Being a paper millionaire is one of them! As for the two thousand dollars a year, you really get it, Sam! It's not real estate money, it's money you can spend. You can buy a ham sandwich with it. Sam laughed.",1
3416,"You're right! he said. I don't blame you. It's the truth! He began to shake his head slowly. Lord, Lord!"" he said. They've all gone clean out of their heads here... Never saw anything like it in my life... Why, they're all crazy-as a loon! he exclaimed. You can't talk to them... You can't reason with them... They won't listen to you... They're getting prices for property here that you couldn't get' in New York. Are they getting it?""  ""Well,"" he said, with a falsetto laugh, ""they get the first five hundred dollars...",1
3417,"You pay the next five hundred thousand on time. How much time?""  ""God!"" he said. I don't know... All you want, I reckon... For ever!...It doesn't matter... You sell it next day for a million. On time?""  ""That's it!",1
3418,"he cried, laughing. You make half a million just like that. On time?""  ""You've got it!"" said Sam.",1
3419,"On time...God! Crazy, crazy, crazy,"" he kept laughing and shaking his head. That's the way they make it. Are you making it, too?""  At once his manner became feverishly earnest: ""Why, it's the damnedest thing you ever heard of!",1
3420,"he said. I'm raking it in hand over fist!...Made three hundred thousand dollars in the last two months... Why, it's the truth!...Made a trade yesterday and turned round and sold the lot again not two hours later...Fifty thousand dollars just like that! he snapped his fingers. Does your uncle want to sell that house on Locust Street where your Aunt Maw lived?...Have you talked to him about it?...Would he consider an offer? I suppose so, if he gets enough.",1
3421,"How much does be want? he demanded impatiently. Would he take a hundred thousand?""  ""Could you get it for him?",1
3422,"I could get it within twenty-four hours,"" he said. I know a man who'd snap it up in five minutes... I tell you what I'll do, Monk, if you persuade him to sell--I'll split the commission with you...I'll give you five thousand dollars. All right, Sam, it's a go.",1
3423,"Could you let me have fifty cents on account? Do you think he'll sell?"" he asked eagerly. Really, I don't know, but I doubt it. That place was my grandfather's. It's been in the family a long time. I imagine he'll want to keep it. Keep it!",1
3424,"What's the sense in keeping it?... Now's the time when things are at the peak. He'll never get a better offer! I know, but he's expecting to strike oil out in the backyard any time now,"" said George with a laugh.",1
3425,"At this moment there was a disturbance among the tides of traffic in the street. A magnificent car detached itself from the stream of humbler vehicles and moved in swiftly to the kerb, where it came to a smooth stop--a glitter of nickel, glass, and burnished steel. From it a gaudily attired creature stepped down to the pavement with an air of princely indolence, tucked a light Malacca cane carelessly under its right armpit, and slowly and fastidiously withdrew from its nicotined fingers a pair of lemon-coloured gloves, at the same time saying to the liveried chauffeur:  ""You may go, James.",1
3426,"Call for me again in hal-luf an houah! The creature's face was thin and sunken. Its complexion was a deathly sallow--all except the nose, which was bulbous and glowed a brilliant red, showing an intricate network of enlarged purple veins. Its toothless jaws were equipped with such an enormous set of glittering false teeth that the lips could not cover them, and they grinned at the world with the prognathous bleakness of a skeleton. The whole figure, although heavy and shambling, had the tottering appearance which suggested a stupendous debauchery. It moved forward with its false, bleak grin, leaning heavily upon the stick, and suddenly George recognised that native ruin which had been known to him since childhood as Tim Wagner.",1
3427,"J. Timothy Wagner--the ""J"" was a recent and completely arbitrary addition of his own, appropriated, no doubt, to fit his ideas of personal grandeur, and to match the eminent position in the town's affairs to which he had belatedly risen--was the black sheep of one of the old, established families in the community. At the time George Webber was a boy, Tim Wagner had been for so long the product of complete disillusion that there was no longer any vestige of respect attached to him. He had been pre-eminently the town sot. His title to this office was unquestioned. In this capacity he was even held in a kind of affection. His exploits were notorious, the subjects of a hundred stories. One night, for example, the loafers in McCormack's pharmacy had seen Tim swallow something and then shudder convulsively. This process was repeated several times, until the curiosity of the loafers was aroused. They began to observe him furtively but closely, and in a few minutes Tim thrust out his hand slyly, fumbled round in the gold-fish bowl, and withdrew his hand with a wriggling little shape between his fingers. Then the quick swallow and the convulsive shudder were repeated.",1
3428,"He had inherited two fortunes before his twenty-fifth year and had run through them both. Hilarious stories were told of Tim's celebrated pleasure tour upon the inheritance of the second fortune. He had chartered a private car, stocked it plentifully with liquor, and selected as his travelling companions the most notorious sots, vagabonds, and tramps the community could furnish. The debauch had lasted eight months. This party of itinerant bacchuses had made a tour of the entire country. They had exploded their empty flasks against the ramparts of the Rocky Mountains, tossed their empty kegs into San Francisco Bay, strewn the plains with their beer bottles. At last the party had achieved a condition of exhausted satiety in the nation's capital, where Tim, with what was left of his inheritance, had engaged an entire floor at one of the leading hotels. Then, one by one, the exhausted wanderers had drifted back to town, bringing tales of bacchanalian orgies that had not been equalled since the days of the Roman emperors, and leaving Tim finally in solitary possession of the wreckage of empty suites.",1
3429,"From that time on he had slipped rapidly into a state of perpetual sottishness. Even then, however, he had retained the traces of an attractive and engaging personality. Everyone had had a tolerant and unspoken affection for him. Save for the harm he did himself, Tim was an inoffensive and good-natured creature.",1
3430,"His figure on the streets of the town at night had been a familiar one. From sunset on, he might be found almost anywhere. It was easy to tell what progressive state of intoxication he had reached simply by observing his method of locomotion. No one ever saw him stagger. He did not weave drunkenly along the pavement. Rather, when he approached the saturation point, he walked very straight, very rapidly, but with funny little short steps. As he walked he kept his face partly lowered, glancing quickly and comically from side to side, with little possumlike looks. If he approached complete paralysis, he just stood quietly and leaned against something--a lamppost or a door-way or the side of a building or the front of the drugstore. Here he would remain for hours in a state of solemn immobility, broken only by an occasional belch. His face, already grown thin and flabby-jowled, with its flaming beacon of a nose, would at these times be composed in an expression of drunken gravity, and his whole condition would be characterised by a remarkable alertness, perceptiveness, and control. He rarely degenerated into complete collapse. Almost always he could respond instantly and briskly to a word of greeting.",1
3431,"Even the police had had a benevolent regard for him, and they had exercised a friendly guardianship over him. Through long experience and observation, every policeman on the force was thoroughly acquainted with Tim's symptoms. They could tell at a glance just what degree of intoxication he had reached, and if they thought he had crossed the final border line and that his collapse in door-way or gutter was imminent, they would take charge of him, speaking to him kindly, but with a stern warning:  ""Tim, if you're on the streets again to-night, we're going to lock you up.",1
3432,"Now you go on home and go to bed. To this Tim would nod briskly, with instant and amiable agreement: ""Yes, sir, yes, sir. Just what I was going to do, Captain Crane, when you spoke to me. Going home right this minute. Yes, sir.""  With these words he would start off briskly across the street, his legs making their little fast, short steps and his eyes darting comically from side to side, until he had vanished round the corner.",1
3433,"Within ten or fifteen minutes, however, he might be seen again, easing his way along cautiously in the dark shadow of a building, creeping up to the corner, and peeking round with a sly look on his face to see if any of the watchdogs of the law were in sight. As time went on and his life lapsed more and more into total vagabondage, one of his wealthy aunts, in the hope that some employment might partially retrieve him, had given him the use of a vacant lot behind some buildings in the business section of the town, a short half-block from Main Street. The motor-car had now come in sufficient numbers to make parking laws important, and Tim was allowed by his aunt to use this lot as parking space for cars and to keep the money thus obtained. In this employment he succeeded far better than anyone expected. He had little to do except stay on the premises, and this was not difficult for him so long as he was plentifully supplied with corn whisky.",1
3434,"During this period of his life some canvassers at a local election, had looked for Tim to enrol him in the interest of their candidate, but they had been unable to find out where he lived. He had not; lived, of course, with any member of his family for years, and investigation failed to disclose that he had a room anywhere. The question then began to go round: ""Where does Tim Wagner live? Where does he sleep? No one could find out. And Tim's own answers, when pressed for information, were slyly evasive.",1
3435,"One day, however, the answer came to light. The motor-car had come, and come so thoroughly that people were even getting buried by motor-car. The day of the horse-drawn hearse had passed for ever. Accordingly, one of the local undertaking firms had told Tim he could have their old horse-drawn hearse if he would only take it off their premises. Tim had accepted the macabre gift and had parked the hearse in his lot. One day when Tim was absent the canvassers came back again, still persistent in their efforts to learn his address so they could enrol him. They noticed the old hearse, and, seeing that its raven curtains were so closely drawn that the interior was hidden from view, they decided to investigate. Cautiously they opened the doors of the hearse. A cot was inside. There was even a chair. It was completely furnished as a small but adequate bedroom.",1
3436,"So at last his secret had been found out. Henceforth all the town knew where he lived. That was Tim Wagner as George had known him fifteen years ago. Since then he had been so constantly steeped in alcohol that his progressive disintegration had been marked, and he had lately adopted the fantastic trappings of a clown of royalty. Everyone knew all about him, and yet--the fact was incredible!--Tim Wagner had now become the supreme embodiment of the town's extravagant folly. For, as gamblers will stake a fortune on some moment's whimsey of belief, thrusting their money into a stranger's hand and bidding him to play with it because the colour of his hair is lucky, or as racetrack men will rub the hump upon a cripple's back to bring them luck, so the people of the town now listened prayerfully to every word Tim Wagner uttered. They sought his opinion in all their speculations, and acted instantly on this suggestions. He had become--in what way and for what reason no one knew--the high priest and prophet of this insanity of waste.",1
3437,"They knew that he was diseased and broken, that his wits were always addled now with alcohol, but they used him as men once used divining rods. They deferred to him as Russian peasants once deferred to the village idiot. They now believed with an absolute and unquestioning faith that some power of intuition in him made all his judgments infallible.",1
3438,"It was this creature who had just alighted at the kerb a little beyond George Webber and Sam Pennock, full of drunken majesty and bleary-eyed foppishness. Sam turned to him with a movement of feverish eagerness, saying to George abruptly:  ""Wait a minute! I've got to speak to Tim Wagner about something! Wait till I come back!",1
3439,"George watched the scene with amazement. Tim Wagner, still drawing the gloves off of his fingers with an expression of bored casualness, walked slowly over towards the entrance of McCormack's drug-store--no longer were his steps short and quick, for he leaned heavily on his cane--while Sam, in an attitude of obsequious entreaty, kept at his elbow, bending his tall form towards him and hoarsely pouring out a torrent of questions:  ""...Property in West Libya...Seventy-five thousand dollars... Option expires to-morrow at noon... Joe Ingram has the piece above mine...Won't sell... Holding for hundred fifty... Mine's the best location... But Fred Bynum says too far from main road... What do you think, Tim?... Is it worth it?""  During the course of this torrential appeal Tim Wagner did not even turn to look at his petitioner.",1
3440,"He gave no evidence whatever that he heard what Sam was saying. Instead, he stopped, thrust his gloves into his pocket, cast, his eyes round slyly in a series of quick glances, and suddenly began to root into himself violently with a clutching hand. Then he straightened up like a man just coming out of a trance, and seemed to become aware for the first time that Sam was waiting.",1
3441,"What's that? What did you say, Sam?"" he said rapidly. How much did they offer you for it? Don't sell, don't sell! he said suddenly and with great emphasis. Now's the time to buy, not to sell. The trend is upwards. Buy! Buy! Don't take it. Don't sell. That's my advice!""  ""I'm not selling, Tim,"" Sam cried excitedly.",1
3442,"I'm thinking of buying. Oh--yes, yes, yes! Tim muttered rapidly. I see, I see. He turned now for the first time and fixed his eyes upon his questioner. Where did you say it was? he demanded sharply. Deepwood? Good! Good! Can't go wrong! Buy! Buy!",1
3443,"He started to walk away into the drug-store, and the lounging idlers moved aside deferentially to let him pass. Sam rushed after him frantically and caught him by the arm, shouting:  ""No, no, Tim! It's not Deepwood! It's the other way...I've been telling you... It's West Libya!""  ""What's that?",1
3444,"Tim cried sharply. West Libya? Why didn't you say so? That's different. Buy! Buy! Can't go wrong! Whole town's moving in that direction. Values double out there in six months. How much do they want? Seventy-five thousand,"" Sam panted.",1
3445,Option expires tomorrow... Five yeas to pay it up. Buy! Buy!,1
3446,"Tim barked, and walked off into the drug-store. Sam strode back towards George, his eyes blazing with excitement. Did you hear him? Did you hear what he said? he demanded hoarsely. You heard him, didn't you?...Best damned judge of real estate that ever lived... Never known to make a mistake!...'Buy! Buy! Will double in value in six months!'...You were standing right here""--he said hoarsely and accusingly, glaring at George--""you heard what he said, didn't you?""  ""Yes, I heard him.",1
3447,"Sam glanced wildly about him, passed his hand nervously through his hair several times, and then said, sighing heavily and shaking his head in wonder:  ""Seventy-five thousand dollars' profit in one deal!...Never heard anything like it in my...life! Lord, Lord! he cried. What are we coming to? Somehow the news had got round that George had written a book and that it would soon be published.",1
3448,"The editor of the local paper heard of it and sent a reporter to interview him, and printed a story about it. So you've written a book?"" said the reporter. What kind of a book is it? What's it about?""  ""Why--I--I hardly know how to tell you,"" George stammered.",1
3449,"It--it's a novel----""  ""A Southern novel? Anything to do with this part of the country?""  ""Well--yes--that is--it's about the South, all right--about an Old Catawba family--but----""  LOCAL BOY WRITES ROMANCE OF THE OLD SOUTH  George Webber, son of the late John Webber and nephew of Mark Joyner, local hardware merchant, has written a novel with a Libya Hill background which the New York house of James Rodney & Co. will publish this autumn. When interviewed last night, the young author stated that his book was a romance of the Old South, centring about the history of a distinguished antebellum family of this region. The people of Libya Hill and environs will await the publication of the book with special interest, not only because many of them will remember the author, who was born and brought up here, but also because that stirring period of Old Catawba's past has never before been accorded its rightful place of honour in the annals of Southern literature.",1
3450,"We understand you have travelled a great deal since you left home. Been to Europe several times?""  ""Yes, I have. In your opinion, how does this section of the country compare with other places you have seen?""  ""Why--why--er--why good!...",1
3451,"I mean, fine! That is----""  LOCAL PARADISE COMPARES FAVOURABLY In answer to the reporter's question as to how this part of the country compared to other places he had seen, the former Libya man declared:  ""There is no place I have ever visited--and my travels have taken me to England, Germany, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, to say nothing of the south of France, the Italian Riviera, and the Swiss Alps--which can compare in beauty with the setting of my native town.",1
3452,"We have here,"" he said enthusiastically, ""a veritable Paradise of Nature. Air, climate, scenery, water, natural beauty, all conspire to make this section the most ideal place in the whole world to live. Did you ever think of coming back here to live?",1
3453,"Well--yes--I have thought of it--but--you see----""  WILL SETTLE AND BUILD HERE  When questioned as to his future plans, the author said:  ""For years, my dearest hope and chief ambition has been that one day I should be able to come back here to live. One who has ever known the magic of these hills cannot forget them. I hope, therefore, that the time is not far distant when I may return for good.",1
3454,"Here, I feel, as nowhere else,"" the author continued wistfully, ""that I will be able to and the inspiration that I must have to do my work. Scenically, climatically, geographically, and in every other way, the logical spot for a modern renaissance is right here among these hills. There is no reason why, in ten years' time, this community should not be a great artistic colony, drawing to it the great artists, the music and the beauty lovers, of the whole world, as Salzburg does now. The Rhododendron Festival is already a step in the right direction.",1
3455,"It shall be a part of my purpose from now on,"" the earnest young author added, ""to do everything in my power to further this great cause, and to urge all my writing and artistic friends to settle hereto make Libya Hill the place it ought to be--The Athens of America. Do you intend to write another book?""  ""Yes--that is--I hope so. In fact--""  ""Would you care to say anything about it?""  ""Well--I don't know--it's pretty hard to say----""  ""Come on, son, don't be bashful.",1
3456,"We're all your home folks here... Now, take Longfellow. There was a great writer! You know what a young fellow with your ability ought to do? He ought to come back here and do for this section what Longfellow did for New England...""  PLANS NATIVE SAGA  When pressed for details about the literary work he hopes to do hereafter, the author became quite explicit:  ""I want to return here,"" he said, ""and commemorate the life, history, and development of Western Catawba in a series of poetic legends comparable to those with which the poet Longfellow commemorated the life of the Acadians and the folklore of the New England countryside.",1
3457,"What I have in mind is a trilogy that will begin with the early settlement of the region by the first pioneers, among them my own forebears, and will trace the steady progress of Libya Hill from its founding and the coming of the railroad right down to its present international prominence and the proud place it occupies to-day as 'The Gem City of the Hills'. George writhed and swore when he read the article. There was hardly an accurate statement in it. He felt angry and sheepish and guilty all at the same time.",1
3458,"He sat down and wrote a scathing letter to the paper, but when he had finished he tore it up. After all, what good would it do? The reporter had spun his story out of nothing more substantial than his victim's friendly tones and gestures, a few words and phrases which he had blurted out in his confusion, and, above all, his reticence to talk about his work; yet the fellow had obviously been so steeped in the booster spirit that he had been able to concoct this elaborate fantasy--probably without quite knowing that it was a fantasy.",1
3459,"Then, too, he reflected, people would take an emphatic denial of the statements that had been attributed to him as evidence that he was a sorehead, full of conceit about his book. You couldn't undo the effect of a thing like this with a simple negative. If he gave the lie to all that gush, everybody would say he was attacking the town and turning against those who had nurtured him. Better let bad enough alone.",1
3460,"So he did nothing about it. And after that, strangely enough, it seemed to George that the attitude of people changed towards him. Not that they had been unfriendly before. It was only that he now felt they approved of him. This in itself gave him a quiet sense of accomplishment, as if the stamp of business confirmation had been put upon him.",1
3461,"Like all Americans, George had been amorous of material success, so it made him happy now to know that the people of his home town believed he had got it, or at any rate was at last on the highroad to it. One thing about the whole affair was most fortunate. The publisher who had accepted his book had an old and much respected name; people knew the name, and would meet him on the street and wring his hand and say:  ""So your book is going to be published by James Rodney & Co.?",1
3462,"That simple question, asked with advance knowledge of the fact, had a wonderful sound. It had a ring, not only of congratulation that his book was being published, but also of implication that the distinguished house of Rodney had been fortunate to secure it. That was the way it sounded, and it was probably also the way it was meant. He had the feeling, therefore, that in the eyes of his own people he had ""arrived"". He was no longer a queer young fellow who had consumed his substance in the deluded hope that he was--oh, loaded word!--""a writer"". He was a writer. He was not only a writer, but a writer who was about to be published, and by the ancient and honourable James Rodney & Co.",1
3463,"There is something good in the way people welcome success, or anything--no matter what--that is stamped with the markings of success. It is not an ugly thing, really. People love success because to most of them it means happiness, and, whatever form it takes, it is the image of what they, in their hearts, would like to be. This is more true in America than anywhere else. People put this label on the image of their heart's desire because they have never had an image of another kind of happiness. So, essentially, this love of success is not a bad thing, but a good thing. It calls forth a general and noble response, even though the response may also be mixed with self-interest. People are happy for your happiness because they want so much to be happy themselves. Therefore it's a good thing. The idea behind it is good, anyhow. The only trouble with it is that the direction is misplaced.",1
3464,"That was the way it seemed to George. He had gone through a long and severe period of probation, and now he was approved. It made him very happy. There is nothing in the world that will take the chip off of one's shoulder like a feeling of success. The chip was off now, and George didn't want to fight anybody. For the first time he felt that it was good to be home again.",1
3465,"Not that he did not have his apprehensions. He knew what he had written about the people and the life of his home town. He knew, too, that he had written about them with a nakedness and directness which, up to that time, had been rare in American fiction. He wondered how they would take it. Even when people congratulated him about the book he could not altogether escape a feeling of uneasiness, for he was afraid of what they would say and think after the book came out and they had read it.",1
3466,"These apprehensions took violent possession of him one night in a most vivid and horrible dream. He thought he was running and stumbling over the blasted heath of some foreign land, fleeing in terror from he knew not what. All that he knew was that he was filled with a nameless shame. It was wordless, and as shapeless as a smothering fog, yet his whole mind and soul shrank back in an agony of revulsion and self-contempt. So overwhelming was his sense of loathing and guilt that he coveted the place of murderers on whom the world had visited the fierceness of its wrath. He envied the whole list of those criminals who had reaped the sentence of mankind's dishonour--the thief, the liar, the trickster, the outlaw, and the traitor--men whose names were anathema and were spoken with a curse, but which were spoken; for he had committed a crime for which there was no name, he was putrescent with a taint for which there was neither comprehension nor cure, he was rotten with a vileness of corruption that placed him equally beyond salvation or vengeance, remote alike from pity, love, and hatred, and unworthy of a curse. Thus he fled across the immeasurable and barren heath beneath a burning sky, an exile in the centre of a planetary vacancy which, like his own shameful self, had no place either among things living or among things dead, and in which there was neither vengeance of lightning nor mercy of burial; for in all that limitless horizon there was no shade or shelter, no curve or bend, no hill or tree or hollow: there was only one vast, naked eye--searing and inscrutable--from which there was no escape, and which bathed his defenceless soul in its fathomless depths of shame.",1
3467,"And then, with bright and sharp intensity, the dream changed, and suddenly he found himself among the scenes and faces he had known long ago. He was a traveller who had returned after many years of wandering to the place he had known in his childhood. The sense of his dreadful but nameless corruption still hung ominously above him as he entered the streets of the town again, and he knew that he had returned to the springs of innocence and health from whence he came, and by which he would be saved.",1
3468,"But as he came into the town he became aware that the knowledge of his guilt was everywhere about him. He saw the men and women he had known in childhood, the boys with whom he had gone to school, the girls he had taken to dances. They were engaged in all their varied activities of life and business, and they showed their friendship towards one another, but when he approached and offered his hand in greeting they looked at him with blank stares, and in their gaze there was no love, hatred, pity, loathing, or any feeling whatsoever. Their faces, which had been full of friendliness and affection when they spoke to one another, went dead; they gave no sign of recognition or of greeting; they answered him briefly in toneless voices, giving him what information he asked, and repulsed every effort he made towards a resumption of old friendship with the annihilation of silence and that blank and level stare. They did not laugh or mock or nudge or whisper when he passed; they only waited and were still, as if they wanted but one thing--that he should depart out of their sight.",1
3469,"He walked on through the old familiar streets, past houses and places that lived again for him as if he had never left them, and by people who grew still and waited until he had gone, and the knowledge of wordless guilt was rooted in his soul. He knew that he was obliterated from their lives more completely than if he had died, and he felt that he was now lost to all men. Presently he had left the town, and was again upon the blasted heath, and he was fleeing across it beneath the pitiless sky where flamed the naked eye that pierced him with its unutterable weight of shame.",1
3470,"8. The Company George considered himself lucky to have the little room over the Shepperton garage. He was also glad that his visit had overlapped that of Mr. David Merrit, and that Mr. Merrit had been allowed to enjoy undisturbed the greater comfort of the Shepperton guest room, for Mr. Merrit had filled him with a pleasant glow at their first meeting. He was a ruddy, plump, well-kept man of forty-five or so, always ready with a joke and immensely agreeable, with pockets bulging with savoury cigars which he handed out to people on the slightest provocation. Randy had spoken of him as ""the Company's man,"" and, although George did not know what the duties of a ""Company's man"" were, Mr. Merrit made them seem very pleasant.",1
3471,"George knew, of course, that Mr. Merrit was Randy's boss, and he learned that Mr. Merrit was in the habit of coming to town every two or three months. He would arrive like a benevolent, pink-cheeked Santa Claus, making his jolly little jokes, passing out his fat cigars, putting his arm round people's shoulders, and, in general, making everyone feel good. As he said himself:  ""I've got to turn up now and then just to see that the boys are behaving themselves, and not taking in any wooden nickels.",1
3472,"Here he winked at George in such a comical way that all of them had to grin. Then he gave George a big cigar. His functions seemed to be ambassadorial. He was always taking Randy and the salesmen of the Company out to lunch or dinner, and, save for brief visits to the office, he seemed to spend most of his time inaugurating an era of good feeling and high living. He would go around town and meet everybody, slapping people on the back and calling them by their first names, and for a week after he had left the business men of Libya Hill would still be smoking his cigars. When he came to town he always stayed ""out of the house"", and one knew that Margaret would prepare her best meals for him, and that there would be some good drinks. Mr. Merrit supplied the drinks himself, for he always brought along a plentiful store of expensive beverages. George could see at their first meeting that he was the kind of man who exudes an aura of good fellowship, and that was why it was so pleasant to have Mr. Merrit staying in the house.",1
3473,"Mr. Merrit was not only a nice fellow. He was also ""with the Company"", and George soon realised that ""the Company"" was a vital and mysterious force in all their lives. Randy had gone with it as soon as he left college. He had been sent to the main office, up North somewhere, and had been put through a course of training. Then he had come back South and had worked his way up from salesman to district agent--an important member of the sales organisation.",1
3474,"The Company"", ""district agent"", ""the sales organisation""--mysterious titles all of them, but most comforting. During the week George was in Libya Hill with Randy and Margaret, Mr. Merrit was usually on hand at meal times, and at night he would sit out on the front porch with them and carry on in his jolly way, joking and laughing and giving them all a good time. Sometimes he would talk shop with Randy, telling stories about the Company and about his own experiences in the organisation, and before long George began to pick up a pretty good idea of what it was all about.",1
3475,"The Federal Weight, Scales, and Computing Company was a far-flung empire which had a superficial aspect of great complexity, but in its essence it was really beautifully simple. Its heart and soul--indeed, its very life--was its sales organisation. The entire country was divided into districts, and over each district an agent was appointed. This agent, in turn, employed salesmen to cover the various portions of his district. Each district also had an ""office man"" to attend to any business that might come up while the agent and his salesmen were away, and a ""repair man"" whose duty it was to overhaul damaged or broken-down machines. Together, these comprised the agency, and the country was so divided that there was, on the average, an agency for every unit of half a million people in the total population. Thus there were two hundred and sixty or seventy agencies through the nation, and the agents with their salesmen made up a working force of from twelve to fifteen hundred men.",1
3476,"The higher purposes of this industrial empire, which the employees almost never referred to by name, as who should speak of the deity with coarse directness, but always with a just perceptible lowering and huskiness of the voice as ""the Company""--these higher purposes were also beautifully simple. They were summed up in the famous utterance of the Great Man himself, Mr. Paul S. Appleton, III, who invariably repeated it every year as a peroration to his hour-long address before the assembled members of the sales organisation at their national convention. Standing before them at the close of each year's session, he would sweep his arm in a gesture of magnificent command towards an enormous map of the United States of America that covered the whole wall behind him, and say:  ""There's your market!",1
3477,"Go out and sell them! What could be simpler and more beautiful than this? What could more eloquently indicate that mighty sweep of the imagination which has been celebrated in the annals of modern business under the name of ""vision""? The words had the spacious scope and austere directness that have characterised the utterances of great leaders in every epoch of man's history. It is Napoleon speaking to his troops in Egypt: ""Soldiers, from the summit of yonder pyramids, forty centuries look down upon you. It is Captain Perry: ""We have met the enemy, and they are ours. It is Dewey at Manila Bay: ""You may fire when ready, Gridley. It is Grant before Spottsylvania Court House: ""I propose to fight it out on this line, if it takes all summer.",1
3478,"So when Mr. Paul S. Appleton, III, waved his arm at the wall and said: ""There's your market! Go out and sell them!""--the assembled captains, lieutenants, and privates in the ranks of his sales organisation knew that there were still giants in the earth, and that the age of romance was not dead. True, there had once been a time when the aspirations of the Company had been more limited. That was when the founder of the institution, the grandfather of Mr. Paul S. Appleton, III, had expressed his modest hopes by saying: ""I should like to see one of my machines in every store, shop, or business that needs one, and that can afford to pay for one. But the self-denying restrictions implicit in the founder's statement had long since become so out of date as to seem utterly mid-Victorian. Mr. David Merrit admitted it himself. Much as he hated to speak ill of any man, and especially the founder of the Company, he had to confess that by the standards of 1929 the old gentleman had lacked vision.",1
3479,"That's old stuff now,"" said Mr. Merrit, shaking his head and winking at George, as though to take the curse off of his treason to the founder by making a joke of it. We've gone way beyond that! he exclaimed with pardonable pride. Why, if we waited nowadays to sell a machine to someone who needs one, we'd get nowhere. He was nodding now at Randy, and speaking with the seriousness of deep conviction. We don't wait until he needs one. If he says he's getting along all right without one, we make him buy one anyhow. We make him see the need, don't we, Randy? In other words, we create the need. This, as Mr. Merrit went on to explain, was what is known in more technical phrase as ""creative salesmanship"" or ""creating the market"".",1
3480,"And this poetic conception was the inspired work of one man--none other than the present head of the Company, Mr. Paul S. Appleton, III, himself. The idea had come to him in a single blinding flash, born full-blown like Pallas Athene from the head of Zeus, and Mr. Merrit still remembered the momentous occasion as vividly as if it had been only yesterday. It was at one of the meetings of the assembled parliaments of the Company that Mr. Appleton, soaring in an impassioned flight of oratory, became so intoxicated with the grandeur of his own vision that he stopped abruptly in the middle of a sentence and stood there as one entranced, gazing out dreamily into the unknown vistas of magic Canaan; and when he at last went on again, it was in a voice surcharged with quivering emotion:",1
3481,"My friends,"" he said, ""the possibilities of the market, now that we see how to create it, are practically unlimited! Here he was silent for a moment, and Mr. Merrit said that the Great Man actually paled and seemed to stagger as he tried to speak, and that his voice faltered and sank to an almost inaudible whisper, as if he himself could hardly comprehend the magnitude of his own conception. My friends""--he muttered thickly, and was seen to clutch the rostrum for support--""my friends--seen properly""--he whispered, and moistened his dry lips--""seen properly--the market we shall create being what it is""--his voice grew stronger, and the clarion words now rang forth--""there is no reason why one of our machines should not be in the possession of every man, woman, and child in the United\ States! Then came the grand, familiar gesture to the map: ""There's your market, boys! Go out and sell them!",1
3482,"Henceforth this vision became the stone on which Mr. Paul S. Appleton, III, erected the magnificent edifice of the true church and living faith which was called ""the Company"". And in the service of this vision Mr. Appleton built up an organisation which worked with the beautiful precision of a locomotive piston. Over the salesman was the agent, and over the agent was the district supervisor, and over the district supervisor was the district manager, and over the district manager was the general manager, and over the general manager was--if not God himself, then the next thing to it, for the agents and salesmen referred to him in tones of proper reverence as ""P. S. A.""  Mr. Appleton also invented a special Company Heaven known as the Hundred Club.",1
3483,"Its membership was headed by P. S. A., and all the ranks of the sales organisation were eligible, down to the humblest salesman. The Hundred Club was a social order, but it was also a good deal more than that. Each agent and salesman had a ""quota""--that is to say, a certain amount of business which was assigned to him as the normal average of his district and capacity. A man's quota differed from another's according to the size of his territory, its wealth, and his own experience and ability. One man's quota would be sixty, another's eighty, another's ninety or one hundred, and if he was a district agent, his quota would be higher than that of a mere salesman. Each man, however, no matter how small or how large his quota might be, was eligible for membership in the Hundred Club, the only restriction being that he must average one hundred per cent of his quota. If he averaged more--if he got, say, one hundred and twenty per cent of his quota--there were appropriate honours and rewards, not only social but financial as well. One could be either high up or low down in the Hundred Club, for it had almost as many degrees of merit as the Masonic order.",1
3484,"The unit of the quota system was ""the point"", and a point was forty dollars' worth of business. So if a salesman had a quota of eighty, this meant that he had to sell the products of the Federal Weight, Scales, and Computing Company to the amount of at least $3200 every month, or almost $40,000 a year. The rewards were high. A salesman's commission was from fifteen to twenty per cent of his sales; an agent's from, twenty to twenty-five per cent. Beyond this there were bonuses to be earned by achieving or surpassing his quota. Thus it was possible for an ordinary salesman in an average district to earn from $6,000 to $8,000 a year, while an agent could earn from $12,000 to $15,000, and even more if his district was an exceptionally good one.",1
3485,"So much for the rewards of Mr. Appleton's Heaven. But what would Heaven be if there were no Hell? So Mr. Appleton was forced by the logic of the situation to invent a Hell, too. Once a man's quota was fixed at any given point, the Company never reduced it. Moreover, if a salesman's quota was eighty points and he achieved it during the year, he must be prepared at the beginning of the new year to find that his quota had been increased to ninety points. One had to go onwards and upwards constantly, and the race was to the swift.",1
3486,"While it was quite true that membership in the Hundred Club was not compulsory, it was also true that Mr. Paul S. Appleton, III, was a theologian who, like Calvin, knew how to combine free will and predestination. If one did not belong to the Hundred Club, the time was not far distant when one would not belong to Mr. Appleton. Not to belong to it was, for agent or salesman, the equivalent of living on the other side of the railroad tracks. If one failed of admission to the Company Heaven, or if one dropped out, his fellows would begin to ask guardedly: ""Where's Joe Klutz these days? The answers would be vague, and in the course of time Joe Klutz would be spoken of no more. He would fade into oblivion. He was ""no longer with the Company"".",1
3487,"Mr. Paul S. Appleton, III, never had but the one revelation--the one which Mr. Merrit so movingly described--but that was enough, and he never let its glories and allurements grow dim. Four times a year, at the beginning of each quarter, he would call his general manager before him and say: ""What's the matter, Elmer? You're not getting the business! The market is there! You know what you can do about it--or else...! Thereupon the general manager would summon the district managers one by one and repeat to them the words and manner of P. S. A., and the district managers would reenact the scene before each of the district supervisors, who would duplicate it to the agents, who would pass it on to the salesmen, who, since they had no one below them, would ""get out and hustle--or else! This was called ""keeping up the morale of the organisation. As Mr. David Merrit sat on the front porch and told of his many experiences with the Company, his words conveyed to George Webber a great deal more than he actually said.",1
3488,"For his talk went on and on in its vein of mellow reminiscence, and Mr. Merrit made his little jokes and puffed contentedly at one of his own cigars, and everything he said carried an overtone of ""What a fine and wonderful thing it is to be connected with the Company!""  He told, for example, about the splendid occasion every year when all the members of the Hundred Club were brought together for what was known as ""The Week of Play"". This was a magnificent annual outing conducted ""at the Company's expense"". The meeting place might be in Philadelphia or Washington, or in the tropic opulence of Los Angeles or Miami, or it might be on board a chartered ship--one of the small but luxurious twenty-thousand-tonners that ply the transatlantic routes--bound to Bermuda or Havana. Wherever it was, the Hundred Club was given a free sweep. If the journey was by sea, the ship was theirs--for a week. All the liquor in the world was theirs, if they could drink it--and Bermuda's coral isles, or the unlicensed privilege of gay Havana. For that one week everything on earth that money could buy was at the command of the members of the Hundred Club, everything was done on the grand scale, and the Company--the immortal, paternal, and great-hearted Company--""paid for everything"".",1
3489,"But as Mr. Merrit painted his glowing picture of the fun they had on these occasions, George Webber saw quite another image. It was an image of twelve or fifteen hundred men--for on these pilgrimages, by general consent, women (or, at any rate, wives) were debarred--twelve or fifteen hundred men, Americans, most of them in their middle years, exhausted, overwrought, their nerves frayed down and stretched to the breaking point, met from all quarters of the continent ""at the Company's expense"" for one brief, wild, gaudy week of riot. And George thought grimly what this tragic spectacle of business men at play meant in terms of the entire scheme of things and the plan of life that had produced it. He began to understand, too, the changes which time had brought about in Randy.",1
3490,"The last day of his week in Libya Hill, George had gone to the station to buy his return ticket and he stopped in at Randy's office a little before one o'clock to go home to lunch with him. The outer salesroom, with its shining stock of scales and computing machines imposingly arrayed on walnut pedestals, was deserted, so he sat down to wait. On one wall hung a gigantic coloured poster. August Was the Best Month in Federal History,"" it read. Make September a Better One! The Market's There, Mr. Agent. The Rest Is Up to You!""  Behind the salesroom was a little partitioned Space which served Randy as an office.",1
3491,"As George waited, gradually he became aware of mysterious sounds emanating from beyond the partition. First there was the rustle of heavy paper, as if the pages of a ledger were being turned, and occasionally there would be a quick murmur of hushed voices, confidential, ominous, interspersed with grunts and half-suppressed exclamations. Then all at once there were two loud bangs, as of a large ledger being slammed shut and thrown upon a desk or table, and after a moment's silence the voices rose louder, distinct, plainly audible. Instantly he recognised Randy's voice--low, grave, hesitant, and deeply troubled. The other voice he had never heard before.",1
3492,"But as he listened to that voice he began to tremble and grow white about the lips. For its very tone was a foul insult to human life, an ugly sneer whipped across the face of decent humanity, and as he realised that that voice, these words, were being used against his friend, he had a sudden blind feeling of murder in his heart. And what was so perplexing and so troubling was that this devil's voice had in it as well a curiously familiar note, as of someone he had known.",1
3493,"Then it came to him in a flash--it was Merrit speaking! The owner of that voice, incredible as it seemed, was none other than that plump, well-kept, jolly-looking man who had always been so full of hearty cheerfulness and good spirits every time he had seen him. Now, behind that little partition of glazed glass and varnished wood, this man's voice had suddenly become fiendish. It was inconceivable, and as George listened he grew sick, as one does in some awful nightmare when he visions someone he knows doing some perverse and abominable act. But what was most dreadful of all was Randy's voice, humble, low, submissive, modestly entreating. Merrit's voice would cut across the air like a gob of rasping phlegm, and then Randy's voice--gentle, hesitant, deeply troubled--would come in from time to time in answer.",1
3494,"Well, what's the matter? Don't you want the job? Why--why, yes, you know I do, Dave--haw-w""--and Randy's voice lifted a little in a troubled and protesting laugh.",1
3495,"What's the matter that you're not getting the business? Why--haw-w!""--again the little laugh, embarrassed and troubled--""I thought I was----""  ""Well, you're not! that rasping voice cut in like a knife. This district ought to deliver thirty per cent more business than you're getting from it, and the Company is going to have it, too--or else! You deliver or you go right out on your can! See? The Company doesn't give a damn about you! It's after the business! You've been around a long time, but you don't mean a damn bit more to the Company than anybody else! And you know what's happened to a lot of other guys who got to feeling they were too big for their job--don't you?""  ""Why--why, yes, Dave--but--haw-w!",1
3496,"the little laugh again""--but--honestly, I never thought----""  ""We don't give a damn what you never thought! the brutal voice ripped in. I've given you fair warning now! You get the business or out you go!",1
3497,"The glazed glass door burst open violently and Merrit came striding out of the little partitioned office. When he saw George, he looked startled. Then he was instantly transformed. His plump and ruddy face became wreathed in smiles, and he cried out in a hearty tone:",1
3498,"Well, well, well Look who's here! If it's not the old boy himself!""  Randy had followed him out, and Merrit now turned and winked humorously at him, in the manner of a man who is carrying on a little bantering byplay: Randy,"" he said, ""I believe George gets better looking from day to day. Has he broken any hearts yet? Randy tried to smile, grey-faced and haggardly.",1
3499,"I bet you're burning them up in the Big Town,"" said Merrit, turning back to George. And, say, I read that piece in the paper about your book. Great stuff, son! We're all proud of you!",1
3500,"He gave George a hearty slap on the back and turned away with an air of jaunty readiness, picked up his hat, and said cheerfully: Well, what d'ya say, folks? What about one of Margaret's famous meals, out at the old homestead? Well, you can't hurt my feelings. I'm ready if you are. Let's go!",1
3501,"And, smiling, ruddy, plump, cheerful, a perverted picture of amiable good will to all the world, he sauntered through the door. For a moment the two old friends just stood there looking at each other, white and haggard, with a bewildered expression in their eyes. In Randy's eyes there was also a look of shame. With that instinct for loyalty which was one of the roots of his soul, he said:  ""Dave's a good fellow...",1
3502,"You--you see, he's got to do these things... He--he's with the Company. George didn't say anything.",1
3503,"For as Randy spoke, and George remembered all that Merrit had told him about the Company, a terrific picture flashed through his, mind. It was a picture he had seen in a gallery somewhere, portraying a long line of men stretching from the Great Pyramid to the very portals of great Pharaoh's house, and great Pharaoh stood with a thonged whip in his hand and applied it unmercifully to the bare back and shoulders of the man in front of him, who was great Pharaoh's chief overseer, and in the hand of the overseer was a whip of many tails which he unstintedly applied to the quivering back of the wretch before him, who was the chief overseer's chief lieutenant, and in the lieutenant's hand a whip of rawhide which he laid vigourously on the quailing body of his head sergeant, and in the sergeant's hand a wicked flail with which he belaboured a whole company of groaning corporals, and in the hands of every corporal a knotted lash with which to whack a whole regiment of slaves, who pulled and hauled and bore burdens and toiled and sweated and built the towering structure of the pyramid. So George didn't say anything. He couldn't. He had just found out something about life that he had not known before.",1
3504,"9. The City of Lost Men Late that afternoon George asked Margaret to go with him to the cemetery, so she borrowed Randy's car and drove him out. On the way they stopped at a florist's and bought some chrysanthemums, which George placed on Aunt Maw's grave. There had been a heavy rain during the week and the new-made mound had sunk an inch or two, leaving a jagged crack round its edges.",1
3505,"As he laid the flowers on the damp, raw earth, suddenly it struck him as strange that he should be doing it. He was not a sentimental person, and for a moment it puzzled him that he should be making this gesture. He hadn't planned to do it. He had simply seen the florist's window as they drove along and, without thinking, had stopped and got the flowers, and now there they were.",1
3506,"Then he realised why he had done it--and why he had wanted to come back to the cemetery at all. This visit to Libya Hill, which he had dreamed about so many times as his home-coming, and which had not turned out in any way as he had thought it would be, was really his leave-taking, his farewell. The last tie that had bound him to his native earth was severed, and he was going out from here to make a life for himself as each man must--alone.",1
3507,"And now, once again, the dusk was falling in this place, and in the valley below the lights were beginning to come on in the town. With Margaret at his side, he stood there and looked down upon it, and she seemed to understand his feelings, for she was quiet and said nothing. Then, in a low voice, George began to speak to her. He needed to tell someone all that he had thought and felt during his week at borne. Randy was not available, and Margaret was the only one left to whom he could talk. She listened without interruption as he spoke about his book and his hopes for it, telling her as well as he could what kind of book it was, and how much he feared that the town would not like it. She pressed his arm reassuringly, and the gesture was more eloquent than any words could be.",1
3508,"He did not say anything about Randy and Merrit. There was no need to alarm her unduly, no sense in robbing her of that security which is so fundamental to a woman's peace and happiness. Sufficient unto the day...",1
3509,"But he spoke at length about the town itself, telling her all that he had seen of its speculative madness, and how it had impressed him. What did the future hold for that place and its people? They were always talking of the better life that lay ahead of them and of the greater city they would build, but to George it seemed that in all such talk there was evidence of a strange and savage hunger that drove them on, and that there was a desperate quality in it, as though what they really hungered for was ruin and death. It seemed to him that they were ruined, and that even when they laughed and shouted and smote each other on the back, the knowledge of their ruin was in them.",1
3510,"They had squandered fabulous sums in meaningless streets and bridges. They had torn down ancient buildings and erected new ones large enough to take care of a city of half a million people. They had levelled hills and bored through mountains, making magnificent tunnels paved with double roadways and glittering with shining tiles--tunnels which leaped out on the other side into Arcadian wilderness. They had flung away the earnings of a lifetime, and mortgaged those of a generation to come. They had ruined their city, and in doing so had ruined themselves, their children, and their children's children.",1
3511,"Already the town had passed from their possession. They no longer owned it. It was mortgaged under a debt of fifty million dollars, owned by bonding companies in the North. The very streets they walked on had been sold beneath their feet. They signed their names to papers calling for the payment of fabulous sums, and resold their land the next day to other madmen who signed away their lives with the same careless magnificence. On paper, their profits were enormous, but their ""boom"" was already over and they would not see it. They were staggering beneath obligations to pay which none of them could meet--and still they bought.",1
3512,"And when they had exhausted all their possibilities of ruin and extravagance that the town could offer, they had rushed out into the wilderness, into the lyrical immensities of wild earth where there was land enough for all men living, and they had staked off little plots and wedges in the hills as one might try to stake a picket fence out in the middle of the ocean. They had given fancy names to all these foolish enterprises--""Wild Boulders""--""Shady Acres""--""Eagle's Crest"". They had set prices on these sites of forest, field, and tangled undergrowth that might have bought a mountain, and made charts and drawings showing populous communities of shops, houses, streets, roads, and clubs in regions where there was no road, no street, no house, and which could not be reached in any way save by a band of resolute pioneers armed with axes. These places were to be transformed into idyllic colonies for artists and writers and critics; and there were colonies as well for preachers, doctors, actors, dancers, golf players, and retired locomotive engineers. There were colonies for everyone, and, what is more, they sold the lots--to one another!",1
3513,"But under all this flash and play of great endeavour, the paucity of their designs and the starved meagreness of their lives were already apparent. The better life which they talked about resolved itself into a few sterile and baffled gestures. All they really did for themselves was to build uglier and more expensive homes, and buy new cars, and join a country club. And they did all this with a frenzied haste, because--it seemed to George--they were looking for food to feed their hunger and had not found it.",1
3514,"As he stood upon the hill and looked out on the scene that spread below him in the gathering darkness, with its pattern of lights to mark the streets and the creeping pin-pricks of the thronging traffic, he remembered the barren night-time streets of the town he had known so well in his boyhood. Their dreary and unpeopled desolation had burned its acid print upon his memory. Bare and deserted by ten o'clock at night, those streets had been an aching monotony, a weariness of hard lights and empty pavements, a frozen torpor broken only occasionally by the footfalls of some prowler--some desperate, famished, lonely man who hoped past hope and past belief for some haven of comfort, warmth, and love there in the wilderness, for the sudden opening of a magic door into some secret, rich, and more abundant life. There had been many such, but they had never found what they were searching for. They had been dying in the darkness--without a goal, a certain purpose, or a door.",1
3515,"And that, it seemed to George, was the way the thing had come. That was the way it had happened. Yes, it was there--on many a night long past and wearily accomplished, in ten thousand little towns and in ten million barren streets where all the passion, hope, and hunger of the famished men beat like a great pulse through the fields of darkness--it was there and nowhere else that all this madness had been brewed.",1
3516,"As he remembered the bleak, deserted streets of night which he had known here fifteen years before, he thought again of Judge Rumford Bland, whose solitary figure ranging restlessly through the sleeping town had been so familiar to him and had struck such terror in his heart. Perhaps he was the key to this whole tragedy. Perhaps Rumford Bland had sought his life in darkness not because of something evil in him--though certainly there was evil there--but because of something good that had not died. Something in the man had always fought against the dullness of provincial life, against is predudice, its caution, its smugness, its sterility, and its lack of joy. He had looked for something better in the night, for a place of warmth and fellowship, a moment of dark mystery, the thrill of imminent and unknown adventure, the excitement of the hunt, pursuit, perhaps the capture, and then the fulfilment of desire. Was it possible that in the blind man whose whole life had become such a miracle of open shamelessness, there had once been a warmth and an energy that had sought for an enhancement of the town's cold values, and for a joy and a beauty that were not there, but that lived in himself alone? Could that be what had wrecked him? Was he one of the lost men--lost, really, only because the town itself was lost, because his gifts had been rejected, his energies unused, the shoulder of his strength finding no work to bend to--because what he had had to give of hope, intelligence, curiosity, and warmth had found no place there, and so were lost?",1
3517,"Yes, the same thing that explained the plight the town had come to might also explain Judge Rumford Bland. What was it he had said on the train: ""Do you think you can 'go home again? And: ""Don't forget I tried to warn you. Was this, then, what he had meant? If so, George understood him now.",1
3518,"Around them in the cemetery as George thought these things and spoke of them, the air brooded with a lazy, drowsy warmth. There was the last evening cry of robins, and the thrumming bullet noises in undergrowth and leaf, and broken sounds from far away--a voice in the wind, a boy's shout, the barking of a dog, the tinkle of a cowbell. There was the fragrance of intoxicating odours--the resinous smell of pine, and the smells of grass and warm sweet clover. All this was just as it had always been. But the town of his childhood, with its quiet streets and the old houses which had been almost obscured below the leafy spread of trees, was changed past recognition, scarred now with hard patches of bright concrete and raw dumps of new construction. It looked like a battlefield, cratered and shell torn with savage explosions of brick, cement, and harsh new stucco-And in the interspaces only the embowered remnants of the old and pleasant town remained--timid, retreating, overwhelmed--to remind one of the liquid leather shuffle in the quiet streets at noon when the men came home to lunch, and of laughter and low voices in the leafy rustle of the night. For this was lost!",1
3519,"An old and tragic light was shining faintly on the time-enchanted hills. George thought of Mrs. Delia Flood, and what she had said of Aunt Maw's hope that some day he'd come home again to stay.. And as he stood there with Margaret quietly by his side the old and tragic light of fading day shone faintly on their faces, and all at once it seemed to him that they were fixed there like a prophecy with the hills and river all round them, and that there was something lost, intolerable, foretold and come to pass, something like old time and destiny--some magic that he could not say.",1
3520,"Down by the river's edge, in darkness now, he heard the bell, the whistle, and the pounding wheel of the night express coming into town, there to pause for half an hour and then resume its northward journey. It swept away from them, leaving the lonely thunder of its echoes in the hills and the flame-flare of its open firebox for a moment, and then just heavy wheels and rumbling cars as the great train pounded on the rails across the river--and, finally, nothing but the silence it had left behind. Then, farther off and almost lost in the traffic of the town, he heard again and for the last time its wailing cry, and it brought to him once more, as it had done for ever in his childhood, its wild and secret exultation, its pain of going, and its triumphant promise of morning, new lands, and a shining city. And something in his heart was saying, like a demon's whisper that spoke of flight and darkness: ""Soon! Soon! Soon!""  Then they got in the car and drove rapidly away from the great hill of the dead, the woman towards the certitude of lights, the people, and the town; the man towards the train, the city, and the unknown future.",1
3521,"BOOK II - THE WORLD THAT JACK BUILT Back in New York the autumn term at the School for Utility cultures had begun, and George Webber took up again the old routine of academic chores. He hated teaching worse than ever, and found that even in his classes he was thinking about his new book and looking forward eagerly to his free hours when he could work upon it. It was hardly more than just begun, but for some reason the writing was going well, and George knew from past experience that he'd better take advantage of every moment while the frenzy of creation was upon him. He felt, too, almost desperately, that he ought to get as much of the new book written as he could before the first was published. That event, at once so desired and dreaded, now loomed before him imminently. He hoped the critics would be kind, or at least would treat his novel with respect. Fox Edwards said it ought to have a good critical reception, but that you couldn't tell anything about sales: better not think too much about it.",1
3522,"George was seeing Esther Jack every day, just as always, but in his excitement over the approaching publication of Home to Our Mountains and his feverish absorption in the new writing he was doing, she no longer occupied the forefront of his thoughts and feelings. She was aware of this and resented it, as women always do. Perhaps that's why she invited him to the party, believing that in such a setting she would seem more desirable to him and that thus she could recapture the major share of his attention. At any rate, she did invite him. It was to be an elaborate affair. Her family and all her richest and most brilliant friends were to be there, and she begged him to come.",1
3523,"He refused. He told her he had his work to do. He said he had his world and she had hers, and the two could never be the same. He reminded her of their compromise. He repeated that he did not want to belong to her world, that he had seen enough of it already, and that if she insisted on trying to absorb him in her life she was going to destroy the foundation on which their whole relationship had rested since he had come back to her.",1
3524,"But she kept after him and brushed his arguments aside. Sometimes you sound just like a fool, George! she said impatiently. Once you get an idea in your head, you cling to it in the face of reason itself Really, you ought to go out more. You spend too much time cooped up here in your rooms,"" she said. It's unhealthy! And how can you expect to be a writer if you don't take part in the life round you? I know what I'm talking about,"" she said, her face flushed with eager seriousness. And, besides, what has all this nonsense about your world and my world got to do with us? Words, words, words! Stop being silly, and listen to me. I don't ask much of you. Do as I say this once, just to please me. In the end she beat him down and he yielded.",1
3525,"All right,"" he muttered at last, defeated, without enthusiasm. I'll go. So September slid into October, and now the day of the great party had dawned.",1
3526,"Later, as George looked back upon it, the date took on an ominous significance, for the brilliant party was staged exactly a week before the thunderous crash in the Stock Market which marked the end of an era.  10. Jack at Morn At seven twenty-eight Mr. Frederic Jack awoke and began to come alive with all his might. He sat up and yawned strongly, stretching his arms and at the same time bending his slumber-swollen face into the plump muscle-hammock of his right shoulder, a movement coy and cuddlesome. Eee-a-a-a-ach! He stretched deliciously out of thick, rubbery sleep, and for a moment he sat heavily upright rubbing at his eyes with the clenched backs of his fingers. Then he flung off the covers with one determined motion and swung to the floor. His toes groped blindly in soft grey carpet stuff, smooth as felt, for his heelless slippers of red Russian leather. These found and slipped into, he padded noiselessly across the carpet to the window and stood, yawning and stretching again, as he looked out with sleepy satisfaction at a fine, crisp morning. Instantly he knew that it was October 17th, 1929, and the day of the party. Mr. Jack liked parties. Nine floors below him the cross street lay gulched in steep morning shadow, bluish, barren, cleanly ready for the day. A truck roared past with a solid rattling heaviness. An ash-can was banged on the pavement with an abrupt slamming racket. Upon the pavement a little figure of a man, foreshortened from above and covered by its drab cone of grey, bobbed swiftly along, turned the corner into Park Avenue, and was gone, heading southward towards work.",1
3527,"Below Mr. Frederick Jack the cross street was a narrow bluish lane between sheer cliffs of solid masonry, but to the west the morning sunlight, golden, young, immensely strong and delicate, cut with sculptured sharpness at the walls of towering buildings. It shone with an unearthly rose-golden glow upon the upper tiers and summits of soaring structures whose lower depths were still sunk in shadow. It rested without violence or heat upon retreating pyramids of steel and stone, fumed at their peaks with fading wisps of smoke. It was reflected with dazzling brilliance from the panes of innumerable lofty windows, and it made the wall surfaces of harsh white-yellow brick look soft and warm, the colour of rose petals.",1
3528,"Among the man-made peaks that stood silhouetted against the sky in this early sun were great hotels and clubs and office buildings bare of life. Mr. Jack could look straight into high office suites ready for their work: the morning light shaped patterns out of pale-hued desks and swivel-chairs of maple, and it burnished flimsy partition woods and thick glazed doors. The offices stood silent, empty, sterile, but they also seemed to have a kind of lonely expectation of the life that soon would well up swiftly from the streets to fill and use them. In the eerie light, with the cross street still bare of traffic and the office buildings empty, suddenly it seemed to Mr. Jack as if all life had been driven or extinguished from the city and as if those soaring obelisks were all that remained of a civilization that had been fabulous and legendary.",1
3529,"With a shrug of impatience he shook off the moment's aberration and peered down into the street again. It was empty as before, but already along Park Avenue the bright-hued cabs were drilling past the intersection like beetles in flight, most of them headed downtown in the direction of Grand Central Station. And everywhere, through that shining, living light, he could sense the slow-mounting roar of another furious day beginning. He stood there by his window, a man-mite poised high in the air upon a shelf of masonry, the miracle of God, a plump atom of triumphant man's flesh, founded upon a rock of luxury at the centre of the earth's densest web--but it was as the Prince of Atoms that he stood there and surveyed the scene, for he had bought the privileges of space, silence, light, and steel-walled security out of chaos with the ransom of an emperor, and he exulted in the price he paid for them. This grain of living dust had seen the countless insane accidents of shape and movement that daily passed the little window of his eye, but he felt no doubt or fear. He was not appalled.",1
3530,"Another man, looking out upon the city in its early-morning nakedness, might have thought its forms inhuman, monstrous, and Assyrian in their insolence. But not Mr. Frederick Jack. Indeed, if all those towers had been the monuments of his own special triumph, his pride and confidence and sense of ownership could hardly have been greater than they were. My city,"" he thought. Mine. It filled his heart with certitude and joy because he had learned, like many other men, to see, to marvel, to accept, and not to ask disturbing questions. In that arrogant boast of steel and stone he saw a permanence surviving every danger, an answer, crushing and conclusive, to every doubt.",1
3531,"He liked what was solid, rich, and spacious, made to last. He liked the feeling of security and power that great buildings gave him. He liked especially the thick walls and floors of this apartment house. The boards neither creaked nor sagged when he walked across them; they were as solid as if they had been hewn in one single block from the heart of a gigantic oak. All this, he felt, was as it should be.",1
3532,"He was a man who liked order in everything. The rising tide of traffic which now began to stream below him in the streets was therefore pleasing to him. Even in the thrust and jostle of the crowd his soul rejoiced, for he saw order everywhere. It was order that made the millions swarm at morning to their work in little cells, and swarm again at evening from their work to other little cells. It was an order as inevitable as the seasons, and in it Mr. Jack read the same harmony and permanence which he saw in the entire visible universe round him.",1
3533,"Mr. Jack turned and glanced about his room. It was a spacious chamber, twenty feet each way and twelve feet high, and in these noble proportions was written quietly a message of luxurious wellbeing and assurance. In the exact centre of the wall that faced the door stood his bed, a chaste four-poster of the Revolutionary period, and beside it a little table holding a small clock, a few books, and a lamp. In the centre of another wall was an antique chest of drawers, and tastefully arranged about the room were a gate-legged table, with a row of books and the latest magazines upon it, two fine old Windsor chairs, and a comfortable, well-padded east chair. Several charming French prints hung on the walls. On the floor was a thick and heavy carpet of dull grey. These were all the furnishings. The total effect was one of modest and almost austere simplicity, subtly combined with a sense of spaciousness, wealth, and power.",1
3534,"The owner of this room read its message with pleasure, and turned once more to the open window. With fingers pressed against his swelling breast, he breathed in a deep draught of the fresh, living air of morning. It was laden with the thrilling compost of the city, a fragrance delicately blended of many things. There was, strangely, the smell of earth, moist and somehow flowerful, tinged faintly with the salt reek of tidal waters and the fresh river smell, rank and a little rotten, and spiced among these odours was the sultry aroma of strong boiling coffee. This incense-laden air carried a tonic threat of conflict and of danger, and a leaping, winelike prophecy of power, wealth, and love. Mr. Jack breathed in this vital ether slowly, with heady joy, sensing again the unknown menace and delight it always brought to him.",1
3535,"All at once a trembling, faint and instant, passed in the earth below him. He paused, frowning, and an old unquiet feeling to which he could not give a name stirred in his heart. He did not like things to shake and tremble. When he had first come here to live and had awaked at morning thinking he felt a slight vibration in the massive walls around him, a tremor so brief and distant that he could not be certain of it, he had asked a few questions of the doorman who stood at the Park Avenue entrance of the building. The man told him that the great apartment house had been built across two depths of railway tunnels, and that all Mr. Jack had felt was the vibration that came from the passing of a train deep in the bowels of the earth. The man assured him that it was all quite safe, that the very trembling in the walls, in fact, was just another proof of safety.",1
3536,"Still, Mr. Jack did not like it. The news disturbed him vaguely. He would have liked it better if the building had been anchored upon the solid rock. So now, as he felt the slight tremor in the walls once more, he paused, frowned, and waited till it stopped. Then he smiled.",1
3537,"Great trains pass under me,"" he thought. Morning, bright morning, and still they come--all the boys who have dreamed dreams in the little towns. They come for ever to the city. Yes, even now they pass below me, wild with joy, mad with hope, drunk with their thoughts of victory. For what? For what? Glory, huge profits, and a girl! All of them come looking for the same magic wand. Power. Power. Power. Thoroughly awake now, Mr. Jack closed the window and moved briskly across his chamber to the bathroom.'",1
3538,"He liked lavish plumbing, thick with creamy porcelain and polished silver fixtures. For a moment he stood before the deep wash-basin with bared lips, looking at himself in the mirror, and regarding with considerable satisfaction the health and soundness of his strong front teeth. Then he brushed them earnestly with stiff, hard bristles and two inches of firm, thick paste, turning his head from side to side round the brush and glaring at his image in the glass until he foamed agreeably at the mouth with a lather that tasted of fresh mint. This done, he spat it out and let running water wash it down the drain, and then he rinsed his mouth and throat with gently biting antiseptic.",1
3539,"He liked the tidy, crowded array of lotions, cream, unguents, bottles, tubes, jars, brushes, and shaving implements that covered the shelf of thick blue glass above the basin. He lathered his face heavily with a large silver-handled shaving-brush, rubbing the lather in with firm finger-tips, brushing and stroking till his jaws were covered with a smooth, thick layer of warm shaving cream. Then he took the razor in his hand and opened it. He used a straight razor, and he always kept it in excellent condition. At the crucial moment, just before the first long downward stroke, he flourished slightly forward with his plump arms and shoulders, raising the glittering blade aloft in one firm hand, his legs widened stockily, crouching gently at the knees, his lathered face craned carefully to one side and upwards, and his eyes rolled towards the ceiling, as if he were getting braced and ready beneath a heavy burden. Then, holding one cheek delicately between two arched fingers, he advanced deliberately upon it with the gleaming blade. He grunted gently, with satisfaction, at the termination of the stroke. The blade had mown smoothly, leaving a perfect swath of pink, clean flesh across his face from cheek to jowl. He exulted in the slight tug and rasping pull of wiry stubble against the deadly sharpness of the razor, and in the relentless sweep and triumph of the steel.",1
3540,"And while he shaved Mr. Jack occupied his mind with pleasant thoughts of all the good things in his life. He thought about his clothes. Elegant in dress, always excellently correct, he wore fresh garments every day. No cotton touched him. He bought underclothes of the finest silk, and he had more than forty suits from London. Every morning he examined his wardrobe studiously, choosing with care and with a good eye for harmony the shoes, socks, shirt, and necktie he would wear, and before he selected a suit he was sometimes lost in thought for several minutes. He loved to open wide the door of his great closet and see his suits hanging there in rows in all their groomed and regimented elegance. He liked the strong, clean smell of honest cloth, and in those forty several shapes and colours he saw as many pleasing reflections and variations of his own character. They filled him, as did everything about him, with a sense of morning confidence, joy, and vigour.",1
3541,"For breakfast he would have orange juice, two leghorn eggs, soft boiled, two slices of crisp, thin toast, and tasty little segments of pink Praguer ham, which looked so pretty on fresh parsley sprigs. And he would have coffee, strong coffee, cup after cup of it. So fortified, he would face the world with cheerful strength, ready for whatever chance the day might bring him.",1
3542,"The smell of earth which he had caught in the air this morning was good, and the remembrance of it laid a soothing unction on his soul. Although city-bred, Mr. Jack was as sensitive to the charms of Mother Earth as any man alive. He liked the cultivated forms of nature--the swarded lawns of great estates, gay regiments of brilliant garden flowers, and rich masses of clumped shrubbery. All these things delighted him. The call of the simple life had grown stronger every year, and he had built a big country house in Westchester County.",1
3543,"He liked the more expensive forms of sport. He would frequently go out in the country to play golf, and he loved bright sunlight on the rich velvet of the greens and the new-mown smell of fairways. And afterwards, when he had stood below the bracing drive of the shower and had felt the sweat of competition wash cleanly from his well-set form, he liked to loaf upon the cool veranda of the club and talk about his score, joke and laugh, pay or collect his bets, and drink good Scotch with other men of note. And he liked to watch his country's flag flap languidly upon the tall white pole because it looked so pretty there.",1
3544,"Mr. Jack also liked the ruder and more natural forms of beauty. He liked to see tall grasses billowing on a hillside, and he liked old shaded roads that wound away to quietness from driven glares of speed and concrete. He was touched by the cosmic sadness of leafy orange, gold, and russet brown in mid-October, and he had seen the evening light upon the old red of a mill and felt deep stillness in his heart (""all--could anyone believe it?--within thirty miles of New York City""). On those occasions the life of the metropolis had seemed very far away. And often he had paused to pluck a flower or stand beside a brook in thought. But after sighing with regret as, among such scenes, he thought of the haste and folly of man's life, Mr. Jack always came back to the city. For life was real, and life was earnest, and Mr. Jack was a business man.",1
3545,"He was a business man, so of course he liked to gamble. What is business but a gamble? Will prices go up or down? Will Congress do this or that? Will there be war in some far corner of the earth, and a shortage of some essential raw material? What will the ladies wear next year--big hats or little ones, long dresses or short? You make your guess and back it with your money, and if you don't guess right often enough you don't remain a business man. So Mr. Jack liked to gamble, and he gambled like the business man he was. He gambled every day upon the price of stocks. And at night he often gambled at his club. It was no piker's game he played. He never turned a hair about a thousand dollars. Large sums did not appal him. He was not frightened by Amount and Number. That is why he liked great crowds. That is why the beetling cliffs of immense and cruel architectures lapped his soul in strong security. When he saw a ninety-storey building he was not one to fall down grovelling in the dust, and beat a maddened brain with fists, and cry out: ""Woe! 0 woe is me! No. Every cloud-lost spire of masonry was a talisman of power, a monument to the everlasting empire of American business. It made him feel good. For that empire was his faith, his fortune, and his life. He had a fixed place in it.",1
3546,"Yet his neck was not stiff, nor his eye hard. Neither was he very proud. For he had seen the men who lean upon their sills at evening, and those who swarm from rat holes in the ground, and often he had wondered what their lives were like.",1
3547,"Mr. Jack finished shaving and rinsed his glowing face, first with hot water, then with cold. He dried it with a fresh towel, and he rubbed it carefully with a fragrant, gently stinging lotion. This done, he stood for a moment, satisfied, regarding his image, softly caressing the velvet texture of dose-shaved, ruddy cheeks with stroking fingertips. Then he turned briskly away, ready for his bath.",1
3548,"He liked the morning plunge in his great sunken tub, the sensual warmth of sudsy water, and the sharp, aromatic cleanness of the bath salts. He had an eye for aesthetic values, too, and he liked to loll back in the tub and watch the dance of water spangles in their magic shift and play upon the creamy ceiling. Most of all, he liked to come up pink and dripping, streaked liberally with tarry-scented soap, and then he loved the stinging drive and shock of needled spray, the sense of hardihood and bracing conflict, and he liked the glow of abundant health as he stepped forth, draining down upon a thick cork mat, and vigorously rubbed himself dry in the folds of a big, crashy bath towel.",1
3549,"All this he now anticipated eagerly as he let fall with a full thud the heavy silver-headed waste-pipe stopper. He turned the hot-water tap on as far as it would go, and watched a moment as the tumbling water began smokily to fill the tub with its thick boiling gurgle. Then, scuffing the slippers from his feet, he rapidly stripped off his silk pyjamas. He felt with pride the firm-swelling flexor muscle of his upper arm, and observed with keen satisfaction the reflection in the mirror of his plump, well-conditioned body. He was well-moulded and solid-looking, with hardly a trace of unwholesome fat upon him--a little undulance, perhaps, across the kidneys, a mere suggestion of a bay about the waist, but not enough to cause concern, and far less than he had seen on many men twenty years his junior. Content, deep and glowing, filled him. He turned the water off and tested it with a finger, which he jerked back with an exclamation of hurt surprise. In his self-absorption he had forgotten the cold water, so now he turned it on and waited while it seethed with tiny milky bubbles and sent waves of trembling light across the hot blue surface of his bath. At last he tried it with a cautious toe and found it tempered to his liking. He shut the water off.",1
3550,"And now, stepping back a pace or two, he gripped the warm tiling of the floor with his bare toes, straightened up with military smartness, drew in a deep breath, and vigorously began his morning exercises. With stiffened legs he bent strongly towards the floor, grunting as his groping finger-tips just grazed the tiling. Then he swung into punctual rhythms, counting: ""One!--Two!--Three!--Four! as his body moved. And all the time while his arms beat their regular strokes through the air, his thoughts continued to amble down the pleasant groove that his life had worn for them.",1
3551,"To-night was the great party, and he liked the brilliant gaiety of such gatherings. He was a wise man, too, who knew the world and the city well, and, although kind, he was not one to miss the fun of a little harmless byplay, the verbal thrust and parry of the clever ones, or the baiting of young innocents by those who were wily at the game. Something of the sort could usually be counted on when all kinds of people were brought together at these affairs. It gave a spice and zest to things. Some yokel, say, fresh from the rural districts, all hands and legs and awkwardness, hooked and wriggling on a cruel and cunning word--a woman's, preferably, because women were so swift and deft in matters of this nature. But there were men as well whose skill was great--pampered lap-dogs of rich houses, or feisty, nimble-witted little she-men whose mincing tongues were always good for one or two shrewd thrusts of poison in a hayseed's hide. There was something in the face of a fresh-baited country boy as it darkened to a slow, smouldering glow of shame, surprise, and anger and sought with clumsy and inept words to retort upon the wasp which had stung it and winged away--something so touching--that Mr. Jack, when he saw it, felt a sense of almost paternal tenderness for the hapless victim, a delightful sense of youth and innocence in himself. It was almost as if he were revisiting his own youth.",1
3552,"But enough was enough. Mr. Jack was neither a cruel nor an immoderate man. He liked the gay glitter of the night, the thrill and fever of high stakes, and the swift excitements of new pleasures. He liked the theatre and saw all the best plays, and the better, smarter, wittier revues--the ones with sharp, satiric lines, good dancing, and Gershwin music. He liked the shows his wife designed because she designed them, he was proud of her, and he enjoyed those evenings of ripe culture at the Guild. He also went to prize-fights in his evening clothes, and once when he came home he had the red blood of a champion on the white boiled bosom of his shirt. Few men could say as much.",1
3553,"He liked the social swim, and the presence of the better sort of actors, artists, writers, and wealthy, cultivated Jews round his table. He had a kind heart and a loyal nature. His purse was open to a friend in need. He kept a lavish table and a royal cellar, and his family was the apple of his eye.",1
3554,"But he also liked the long velvet backs of lovely women, and the flash of jewellery about their necks. He liked women to be seductive, bright with gold and diamonds to set off the brilliance of their evening gowns. He liked women cut to fashion, with firm breasts, long necks, slender legs, flat hips, and unsuspected depth and undulance. He liked their faces pale, their hair of bronze-gold wire, their red mouths thin, a little cruel, their eyes long, slanting, cat-grey, and lidded carefully. He liked a frosted cocktail shaker in a lady's hands, and he liked a voice hoarse-husky, city-wise, a trifle weary, ironic, faintly insolent, that said:  ""Well!",1
3555,"What happened to you, darling? I thought that You would never get here. He liked all the things that men are fond of.",1
3556,"All of them he had enjoyed himself, each in its proper time and place, and he expected everyone to act as well as he. But ripeness with Mr. Jack was everything, and he always knew the time to stop. His ancient and Hebraic spirit was tempered with a classic sense of moderation. He prized the virtue of decorum highly. He knew the value of the middle way.",1
3557,"He was not a man to wear his heart upon his overcoat, nor risk his life on every corner, nor throw himself away upon a word, nor spend his strength on the impulse of a moment's wild belief. This was such madness as the Gentiles knew. But, this side idolatry and madness he would go as far for friendship's sake as any man. He would go with a friend up to the very edge of ruin and defeat, and he would even try to hold him back. But once he saw a man was mad, and not to be persuaded by calm judgment, he was done with him. He would leave him where he was, although regretfully. Are matters helped if the whole crew drowns together with a single drunken sailor? He thought not. He could put a world of sincere meaning in the three words: ""What a pity!",1
3558,"Yes, Mr. Frederick Tack was kind and temperate. He had found life pleasant, and had won from it the secret of wise living. And the secret of wise living was founded in a graceful compromise, a tolerant acceptance. If a man wanted to live in this world without getting his pockets picked, he had better learn how to use his eyes and ears on what was going on around him. But if he wanted to live in this world without getting hit over the head, and without all the useless pain, grief, terror, and bitterness that mortify human flesh, he had also better learn how not to use his eyes and ears. This may sound difficult, but it had not been so for Mr. Jack. Perhaps some great inheritance of suffering, the long, dark ordeal of his race, had left him, as a precious distillation, this gift of balanced understanding. At any rate, he had not learned it, because it could not be taught: he had been born with it.",1
3559,"Therefore, he was not a man to rip the sheets in darkness or beat his knuckles raw against a wall. He would not madden furiously in the envenomed passages of night, nor would he ever be carried smashed and bloody from the stews. A woman's ways were no doubt hard to bear, but love's bitter mystery had broken no bones for Mr. Jack, and, so far as he was concerned, it could not murder sleep the way an injudicious wiener schitzel could, or that young Gentile fool, drunk again, probably, ringing the telephone at one a.m. to ask to speak to Esther.",1
3560,"Mr. Jack's brow was darkened as he thought of it. He muttered wordlessly. If fools are fools, let them be fools where their folly will not injure or impede the slumbers of a serious man.",1
3561,"Yes, Men could rob, lie, murder, swindle, trick, and cheat--the whole world knew as much. And women--well, they were women, and there was no help for that. Mr. Jack had also known something of the pain and folly that twist the indignant soul of youth--it was too bad, of course, too bad. But regardless of all this, the day was day and men must work, the night was night and men must sleep, and it was, he felt, intolerable----  ""One!""  Red of face, he bent stiffly, with a grunt, until his fingers grazed the rich cream tiling of the bathroom floor.",1
3562,"--intolerable!----  ""Two!""  He straightened sharply, his hands at his sides. --that a man with serious work to do----  ""Three! His arms shot up to full stretching height above his head, and came swiftly down again until he held clenched fists against his breast.",1
3563,"--should be pulled out of his bed in the middle of the night by a crazy young fool!----  ""Four! His closed fists shot outwards in a strong driving movement, and came back to his sides again. --It was intolerable, and, by God, be had half a mind to tell her so!",1
3564,"His exercises ended, Mr. Jack stepped carefully into the luxurious sunken tub and settled his body slowly in its crystal-blue depths. A sigh, long, lingering, full of pleasure, expired upon his lips. 11. Mrs. Jack Awake Mrs. Jack awoke at eight oclock. She awoke like a child, completely alert and alive, instantly awake all over and with all sleep shaken clearly from her mind and senses the moment that she opened her eyes. It had been so with her all her life. For a moment she lay flat on her back and stared straight up at the ceiling.",1
3565,"Then with a vigorous and jubilant movement she flung the covers off of her small and opulent body, which was clothed with a long, sleeveless garment of thin yellow silk. She bent her knees briskly, drew her feet from beneath the covers, and straightened out flat again. She surveyed her small feet with a look of wonder and delight. The sight of her toes in perfect and solid alignment and of their healthy, shining nails filled her with pleasure.",1
3566,"With the same expression of childlike wonder and vanity she slowly lifted her left arm and began to revolve the hand deliberately before her fascinated eyes. She observed with tender concentration how the small and delicate wrist obeyed each command of her will, and she gazed raptly at the graceful, winglike movement of the hand and at the beauty and firm competence that were legible in its brown, narrow back and in the shapely fingers.. Then she lifted the other arm as well, and turned both hands upon their wrists, still gazing at them with a tender concentration of delight.",1
3567,"What magic! she thought. What magic and strength are in them! God, how beautiful they are, and what things they can do! The design for everything I undertake comes out of me in the most wonderful and exciting way. It is all distilled and brewed inside of me--and yet nobody ever asks me how it happens! First, it is all one piece--like something solid in the head,"" she thought comically, now wrinkling her forehead with an almost animal-like expression of bewildered difficulty. Then it all breaks up into little particles, and somehow arranges itself, and then it starts to move! she thought triumphantly. First I can feel it coming down along my neck and shoulders, and then it is moving up across my legs and belly, then it meets and joins together like a star. Then it flows out into my arms until it reaches down into my finger-tips--and then the hand just does what I want it to. It makes a line, and everything I want is in that line. It puts a fold into a piece of cloth, and no one else on earth could put it in that way, or make it look the same. It gives a turn to the spoon, a prod to the fork, a dash of pepper when I cook for George,"" she thought, ""and there's a dish the finest chef on earth could never equal--because it's got me in it, heart and soul and all my love,"" she thought with triumphant joy. Yes! And everything I've ever done has been the same--always the clear design, the line of life, running like a thread of gold all through me back to the time I was a child. Now, having surveyed her deft and beautiful hands, she began deliberately to inspect her other members.",1
3568,"Craning her head downwards, she examined the full outlines of her breasts, and the smooth contours of her stomach, thighs, and legs. She stretched forth her hands and touched them with approval. Then she put her hands down at her sides again and lay motionless, toes evenly in line, limbs straight, head front, eyes staring gravely at the ceiling--a little figure stretched out like a queen for burial, yet still warm, still palpable, immensely calm and beautiful, as she thought:  ""These are my hands and these are my fingers, these are my legs and hips, these are my fine feet and my perfect toes--this is my body.",1
3569,"And suddenly, as if the inventory of these possessions filled her with an immense joy and satisfaction, she sat up with a shining face and placed her feet firmly on the floor. She wriggled into a pair of slippers, stood up, thrust her arms out and brought the hands down again behind her head, yawned, and then put on a yellow quilted dressing-gown which had been lying across the foot of the bed.",1
3570,"Esther had a rosy, jolly, delicate face of noble beauty. It was small, firm, and almost heart-shaped, and in its mobile features there was a strange union of child and woman. The instant anyone met her for the first time he felt: ""This woman must look exactly the way she did when she was a child. She can't have changed at all. Yet her face also bore the markings of middle age. It was when she was talking to someone and her whole countenance was lighted by a merry and eager animation that the child's face was most clearly visible.",1
3571,"When she was at work, her face was likely to have the serious concentration of a mature and expert craftsman engaged in an absorbing and exacting labour, and it was at such time that she looked oldest. It was then that one noticed the somewhat fatigued and minutely wrinkled spaces round her eyes and some strands of grey that were beginning to sprinkle her dark-brown hair. Similarly, in repose, or when she was alone, her face was likely to have a sombre, brooding depth. Its beauty then was profound and full of mystery. She was three parts a Jewess, and in her contemplative moods the ancient, dark, and sorrowful quality of her race seemed to take complete possession of her. She would wrinkle her brow with a look of perpelexity and grief, and in the cast of her features there would be a fatal quality, as of something priceless that was lost and irrecoverable. This look, which she did not wear often, had always troubled George Webber when he saw it because it suggested some secret knowledge buried deep within the woman whom he loved and whom he believed he had come to know.",1
3572,"But the way she appeared most often, and the way people remembered her best, was as a glowing, jolly, indomitably active and eager little creature in whose delicate face the image of the child peered out with joyfulness and immortal confidence. Then her apple-cheeks would glow with health and freshness, and when she came into a room she filled it with her loveliness and gave to everything about her the colour of morning life and innocence. So, too, when she went out on the streets, among the thrusting throngs of desolate and sterile people, her face shone forth like a deathless flower among their dead, grey flesh and dark, dead eyes. They milled past her with their indistinguishable faces set in familiar expressions of inept hardness, betraying cunning without an end, guile without a purpose, cynical knowledge without faith or wisdom, yet even among these hordes of the unburied dead some would halt suddenly in the dreary fury of their existence and would stare at her with their harassed and driven eyes. Her whole figure with its fertile curves, opulent as the earth, belonged to an order of humanity so different from that of their own starved barrenness that they gazed after her like wretches trapped and damned in hell who, for one brief moment, had been granted a vision of living and imperishable beauty.",1
3573,"As Mrs. Jack stood there beside her bed, her maidservant, Nora Fogarty, knocked at the door and entered immediately, bearing a tray with a tall silver coffee-pot, a small bowl of sugar, a cup, saucer, and spoon, and the morning Times. The maid put the tray down on a little table beside the bed, saying in a thick voice:  ""Good maar-nin', Mrs. Jack. Oh, hello, Nora!",1
3574,"the woman answered, crying out in the eager and surprised tone with which she usually responded to a greeting. How are you--hah! she asked, as if she were really greatly concerned, but immediately adding: ""Isn't it going to be a nice day? Did you ever see a more beautiful morning in your life? Oh, beautiful, Mrs. Jack!",1
3575,"Nora answered. Beautiful!""  The maid's voice had a respectful and almost unctuously reverential tone of agreement as she answered, but there was in it an undernote of something sly, furtive, and sullen, and Mrs. Jack looked at her swiftly now and saw the maid's eyes, inflamed with drink and irrationally choleric, staring back at her. Their rancour, however, seemed to be directed not so much at her mistress as at the general family of the earth. Or, if Nora's eyes did swelter with a glare of spite more personal and direct, her resentment was blind and instinctive: it just smouldered in her with an ugly truculence, and she did not know the reason for it. Certainly it was not based on any feeling of class inferiority, for she was Irish, and a papist to the bone, and where social dignities were concerned she thought she knew on which side condescension lay.",1
3576,"She had served Mrs. Jack and her family for more than twenty years, and had grown slothful on their beauty, but in spite of a very affectionate devotion and warmth of old Irish feeling she had never doubted for a moment that they would ultimately go to hell, together with other pagans and all alien heathen tribes whatever. Just the same, she had done pretty well by herself among these prosperous infidels. She had a ""cushy"" job, she always fell heir to the scarcely-worn garments of Mrs. Jack and her sister Edith, and she saw to it that the policeman who came to woo her several times a week should lack for nothing in the way of food and drink to keep him contented and to forestall any desire he might have to stray off and forage in other pastures. Meanwhile, she had laid by several thousand dollars, and had kept her sisters and nieces back in County Cork faithfully furnished with a titillating chronicle (sprinkled with pious interjections of regret and deprecation and appeals to the Virgin to watch over her and guard her among such infidels) of high life in this rich New World that had such pickings in it.",1
3577,"No--decidedly this truculent resentment which smouldered in her eyes had nothing to do with caste. She had lived here for twenty years, enjoying the generous favour of a very good, superior sort of heathen, and growing used to almost all their sinful customs, but she had never let herself forget where the true way and the true light was, nor her hope that she would one day return into the more civilised and Christian precincts of her own kind. Neither did the grievance in the maid's hot eyes come from a sense of poverty, the stubborn, silent anger of the poor against the rich, the feeling of injustice that decent people like herself should have to fetch and carry all their lives for idle, lazy wasters. She was not feeling sorry for herself because she had to drudge with roughened fingers all day long in order that this fine lady might smile rosily and keep beautiful. Nora knew full well that there was no task in all the household range of duties, whether of serving, mending, cooking, cleaning, or repairing, which her mistress could not do far better and with more dispatch than her.",1
3578,"She knew, too, that every day in the great city which roared all about her own dull ears this other woman was going back and forth with the energy of a dynamo, buying, ordering, fitting, cutting, and designing--now on the scaffolds with the painters, beating them at their own business in immense, draughty, and rather dismal rooms where her' designs were wrought out into substance, now sitting cross-legged among great bolts of cloth and plying a needle with a defter finger than any on the flashing hands of the pallid tailors all about her, now searching and prying indefatigably through a dozen gloomy little junk shops until she unearthed triumphantly the exact small ornament which she must have. She was always after her people, always pressing on, formidably but with good humour, keeping the affair in hand and pushing it to its conclusion in spite of the laziness, carelessness, vanity, stupidity, indifference, and faithlessness of those with whom she had to work--painters, actors, scene-shifters, bankers, union bosses, electricians, tailors, costumers, producers, and directors. Upon this whole motley and, for the most part, shabbily inept crew which carried on the crazy and precarious affair known as ""show business"", she enforced the structure, design, and incomparably rich colour of her own life. Nora knew about all this.",1
3579,"The maid had also seen enough of the hard world in which her mistress daily strove and conquered to convince herself that even if she had had any of the immense talent and knowledge that her mistress possessed, she did not have in all her lazy body as much energy, resolution, and power as the other woman carried in the tip of her little finger. And this awareness, so far from arousing any feeling of inferiority in her, only contributed to her self-satisfaction, making her feel that it was Mrs. Jack, not herself, who was really the working woman, and that she--enjoying the same food, the same drink, the same shelter, even the same clothing--would not swap places with her for anything on earth. Yes, the maid knew that she was fortunate and had no cause for complaint; yet her grievance, ugly and perverse, glowered implacably in her inflamed and mutinous eyes. And she could not have found a word or reason for it. But as the two women faced each other no word was needed. The reason for it was printed in their flesh, legible in everything they did. It was not against Mrs. Jack's wealth, authority, and position that the maid's rancour was directed, but against something much more personal and indefinable--against the very tone and quality of the other woman's life. For within the past year there had come over the maid a distempered sense of failure and frustration, an obscure but powerful feeling that her life had somehow gone awry and was growing into sterile and fruitless age without ever having come to any ripeness. She was baffled and tormented by a sense of having missed something splendid and magnificent in life, without knowing at all what it was. But whatever it was, her mistress seemed marvellously somehow to have found it and enjoyed it to the full, and this obvious fact, which she could plainly see but could not define, goaded her almost past endurance.",1
3580,"Both women were about the same age, and so nearly the same size that the maid could wear any of her mistress's garments without alteration. But if they had been creatures from separate planetary systems, if each had been formed by a completely different protoplasm, the contrast between them could not have been more extreme. Nora was not an ill-favoured woman. She had a mass of fairly abundant black hair which she brushed over to the side. Her face, had it not been for the distempered look which drink and her own baffled fury had now given it, would have been pleasant and attractive. There was warmth in it, but there was also a trace of that wild fierceness which belongs to something lawless in nature, at once coarse and delicate, murderous, tender, and savagely ebullient. She still had a trim figure, which wore neatly the well-cut skirt of rough green plaid which her mistress had given her (for, because of her long service, she was recognised as a kind of unofficial captain to the other maids and was usually not required to wear maid's uniform). But where the figure of the mistress was small of bone and fine of line and yet at the same time lavish and seductive, the figure of the maid was, by contrast, almost thick and clumsy-looking. It was the figure of a woman no longer young, fresh, and fertile, but already heavied, thickened, dried, and hardened by the shock, the wear, the weight, and the slow accumulation of intolerable days and merciless years, which take from people everything, and from which there is no escape.",1
3581,"No--no escape, except for her, the maid was thinking bitterly, with a dull feeling of inarticulate outrage, and for her, for her, there was never anything but triumph. For her the years brought nothing but a constantly growing success. And why? Why?  It was here, upon this question, that her spirit halted like a wild beast baffled by a sheer and solid blank of wall.",1
3582,"Had they not both breathed the same air, eaten the same food, been clothed by the same garments, and sheltered by the same roof? Had she not had as much--and as good--of everything as her mistress? Yes--if anything she had had the better of it, for she would not drive herself from morning to night, she thought with contemptuous bitterness, the way her mistress did.",1
3583,"Yet here she stood, baffled and confused, glowering sullenly into the shining face of the other woman's glorious success--and she saw it, she knew it, she felt its outrage, but she had no word to voice her sense of an intolerable wrong. All she knew was that she had been stiffened and thickened by the same years that had given the other woman added grace and suppleness, that her skin had been dried and sallowed by the same lights and weathers that had added lustre to the radiant beauty of the other, and that even now her spirit was soured by her knowledge of ruin and defeat while in the other woman there coursed for ever an exquisite music of power and control, of health and joy. Yes, she saw it plainly enough. The comparison was cruelly and terribly true, past the last atom of hope and disbelief. And as she stood there before her mistress with the weary distemper in her eyes, enforcing by a stern compulsion the qualities of obedience and respect into her voice, she saw, too, that the other woman read the secret of her envy and frustration, and that she pitied her because of it. And for this Nora's soul was filled with hatred, because pity seemed to her the final and intolerable indignity.",1
3584,"In fact, although the kind and jolly look on Mrs. Jack's lovely face had not changed a bit since she had greeted the maid, her eye had observed instantly all the signs of the unwholesome fury that was raging in the woman, and with a strong emotion of pity, wonder, and regret she was thinking:  ""She's been at it again! This is the third time in a week that she's been drinking. I wonder what it is--I wonder what it is that happens to that kind of person. Mrs. Jack did not know clearly what she meant by ""that kind of person"", but she felt momentarily the detached curiosity that a powerful, rich, and decisive character may feel when he pauses for a moment from the brilliant exercise of a talent that has crowned his life with triumphant ease and success almost every step of the way, and notes suddenly, and with surprise, that most of the other people in the world are fumbling blindly and wretchedly about, eking out from day to day the flabby substance of grey lives.",1
3585,"She realised with regret that such people are so utterly lacking in any individual distinction that each seems to be a small particle of some immense and vicious life-stuff rather than a living creature who is able to feel and to inspire love, beauty, joy, passion, pain, and death. With a sense of sudden discovery the mistress was feeling this as she looked at the servant who had lived with her familiarly for almost twenty years, and now for the first time she reflected on the kind of life the other woman might have had. What is it? she kept thinking. What's gone wrong with her? She never used to be this way. It has all happened within the last year. And Nora used to be so pretty, too! she thought, startled by the memory. Why, when she first came to us she was really a very handsome girl. Isn't it a shame,"" she thought indignantly, ""that she should let herself go to seed like this--a girl who's had the chances that she's had! I wonder why she never married. She used to have half a dozen of those big policemen on the string, and now there's only one who still comes faithfully. They were all mad about her, and she could have had her pick of them!""  All at once, as she was looking at the servant with kindly interest, the woman's breath, foul with a stale whisky stench, was blown upon her, and she got suddenly a rank body smell, strong, hairy, female, and unwashed.",1
3586,"She frowned with revulsion, and her face began to burn with a glow of shame, embarrassment, and acute distaste. God, but she stinks! she thought, with a feeling of horror and disgust. You could cut the smell round her with an axe! The nasty things! she thought, now including all the servants in her indictment. I'll bet they never wash--and here they are all day long with nothing to do, and they could at least keep clean! My God! You'd think these people would be so glad to be here in this lovely place with the fine life we've made for them that they would be a little proud of it and try to show that they appreciate it! But no! They're just not good enough! she thought scornfully, and for a moment her fine mouth was disfigured at one corner by an ugly expression.",1
3587,"It was an expression which had in it not only contempt and scorn, but also something almost racial--a quality of arrogance that was too bold and naked, as if it were eager to assert its own superiority. This ugly look rested only for a second, and almost imperceptibly, about the edges of her mouth, and it did not sit well on her lovely face. Then it was gone. But the maid had seen it, and that swift look, with all its implications, had stung and whipped her tortured spirit to a frenzy.",1
3588,"Oh, yes, me fine lady! she was thinking. It's too good fer the likes of us ye are, ain't it? Oh me, yes, an' we're very grand, ain't we? What wit' our fine clothes an' our evenin' gowns an' our forty pairs of hand-made shoes! Jesus, now! Ye'd think she was some kind of centipede to see the different pairs of shoes she's got! An' our silk petticoats an' step-ins that we have made in Paris, now! Yes! That makes us very fine, don't it? It's not as if we ever did a little private monkey-business on the side, like ordinary people, is it? Oh, me, no! We are gathered together wit' a friend fer a little elegant an' high-class entertainment durin' the course of the evenin'! But if it's some poor girl wit'out an extra pair of drawers to her name, it's different, now! It's: 'Oh! you nasty thing! I'm disgusted wit' you!'... Yes! An' there's many a fine lady livin' on Park Avenoo right now who's no better, if the truth was told! That I know! So just take care, me lady, not to give yerself too many airs! she thought with rancorous triumph...  ""Ah! if I told all that I know!",1
3589,"' Nora,' she says, 'if anyone calls when I'm not here, I wish ye'd take the message yerself. Mr. Jack don't like to be disturbed.'... Jesus! From what I've seen there's none of 'em that likes to be disturbed. It's love and let love wit' 'em, no questions ast an' the divil take the hindmost, so long as ye do it in yer leisure hours. But if ye're twenty minutes late fer dinner, it's where the hell have ye been, an' what's to become of us when ye neglect yer family in this way?...Sure,"" she thought, warming with a flush of humour and a more tolerant and liberal spirit, ""it's a queer world, ain't it? An' these are the queerest of the lot! Thank God I was brought up like a Christian in the Holy Church, an' still have grace enough to go to Mass when I have sinned! But then----""  As often happens with people of strong but disordered feelings, she was already sorry for her flare of ugly temper, and her affections were now running warmly in another direction:",1
3590,"But then, God knows, there's not a better-hearted sort of people in the world! There's no one I'd rather work fer than Mrs. Jack. They'll give ye everything they have if they like ye. I've been here twenty years next April, an' in all that time no one has ever been turned away from the door who needed food. Sure, there's far worse that go to Mass seven days a week--yes, an' would steal the pennies off a dead man's eyes if they got the chance! It's a good home we've been given here--as I keep tellin' all the rest of 'em,"" she thought with virtuous content, ""an' Nora Fogarty's not the one to turn an' bite the hand that's feedin' her--no matter what the rest of 'em may do!""  All this had passed in the minds and hearts of the two women with the instancy of thought.",1
3591,"Meanwhile, the maid, having set the tray down on the little table by the bed, had gone to the windows, lowered them, raised the blinds to admit more light, slightly adjusted the curtains, and was now in the bathroom drawing the water in the tub, an activity signalised at first by the rush of tumbling waters, and later by a sound more quiet and sustained as she reduced the flow and tempered the boiling fluid to a moderate heat. While this was going on, Mrs. Jack had seated herself on the edge of her bed, crossed her legs jauntily, poured out a cup of black steaming coffee from the tall silver pot, and opened the newspaper which lay folded on the tray. And now, as she drank her coffee and stared with blank, unseeing eyes at the print before her, there was a perplexed frown on her face, and she was slipping one finger in and out of a curious and ancient ring which she wore on her right hand. It was a habit which she performed unconsciously, and it always indicated a state of impatience and nervousness, or the troubled reflection of a mind that was rapidly collecting itself for a decisive action. So, now, her first emotions of pity, curiosity, and regret having passed, the practical necessity of doing something about Nora was pressing at her.",1
3592,"That's where Fritz's liquor has been going,"" she thought. He's been furious about it... She's got to stop it. If she keeps on at this rate, she'll be no good for anything in another month or two...God! I could kill her for being such a fool! she thought. What gets into these people, anyway? Her small and lovely face now red with anger, the space between her troubled eyes cleft deeply by a frown, she determined to speak plainly and sternly to the maid without any more delay.",1
3593,"This decision being made, she was conscious instantly of a sense of great relief and a feeling almost of happiness, for indecision was alien to the temper of her soul. The knowledge of the maid's delinquency had been nagging at her conscience for some time, and now she wondered why she had ever hesitated. Yet, when the maid came back into the room again and paused before going out, as if waiting for further orders, and looked at her with a glance that now seemed affectionate and warm, Mrs. Jack felt acute embarrassment and regret as she began to speak, and, to her surprise, she found herself beginning in a hesitant and almost apologetic tone.",1
3594,"Oh, Nora!"" she said somewhat excitedly, slipping the ring rapidly on and off her finger. There's something I want to talk to you about. Yes, Mrs. Jack,"" Nora answered humbly, and waited respectfully.",1
3595,"It's something Miss Edith wanted me to ask you,"" she went on quickly, somewhat timidly, discovering to her amazement that she was beginning her reproof quite differently from the way she had intended. Nora waited in an attitude of studious and submissive attention. I wonder if you or any of the other girls remember seeing a dress Miss Edith had,"" she said, and went on quickly--""one of those dresses she brought back last year from Paris. It had a funny grey-green kind of colour and she used to wear it in the morning when she went to business. Do you remember--hah? she said sharply.",1
3596,"Yes, ma'am,"" said Nora with a solemn, wondering air. I've seen it, Mrs. Jack. Well, Nora, she can't find it.",1
3597,"It's gone. Gone?"" said Nora, staring at her with a stupid and astonished look. But even as the servant repeated the word, a furtive smile played round her mouth, betraying her sullen humour, and a look of sly triumph came in her eyes. Mrs. Jack read the signs instantly:  ""Yes!",1
3598,"She knows where it is! she thought. Of course she knows! One of them has taken it! It's perfectly disgraceful, and I'm not going to stand it any longer!""--and a wave of indignation, hot and choking, boiled up in her. Yes, gone! It's gone, I tell you! she said angrily to the staring maid. What's become of it? Where do you think it's gone to? she asked bluntly.",1
3599,"I don't know, Mrs. Jack,"" Nora answered in a slow, wondering tone. Miss Edith must have lost it. Lost it!",1
3600,"Oh, Nora, don't be stupid! she cried furiously. How could she lose it? She's been nowhere. She's been here all the time. And the dress was here, too, hanging in her closet, up to a week ago! How can you lose a dress?"" she cried impatiently. Is it just going to crawl off your back and walk away from you when you're not looking? she said sarcastically. You know she didn't lose it! Someone's taken it!""  ""Yes, ma'am,"" Nora said with dutiful acquiescence.",1
3601,"That's what I think, too. Someone must have sneaked in here when all of yez was out an' taken it. Ah, I tell ye,"" she remarked with a regretful movement of the head, ""it's got so nowadays ye never know who to trust and who not to,"" she observed sententiously. A friend of mine who works fer some big people up at Rye was tellin' me just the other day about a man that came there wit' some kind of a floor-mop he had to sell--ast to try it out an' show 'em how it worked upon their floors, ye know, an' a finer, cleaner-lookin' boy, she says, ye wouldn't see again in yer whole lifetime. 'An' my God! she says-- I'm tellin' ye just the way she told it to me, Mrs. Jack--'I couldn't believe me own ears when they told me later what he'd done! If he'd been me own brother I couldn't have been more surprised!' she says.--Well, it just goes to show ye that----""  ""Oh, Nora, for heaven's sake!",1
3602,"Mrs. Jack cried with an angry and impatient gesture. Don't talk such rot to me! Who would come in here without your knowing it? You girls are here all day long, there's only the elevator and the service entrance, and you see everyone who comes in! And besides, if anyone ever took the trouble to break in, you know he wouldn't stop with just one dress. He'd be after money or jewellery or something valuable that he could sell. Well, now, I tell ye,"" Nora said, ""that man was here last week to fix the refrigerator.",1
3603,"I says to May at the time: 'I don't like the look of him,' I says. 'There's somethin' in his face that I don't like. Keep yer eye on him,' I says, 'because----'""  ""Nora!",1
3604,"At the sharp warning in her mistress's voice the maid stopped suddenly, looked quickly at her, and then was silent, with a dull flush of shame and truculence upon her face. Mrs. Jack stared back at her with a look of burning indignation, then she burst out with open, blazing anger. Look here! Mrs. Jack cried furiously. I think it's a dirty shame the way you girls are acting! We've been good to you! Nora,"" and now her voice grew gentler with pity, ""there are no girls in this town who've been better treated than you have. Don't I know it, Mrs. Jack,"" Nora answered in a lilting and earnest tone, but her eyes were sullenly hostile and resentful.",1
3605,"Haven't I always said the same? Wasn't I sayin' the same thing meself to Janie just the other day? 'Sure,' I says, 'but we're the lucky ones! There's no one in the world I'd rather work fer than Mrs. Jack. Twenty years,' I says, 'I've been here, an' in all that time,' I says, 'I've never heard a cross word from her. They're the best people in the world,' I says, 'an' any girl that gets a job wit' 'em is lucky!' Sure, don't I know all of ye""--she cried richly--""Mr. Jack an' Miss Edith an' Miss Alma? Wouldn't I get down on me knees right now an' scrub me fingers to the bone if it would help ye any?""  ""Who's asking you to scrub your fingers to the bone?",1
3606,"Mrs. Jack cried impatiently. Lord, Nora, you girls have it pretty soft. There's mighty little scrubbing that you've had to do! she said. It's the rest of us who scrub! she cried. We go out of here every morning--six days in the week--and work like hell----""  ""Don't I know it, Mrs. Jack?",1
3607,"Nora broke in. Wasn't I sayin' to May just the other day----""  ""Oh, damn what you said to May! For a brief moment Mrs. Jack looked at the servant with a straight, burning face. Then she spoke more quietly to her. Nora, listen to me,"" she said. We've always given you girls everything you ever asked for. You've had the best wages anyone can get for what you do. And you've lived here with us just the same as the rest of us, for you know very well that----""  ""Sure,"" Nora interrupted in a richly sentimental tone.",1
3608,"It hasn't been like I was workin' here at all! Ye couldn't have treated me any better if I'd been one of the family! Oh, one of the family my eye! Mrs. Jack said impatiently. Don't make me laugh! There's no one in the family--unless maybe it's my daughter, Alma--who doesn't do more in a day than you girls do in a week! You've lived the life of Riley...here! The life of Riley! she repeated, almost comically, and then she sat looking at the servant for a moment, a formidable little dynamo trembling with her indignation, slowly clenching and unclenching her small hands at her sides. Good heavens, Nora! she burst out in a furious tone. It's not as if we ever begrudged you anything! We've never denied you anything you asked for! It's not the value of the dress! You know very well that Miss Edith would have given it to any one of you if you had gone to her and asked her for it! But--oh, it's intolerable!--intolerable! she exclaimed suddenly in uncontrollable anger--""that you should have no more sense or decency than to do a thing like that to people who have always been your friends!""  ""Sure, an' do ye think I'd be the one who'd do a thing like that?"" cried Nora in a trembling voice.",1
3609,"Is it me ye're accusin', Mrs. Jack, when I've lived here wit' yez all this time? They could take me right hand""--in her rush of feeling she held the member up--""an' chop it from me arm before I'd take a button that belonged to one of yez. An' that's God's truth,"" she added solemnly. I swear it to ye as I hope to live an' be forgiven fer me sins! she declared more passionately as her mistress started to speak. I never took a pin or penny that belonged to any one of yez--an' so help me God, that's true! An' yes! I'll swear it to ye be everything that's holy! she now cried, tranced in a kind of ecstasy of sacred vows. By the soul an' spirit of me blessed mother who is dead----""  ""Ah, Nora!",1
3610,"Mrs. Jack said pityingly, shaking her head and turning away, and, in spite of her indignation, breaking into a short laugh at the extravagance of the servant's oaths. And she thought with a bitter, scornful humour: ""God! You can't talk to her! She'll swear a thousand oaths and think that makes everything all right! Yes! and will drink Fritz's whisky and go to Mass if she has to crawl to get there--and cross herself with holy water--and listen to the priest say words she cannot understand--and come out glorified--to act like this when she knows that one of the girl's is taking things that don't belong to her! What strange and magic things these oaths and ceremonies are! she thought. They give a kind of life to people who have none of their own. They make a kind of truth for people who have found none for themselves. Love, beauty, everlasting truth, salvation--all that we hope and suffer for on earth is in them for these people. Everything that the rest of us have to get with our blood and labour, and by the anguish of our souls, is miraculously accomplished for them, somehow,"" she thought ironically, ""if they can only swear to it 'by the soul an' spirit of me blessed mother who is dead.' --An' so help me God, by all the Blessed Saints, an' by the Holy Virgin, too!",1
3611,"she heard Nora's voice intoning; and, wearily, she turned to the maid again and spoke to her softly, with an almost pleading earnestness:  ""Nora, for God's sake have a little sense,"" she said. What is the use of all this swearing by the Virgin and the Saints, and getting up and going out to Mass, when all you do is come back home to swill down Mr. Jack's whisky? Yes, and deceive the people who have been the best friends you ever had! she cried out bitterly. Then, seeing the old mutinous look flaring again in the maid's sullen and distempered eyes, she went on almost tearfully: ""Nora, try to have a little wisdom. Is this all you've been able to get from life--to come in here and act this way and blow your stinking breath on me, when all we've ever done has been to help you? Her voice was trembling with her pity and her sense of passionate outrage, yet her anger was more than personal. She felt that the maid had betrayed something decent and inviolable in life--a faith and integrity in human feeling that should be kept and \honoured everywhere.",1
3612,"Well, ma'am,"" said Nora with a toss of her black head, ""as I was sayin', if it's me ye're accusing'----""  ""No, Nora. Enough of that. Mrs. Jack's voice was sad, tired, dispirited, but its tone was also firm and final. She made a little dismissing gesture with her hand. You may go now. I don't need anything more. The maid marched to the door, her head held high, her stiff back and neck eloquently expressive of outraged innocence and suppressed fury.",1
3613,"Then she paused, her hand upon the knob, and half-turned as she delivered her parting shot. About Miss Edith's dress""--she said with another toss of her head--""if it's not lost, I guess it'll turn up. Maybe one of the girls borrowed it, if ye know what I mean. With this, she closed the door behind her and was gone.",1
3614,"Half an hour later Mr. Frederick Jack came walking down the hall with his copy of the Herald-Tribune under his arm. He was feeling in very good humour. By now he had completely forgotten his momentary annoyance at the telephone call that had awakened him in the middle of the night. He rapped lightly at his wife's door and waited. There was no answer. More faintly, listening, he rapped again.",1
3615,"Are you there?"" he said. He opened the door and entered noiselessly. She was already deeply absorbed in the first task of her day's work. On the other side of the room, with her back to him, she was seated at a small writing-desk between the windows with a little stack of bills, business letters, and personal correspondence on her left hand, and an open cheque-book on her right. She was vigorously scrawling off a note. As he advanced towards her she put down the pen, swiftly blotted the paper, and was preparing to fold it and thrust it in an envelope when he spoke.",1
3616,"Good morning,"" he said in the pleasant, half-ironic tone that people use when they address someone who is not aware of their presence. She jumped and turned round quickly. Oh, hello, Fritz!"" she cried in her jolly voice. How are youhah?""  He stooped in a somewhat formal fashion, planted a brief, friendly, and perfunctory kiss on her cheek, and straightened up, unconsciously shrugging his shoulders a little, and giving his sleeves and the bottom of his coat a tug to smooth out any wrinkle that might have appeared to disturb the faultless correctness of his appearance.",1
3617,"While his wife's quick glance took in every detail of his costume for the day--his shoes, socks, trousers, coat, and tie, together with the perfection of his tailored form and the neat gardenia in his buttonhole--her face, now bent forward and held firmly in one cupped hand in an attitude of eager attentiveness, had a puzzled and good-natured look which seemed to say: ""I can see that you are laughing at me about something. What have I done now? Mr. Jack stood before her, feet apart and arms akimbo, regarding her with an expression of mock gravity, in which, however, his good humour and elation were apparent.",1
3618,"Well, what is it? she cried excitedly. In answer, Mr. Jack produced the newspaper which he had been holding folded back in one hand, and tapped it with his index finger, saying:  ""Have you seen this?""  ""No.",1
3619,"Who is it?""  ""It's Elliot in the Herald-Tribune. Like to hear it?""  ""Yes. Read it. What does he say?""  Mr. Jack struck a pose, rattled the paper, frowned, cleared his throat in mock solemnity, and then began in a slightly ironic and affected tone, intended to conceal his own deep pleasure and satisfaction, to read the review.",1
3620,"'Mr. Shulberg has brought to this, his latest production, the full artillery of his distinguished gifts for suave direction. He has paced it brilliantly, timed it--word, scene, and gesture--with some of the most subtly nuanced, deftly restrained, and quietly persuasive acting that this season has yet seen. He has a gift for silence that is eloquent--oh, devoutly eloquent!--among all the loud but for the most part meaningless vociferation of the current stage. All this your diligent observer is privileged to repeat with more than customary elation. Moreover, Mr. Shulberg has revealed to us in the person of Montgomery Mortimer the finest youthful talent that this season has discovered. Finally----'""  Mr. Jack cleared his throat solemnly--""Ahem, ahem!""--flourished his arms forward and rattled the paper expressively, and stared drolly at his wife over the top of it.",1
3621,"Then he went on:  ""'Finally, he has given us, with the distinguished aid of Miss Esther Jack, a faultless and unobtrusive décor which warmed these ancient bones as they have not been warmed for many a Broadway moon. In these three acts, Miss Jack contributes three of the most effective settings she has ever done for the stage. Hers is a talent that needs make obeisance to no one. She is, in fact, in the studied opinion of this humble but diligent observer, the first designer of her time.' Mr. Jack paused abruptly, looked at her with playful gravity, his head cocked over the edges of the paper and said: ""Did you say something?""  ""God!",1
3622,"she yelled, her happy face flushed with laughter and excitement. Did you hear it? Vat is dees? she said comically, making a Jewish gesture with her hands--""an ovation?--What else does he say--hah? she asked, bending forward eagerly.",1
3623,"Mr. Jack proceeded:  ""'It is therefore a pity that Miss Jack's brilliant talent should not have had better fare to feed on than was given it last evening at the Arlington. For the play itself, we must reluctantly admit, was neither----'""  ""Well,"" said Mr. Jack, stopping abruptly and putting down the paper, ""the rest of it is you know""--he shrugged slightly--""sort of soso. Neither good nor bad. He sort of pans it.--But say! he cried, with jocular indignation. I like the nerve of that guy! Where does he get this Miss Esther Jack stuff? Where do I come in?"" he said. Don't I get any credit at all for being your husband? You know,"" he said, ""I'd like to get in somewhere if it's only a seat in the second balcony. Of course""--and now he began to speak in the impersonal manner that people often use when they are being heavily sarcastic, addressing himself to the vacant air as if some invisible auditor were there, and as if he himself were only a detached observer--""of course, he's nothing but her husband, anyway. What is he? Bah! he said scornfully and contemptuously. Nothing but a business man who doesn't deserve to have such a brilliant woman for his wife! What does be know about art? Can he appreciate her? Can he understand anything she does? Can he say--what is it this fellow says? he demanded, suddenly looking at the paper with an intent stare and then reading from it again in an affected tone--""'a faultless and unobtrusive décor which warmed these ancient bones as they have not been warmed for many a Broadway moon.' I know,"" she said with pitying contempt, as if the florid words of the reviewer aroused in her no other emotion, although the pleasure which the reviewer's praise had given her was still legible in her face.",1
3624,"I know. Isn't it pathetic? They're all so fancy, these fellows! They make me tired!""  ""'Hers is a talent that needs make obeisance to no one,'"" Mr. Jack continued.",1
3625,"Now that's a good one! Could her husband think of a thing like that? No!"" he cried suddenly, shaking his head with a scornful laugh and waving a plump forefinger sideways before him. Her husband is not smart enough! he cried. He is not good enough! He's nothing but a business man! He can't appreciate her!""--and all at once, to her amazement, she saw that his eyes were shot with tears, and that the lenses of his spectacles were being covered with a film of mist.",1
3626,"She stared at him wonderingly, her face bent towards him in an expression of startled and protesting concern, but at the same moment she was feeling, as she had often felt; that there was something obscure and strange in life which she had never been able to find out about or to express. For she knew that this unexpected and reasonless display of strong feeling in her husband bore no relation whatever to the review in the paper. His chagrin at having the reviewer refer to her as ""Miss"" was nothing more than a playful and jocular pretence. She knew that he was really bursting with elation because of her success.",1
3627,"With a sudden poignant and wordless pity--for whom, for what, she could not say--she had an instant picture of the great chasms downtown where he would spend his day, and where, in the furious drive and turmoil of his business, excited, prosperous-looking men would seize his arm or clap him on the back and shout:  ""Say, have you seen to-day's Herald-Tribune? Did you read what it had to say about your wife? Aren't you proud of her? Congratulations! She could also see his ruddy face beginning to blush and burn brick-red with pleasure as he received these tributes, and as he tried to answer them with an amused and tolerant smile, and a few casual words of acknowledgment as if to say:  ""Yes, I think I did see some mention of her.",1
3628,"But of course you can hardly expect me to be excited by a thing like that. That's an old story to us now. They've said that kind of thing so often that we're used to it. When he came home that night he would repeat all that had been said to him, and although he would do it with an air of faintly cynical amusement, she knew that his satisfaction would be immense and solid.",1
3629,"She knew, too, that his pride would be enhanced by the knowledge that the wives of these rich men--handsome Jewesses most of them, as material-minded in their quest for what was fashionable in the world of art as were their husbands for what was profitable in the world of business--would also read of her success, would straightway go to witness it themselves, and then would speak of it in brilliant chambers of the night, where the glowing air would take on an added spice of something exciting and erotic from their handsome and sensual-looking faces. All this she thought of instantly as she stared at this plump, grey-haired, and faultlessly groomed man whose eyes had suddenly, and for no reason that she knew, filled with tears, and whose mouth now had the pouting, wounded look of a hurt child. And her heart was filled with a nameless and undefinable sense of compassion as she cried warmly, in a protesting voice:",1
3630,"But, Fritz! You know I never felt like that! You know I never said a thing like that to you! You know I love it when you like anything I do! I'd rather have your opinion ten times over than that of these newspaper fellows! What do they know anyway? she muttered scornfully.",1
3631,"Mr. Jack, having taken off his glasses and polished them, having blown his nose vigorously and put his glasses on again, now lowered his head, braced his thumb stiffly on his temple and put four plump fingers across his eyes in a comical shielding position, saying rapidly in a muffled, apologetic voice:  ""I know! I know! It's all right! I was only joking,"" he said with an embarrassed smile. Then he blew his nose vigorously again, his face lost its expression of wounded feeling, and he began to talk in a completely natural, matter-of-fact tone, as if nothing he had done or said had been at all unusual. Well,"" he said, ""how do you feel? Are you pleased with the way things went last night? Oh, I suppose so,"" she answered dubiously, feeling all at once the vague discontent that was customary with her when her work was finished and the almost hysterical tension of the last days before a theatrical opening was at an end.",1
3632,"Then she continued: ""I think it went off pretty well, don't you? I thought my sets were sort of good--or did you think so? she asked eagerly. No,"" she went on in the disparaging tone of a child talking to itself, ""I guess they were just ordinary. A long way from my best--hah?"" she demanded.",1
3633,"You know what I think,"" he said. I've told you. There's no one who can touch you. The best thing in the show! he said strongly. They were by far the best thing in the show--by far! by far! Then, quietly, he added: ""Well, I suppose you're glad it's over. That's the end of it for this season, isn't it?""  ""Yes,"" she said, ""except for some costumes that I promised Irene Morgenstein I'd do for one of her ballets.",1
3634,"And I've got to meet some of the Arlington company for fittings again this morning,"" she concluded in a dispirited tone. What, again! Weren't you satisfied with the way they looked last night? What's the trouble?""  ""Oh""--she said with disgust--""what do you think's the trouble, Fritz?",1
3635,"There's only one trouble! It never changes! It's always the same! The trouble is that there are so many half-baked fools in the world who'll never do the thing you tell them to do! That's the trouble! God! she said frankly, ""I'm too good for it! I never should have given up my painting. It makes me sick sometimes! she burst out with warm indignation. Isn't it a shame that everything I do has to be wasted on those people? What people?""  ""Oh, you know,"" she muttered, ""the kind of people that you get in the theatre.",1
3636,"Of course there are some good ones--but God! she exclaimed, ""most of them are such trash! Did you see me in this, and did you read what they said about me in that, and wasn't I a knockout in the other thing? she muttered resentfully. God, Fritz, to listen to the way they talk you'd think the only reason a play ever gets produced is to give them a chance to strut around and show themselves off upon a stage! When it ought to be the most wonderful thing in the world! Oh, the magic you can make, the things you can do with people if you want to! It's like nothing else on earth! she cried. Isn't it a shame no more is done with it? She was silent for a moment; sunk in her own thoughts, then she said wearily:",1
3637,"Well, I'm glad this job's at an end. I wish there was something else I could do. If I only knew how to do something else, I'd do it. Really, I would,"" she said earnestly. I'm tired of it. I'm too good for it,"" she said simply, and for a moment she stared moodily into space.",1
3638,"Then, frowning in a sombre and perturbed way, she fumbled in a wooden box upon the desk, took from it a cigarette, and lighted it. She got up nervously and began to walk about the room with short steps, frowning intently while she puffed at the cigarette, and holding it in the rather clumsy but charming manner of a woman who rarely smokes. I wonder if I'll get any more shows to do next season,"" she muttered half to herself, as if scarcely aware of her husband's presence. I wonder if there'll be anything more for me. No one has spoken to me yet,"" she said gloomily.",1
3639,"Well, if you're so tired of it, I shouldn't think you'd care,"" he said ironically, and then added: ""Why worry about it till the time comes?""  With that he stooped and planted another friendly and perfunctory kiss on her cheek, gave her shoulder a gentle little pat, and turned and left the room. 12. Downtown Mr. Jack had listened to his wife's complaint with the serious attention which stories of her labours, trials, and adventures in the theatre always aroused in him. For, in addition to the immense pride which he took in his wife's talent and success, he was like most rich men of his race, and particularly those who were living every day, as he was, in the glamorous, unreal, and fantastic world of speculation, strongly attracted by the glitter of the theatre.",1
3640,"The progress of his career during the forty years since he first came to New York had been away from the quieter, more traditional, and, as it now seemed to him, duller forms of social and domestic life, to those forms which were more brilliant and gay, filled with the constant excitement of new pleasures and sensations, and touched with a spice of uncertainty and menace. The life of his boyhood--that of his family, who for a hundred years had carried on a private banking business in a little town--now seemed to him impossibly stodgy. Not only its domestic and social activities, which went on as steadily and predictably as a clock from year to year, marked at punctual intervals by a ritual of dutiful visits and countervisits among relatives, but its business enterprise also, with its small and cautious transactions, now seemed paltry and uninteresting.",1
3641,"In New York he had moved on from speed to speed and from height to height, keeping pace with all the most magnificent developments in the furious city that roared in constantly increasing crescendo about him. Now, even in the world in which he lived by day, the feverish air of which he breathed into his lungs exultantly, there was a glittering, inflamed quality that was not unlike that of the night-time world of the theatre in which the actors lived. At nine o'clock in the morning of every working day, Mr. Jack was hurled downtown to his office in a shining projectile of machinery, driven by a chauffeur who was a literal embodiment of New York in one of its most familiar aspects. As the driver prowled above his wheel, his dark and sallow face twisted bitterly by the sneer of his thin mouth, his dark eyes shining with an unnatural lustre like those of a man who is under the stimulation of a powerful drug, he seemed to be--and was--a creature which this furious city had created for its special uses. His tallowy flesh seemed to have been compacted, like that of millions of other men who wore grey hats and had faces of the same lifeless hue, out of a common city-substance--the universal grey stuff of pavements, buildings, towers, tunnels, and bridges. In his veins there seemed to flow and throb, instead of blood, the crackling electric current by which the whole city moved. It was legible in every act and gesture the man made. As his sinister figure prowled above the wheel, his eyes darting right and left, his hands guiding the powerful machine with skill and precision, grazing, cutting, flanking, shifting, insinuating, sneaking, and shooting the great car through all but impossible channels with murderous recklessness, it was evident that the unwholesome chemistry that raced in him was consonant with the great energy that was pulsing through all the arteries of the city.",1
3642,"Yet, to be driven downtown by this creature in this way seemed to increase Mr. Jack's anticipation and pleasure in the day's work that lay before him. He liked to sit beside his driver and watch him. The fellow's eyes were now sly and cunning as a cat's, now hard and black as basalt. His thin face pivoted swiftly right and left, now leering with crafty triumph as he snaked his car ahead round some cursing rival, now from the twisted corner of his mouth snarling out his hate loudly at other drivers or at careless pedestrians: ""Guh-wan, ya screwy bast-ed! Guh-wan! He would growl more softly at the menacing figure of some hated policeman, or would speak to his master out of the corner of his bitter mouth, saying a few words of grudging praise for some policeman who had granted him privileges:  ""Some of dem are all right,"" he would say.",1
3643,"You know!""--with a constricted accent of his high, strained voice. Dey're not all basteds. Dis guy""--with a jerk of his head towards the policeman who had nodded and let him pass--""dis guy's all right. I know him--sure! sure!--he's a bruddeh of me sisteh-in-law! The unnatural and unwholesome energy of his driver evoked in his master's mind an image of the world he lived in that was theatrical and phantasmal.",1
3644,"Instead of seeing himself as one man going to his work like countless others in the practical and homely light of day, he saw himself and his driver as two cunning and powerful men pitted triumphantly against the world; and the monstrous architecture of the city, the phantasmagoric chaos of its traffic, the web of the streets swarming with people, became for him nothing more than a tremendous backdrop for his own activities. All of this--the sense of menace, conflict, cunning, power, stealth, and victory, and, above everything else, the sense of privilege--added to Mr. Jack's pleasure, and even gave him a heady joy as he rode downtown to work. And the feverish world of speculation in which he worked, and which had now come to have this theatrical cast and colour, was everywhere sustained by this same sense of privilege. It was the privilege of men selected from the common run because of some mysterious intuition they were supposed to have--selected to live gloriously without labour or production, their profits mounting incredibly with every ticking of the clock, their wealth increased fabulously by a mere nod of the head or the shifting of a finger. This being so, it seemed to Mr. Jack, and, indeed, to many others at the time--for many who were not themselves members of this fortunate class envied those who were--it seemed, then, not only entirely reasonable but even natural that the whole structure of society from top to bottom should be honeycombed with privilege and dishonesty.",1
3645,"Mr. Jack knew, for example, that one of his chauffeurs swindled him constantly. He knew that every bill for petrol, oil, tyres, and overhauling was padded, that the chauffeur was in collusion with the garage owner for this purpose, and that he received a handsome percentage from him as a reward. Yet this knowledge did not disturb Mr. Jack. He actually got from it a degree of cynical amusement. Well aware of what was going on, he also knew that he could afford it, and somehow this gave him a sense of power and security. If he ever entertained any other attitude, it was to shrug his shoulders indifferently as he thought:",1
3646,"Well, what of it? There's nothing to be done about it. They all do it. If it wasn't this fellow, it would be someone else. Similarly, he knew that some of the maids in his household were not above ""borrowing"" things and ""forgetting"" to return them.",1
3647,"He was aware that various members of the police force as well as several red-necked firemen spent most of their hours of ease in his kitchen or in the maids' sitting-room. He also knew that these guardians of the public peace and safety ate royally every night of the choicest dishes of his own table, and that their wants were cared for even before his family and his guests were served, and that his best whisky and his rarest wines were theirs for the taking. But beyond an occasional burst of annoyance when he discovered that a case of real Irish whisky (with rusty sea-stained markings on the bottles to prove genuineness) had melted away almost overnight, a loss which roused his temper only because of the rareness of the thing lost, he said very little. When his wife spoke to him about such matters, as she occasionally did, in a tone of vague protest, saying: ""Fritz, I'm sure those girls are taking things they have no right to. I think it's perfectly dreadful, don't you? What do you think we ought to do about it?""--his usual answer was to smile tolerantly, shrug, and show his palms.",1
3648,"It cost him a great deal of money to keep his family provided with shelter, clothing, service, food, and entertainment, but the fact that a considerable part of it was wasted or actually filched from him by his retainers caused him no distress whatever. All of this was so much of a piece with what went on every day in big business and high finance that he hardly gave it a thought. And his indifference was not the bravado of a man who felt that his world was trembling on the brink of certain ruin and who was recklessly making merry while he waited for the collapse. Quite the contrary. He gave tolerant consent to the extravagance and special privilege of those who were dependent on his bounty, not because he doubted, but because he felt secure. He was convinced that the fabric of his world was woven from threads of steel, and that the towering pyramid of speculation would not only endure, but would grow constantly greater. Therefore the defections of his servants were mere peccadillos, and didn't matter.",1
3649,"In all these ways Mr. Frederick Jack was not essentially different from ten thousand other men of his class and position. In that time and place he would have been peculiar if these things had not been true of him. For these men were all the victims of an occupational disease--a kind of mass hypnosis that denied to them the evidence of their senses. It was a monstrous and ironic fact that the very men who had created this world in which every value was false and theatrical saw themselves, not as creatures tranced by fatal illusions, but rather as the most knowing, practical, and hard-headed men alive. They did not think of themselves as gamblers, obsessed by their own fictions of speculation, but as brilliant executives of great affairs who at every moment of the day ""had their fingers on the pulse of the nation. So when they looked about them and saw everywhere nothing but the myriad shapes of privilege, dishonesty, and self-interest, they were convinced that this was inevitably ""the way things are"".",1
3650,"It was generally assumed that every man had his price, just as every woman had hers. And if, in any discussion of conduct, it was suggested to one of these hard-headed, practical men that So-and-So had acted as he did for motives other than those of total self-interest and calculating desire, that he had done thus and so because he would rather endure pain himself than cause it to others whom he loved, or was loyal because of loyalty, or could not be bought or sold for no other reason than the integrity of his own character--the answer of the knowing one would be to smile politely but cynically, shrug it off, and say:  ""All right. But I thought you were going to be intelligent. Let's talk of something else that we both understand. Such men could not realise that their own vision of human nature was distorted.",1
3651,"They prided themselves on their ""hardness"" and fortitude and intelligence, which had enabled them to accept so black a picture of the earth with such easy tolerance. It was not until a little later that the real substance of their ""hardness"" and intelligence was demonstrated to them in terms which they could grasp. When the bubble of their unreal world suddenly exploded before their eyes, many of them were so little capable of facing harsh reality and truth that they blew their brains out or threw themselves from the high windows of their offices into the streets below. And of those who faced it and saw it through, many a one who had been plump, immaculate, and assured now shrank and withered into premature and palsied senility.",1
3652,"All that, however, was still in the future. It was very imminent, but they did not know it, for they had trained themselves to deny the evidence of their senses. In that mid-October of 1929 nothing could exceed their satisfaction and assurance. They looked about them and, like an actor, saw with their eyes that all was false, but since they had schooled themselves to accept falseness as normal and natural, the discovery only enhanced their pleasure in life.",1
3653,"The choicest stories which these men told each other had to do with some facet of human chicanery, treachery, and dishonesty. They delighted to match anecdotes concerning the delightful knaveries of their chauffeurs, maids, cooks, and bootleggers, telling of the way these people cheated them as one would describe the antics of a household pet. Such stories also had a great success at the dinner-table. The ladies would listen with mirth which they made an impressive show of trying to control, and at the conclusion of the tale they would say: ""I--think--that--is--simp-ly--price-less! (uttered slowly and deliberately, as if the humour of the story was almost beyond belief), or: ""Isn't it in-cred-ible! (spoken with a faint rising scream of laughter), or: ""Stop! You know he didn't! (delivered with a ladylike shriek). They used all the fashionable and stereotyped phrases of people ""responding"" to an ""amusing"" anecdote, for their lives had become so sterile and savourless that laughter had gone out of them.",1
3654,"Mr. Jack had a story of his own, and he told it so well and so frequently that it went the rounds of all the best dinner-tables in New York. A few years before, when he was still living in the old brownstone house on the West Side, his wife was giving one of the open-house patties which she gave every year to the members of the ""group"" theatre for which she worked. At the height of the gaiety, when the party was in full swing and the actors were swarming through the rooms, gorging themselves to their heart's content on the bountiful food and drink, there was suddenly a great screaming of police sirens in the neighbourhood, and the sound of motors driven to their limit and approaching at top speed. The sirens turned into the street, and to the alarm of Mr. Jack and his guests, who now came crowding to the windows, a high-powered truck flanked by two motor-cycle policemen pulled up before the house and stopped. Immediately, the two policemen, whom Mr. Jack instantly recognised as friends of his maids, sprang to the ground, and in a moment more, with the assistance of several of their fellows who got out of the truck, they had lifted a great barrel from the truck and were solemnly rolling it across the pavement and up the stone steps into the house. This barrel, it turned out, was filled with beer. The police were contributing it to the party, to which they had been invited (for when the Jacks gave a party to their friends, the maids and cooks were also allowed to give a party to the policemen and firemen in the kitchen). Mr. Jack, moved by this act of friendship and generosity on the part of the police, desired to pay them for the trouble and expense the beer had cost them, but one of the policemen said to him:  ""Forget about it, boss.",1
3655,"It's O.K. I tell you how it is,"" he then said, lowering his voice to a tone of quiet and confidential intimacy. Dis stuff don't cost us nuttin', see? Nah! he vigorously declared. It's given to us. Sure! It's a commission dey give us,"" he added delicately, ""for seein' dat dere stuff goes troo O.K. See?""  Mr. Jack saw, and he told the story many times.",1
3656,"For he was really a good and generous man, and an act like this, even when it came from those who had drunk royally at his expense for years and had consumed the value of a hundred barrels of beer, warmed and delighted him. Thus, while he could not escape sharing the theatrical and false view of life which was prevalent everywhere about him, he had, along with that, as kind and liberal a spirit as one was likely to meet in the course of a day's journey. Of this there was constant and repeated evidence. He would act instantly to help people in distress, and he did it again and again--for actors down on their luck, for elderly spinsters with schemes for the renovation of the stage that were never profitable, for friends, relatives, and superannuated domestics. In addition to this, he was a loving and indulgent father, lavishing gifts upon his only child with a prodigal hand.",1
3657,"And, strangely, for one who lived among all the constantly shifting visages of a feverish and unstable world, he had always held with tenacious devotion to one of the ancient traditions of his race--a belief in the sacred and inviolable stability of the family. Through this devotion, in spite of the sensational tempo of city life with its menace to every kind of security, he had managed to keep his family together. And this was really the strongest bond which now connected him with his wife. They had long since agreed to live their own individual lives, but they had joined together in a common effort to maintain the unity of their family. And they had succeeded. For this reason and on this ground Mr. Jack respected and had a real affection for his wife.",1
3658,"Such was the well-groomed man who was delivered to his place of business every morning by his speed-drunk and city-hardened chauffeur. And within a hundred yards of the place where he alighted from his car ten thousand other men much like him in dress and style, in their general beliefs, and even, perhaps, in kindness, mercy, and tolerance, were also descending from their thunderbolts and were moving into another day of legend, smoke, and fury. Having been set down at their doors, they were shot up in swift elevators to offices in the clouds. There they bought, sold, and traded in an atmosphere fraught with frantic madness. This madness was everywhere about them all day long, and they themselves were aware of it. Oh, yes, they sensed it well enough. Yet they said nothing. For it was one of the qualities of this time that men should see and feel the madness all round them and never mention it--never admit it even to themselves.",1
3659,"13. Service Entrance The great apartment house in which the Jacks lived was not one of those structures which give to the Island of Manhattan its startling and fabulous quality--those cloud-soaring spires whose dizzy vertices and clifflike façades seem to belong to the sky rather than to the earth. These are the special shapes which flash in the mind of a European when he thinks about New York, and which in-bound travellers, looking from a liner's deck, see in all their appalling and inhuman loveliness sustained there lightly on the water. This building was none of these.",1
3660,"It was--just a building. It was not beautiful, certainly, but it was impressive because of its bulk, its squareness, its sheer mass. From the outside, it seemed to be a gigantic cube of city-weathered brick and stone, punctured evenly by its many windows. It filled an entire block, going through one street to the next.",1
3661,"When one entered it, however, one saw that it had been built in the form of a hollow square about a large central court. This court was laid out on two levels. The lower and middle part was covered with loose gravel, and raised above this level was a terrace for flower-beds, with a broad brick pavement flanking it on all four sides. Beyond the walk there was a span of arches which also ran the whole way round the square, giving the place something of the appearance of an enormous cloister. Leading off this cloister at regular intervals were the entrances to the apartments.",1
3662,"The building was so grand, so huge, so solid-seeming, that it gave the impression of having been hewn from the everlasting rock itself. Yet this was not true at all. The mighty edifice was really tubed and hollowed like a giant honeycomb. It was set on monstrous steel stilts, pillared below on vacancy, and sustained on curving arches. Its nerves, bones, and sinews went down below the level of the street to an underworld of storeyed basements, and below all these, far in the tortured rock, there was the tunnel's depth.",1
3663,"When dwellers in this imperial tenement felt a tremor at their feet, it was only then that they remembered there were trains beneath them--sleek expresses arriving and departing at all hours of the day and night. Then some of them reflected with immense satisfaction on the cleverness with which New York had reversed an order that is fixed and immutable everywhere else in America, and had made it fashionable to live, not merely ""beside the tracks"", but on top of them. A little before seven o'clock that October evening, old John, who ran one of the service elevators in the building, came walking slowly along Park Avenue, ready to go on duty for his night's work. He had reached the entrance and was just turning in when he was accosted by a man of thirty or thereabouts who was obviously in a state of vinous dilapidation.",1
3664,"Say, Bud----""  At the familiar words, uttered in a tone of fawning and yet rather menacing ingratiation, the face of the older man reddened with anger. He quickened his step and tried to move away, but the creature plucked at his sleeve and said in a low voice:  ""I was just wonderin' if you could spare a guy a----""  ""Na-h! the old man snapped angrily. I can't spare you anything! I'm twice your age and I always had to work for everything I got! If you was any good you'd do the same!",1
3665,"Oh yeah? the other jeered, looking at the old man with eyes that had suddenly gone hard and ugly. Yeah! old John snapped back, and then turned and passed through the great arched entrance of the building, feeling that his repartee had been a little inadequate, though it was the best he had been able to manage on the spur of the moment. He was still muttering to himself as he started along the colonnade that led to the south wing.",1
3666,"What's the matter, Pop? It was Ed, one of the day elevator men who spoke to him. Who got your goat?""  ""Ah-h,"" John muttered, still fuming with resentment, ""it's these panhandling bums!",1
3667,"One of 'em just stopped me outside the building and asked if I could spare a dime! A young fellow no older than you are, tryin' to panhandle from an old man like me! He ought to be ashamed of himself! I told him so, too. I said: 'If you was any good you'd work for it!'""  ""Yeah?"" said Ed, with mild interest.",1
3668,"Yeah,"" said John. They ought to keep those fellows away from here. They hang round this neighbourhood like flies at a molasses barrel. They got no right to bother the kind of people we got here. There was just a faint trace of mollification in his voice as he spoke of ""the kind of people we got here"".",1
3669,"One felt that on this side reverence lay. The kind of people we got here"" were, at all odds, to be protected and preserved. That's the only reason they hang round this place,"" the old man went on. They know they can play on the sympathy of the people in this building. Only the other night I saw one of 'em panhandle Mrs. Jack for a dollar. A big fellow, as well and strong as you are! I'd a good notion to tell her not to give him anything! If he wanted work, he could go and get him a job the same as you and me! It's got so if ain't safe for a woman in the house to take the dog round the block. Some greasy bum will be after her before she gets back. If I was the management I'd put a stop to it. A house like this can't afford it. The kind of people we got here don't have to stand for it!""  Having made these pronouncements, so full of outraged propriety and his desire to protect ""the kind of people we got here"" from further invasions of their trusting sanctity by these cadging frauds, old John, somewhat appeased, went in at the service entrance of the south wing, and in a few minutes he was at his post in the service elevator, ready for the night's work.",1
3670,"John Enborg had been born in Brooklyn more than sixty years before, the son of a Norwegian seaman and an Irish serving-girl. In spite of this mixed parentage, one would have said without hesitation that he was ""old stock"" American--New England Yankee, most likely. Even his physical structure had taken on those national characteristics which are perhaps the result, partly of weather and geography, partly of tempo, speech, and local custom--a special pattern of the nerves and vital energies wrought out upon the whole framework of flesh and bone, so that, from whatever complex sources they are derived, they are recognised instantly and unmistakably as ""American"".",1
3671,"In all these ways old John was ""American"". He had the dry neck--the lean, sinewy, furrowed neck that is engraved so harshly with so much weather. He had the dry face, too, seamed and squeezed of its moisture; the dry mouth, not brutal, certainly, but a little tight and stiff and woodenly inflexible; and the slightly outcropping lower jaw, as if the jarring conflicts in the life around him had hardened the very formations of the bone into this shape of unyielding tenacity. He was not much above the average height, but his whole body had the same stringy leanness of his neck and face, and this made him seem taller. The old man's hands were large and bony, corded with heavy veins, as if he had done much work with them. Even his voice and manner of talking were distinctively ""American"". His speech was spare, dry, nasal, and semi-articulate. It could have passed with most people as the speech of a Vermonter, although it did not have any pronounced twang. What one noticed about it especially was its Yankee economy and tartness, which seemed to indicate a chronic state of sour temper. But he was very far from being an ill-natured old man, though at times he did appear to be. It was just his way. He had a dry humour and really loved the rough and ready exchange of banter that went on among the younger elevator men around him, but he concealed his softer side behind a mask of shortness and sarcastic denial.",1
3672,"This was evident now as Herbert Anderson came in. Herbert was the night operator of the passenger elevator in the south entrance. He was a chunky, good-natured fellow of twenty-four or five, with two pink, mottled, absurdly fresh spots on his plump cheeks. He had lively and good-humoured eyes, and a mass of crinkly brownish hair of which one felt he was rather proud. He was John's special favourite in the whole building, although one might not have gathered this from the exchange that now took place between them.",1
3673,"Well, what do you say, Pop?"" cried Herbert as he entered the service elevator and poked the old man playfully in the ribs. You haven't seen anything of two blondes yet, have you? The faint, dry grin about John Enborg's mouth deepened a little almost to a stubborn line, as he swung the door to and pulled the lever.",1
3674,"Ah-h,"" he said sourly, almost in disgust, ""I don't know what you're talkin' about! The car descended and stopped, and he pulled the door open at the basement floor. Sure you do! Herbert flung back vigorously as he walked over to the line of lockers, peeled off his coat, and began to take off his collar and tie. You know those two blondes I been tellin' you about, doncha, Pop? By this time he was peeling the shirt off his muscular shoulders, then he supported himself with one hand against the locker while he stooped to take off his shoe.",1
3675,"Ah-h,"" said the old man, sour as before, ""you're always tellin' me about something. I don't even pay no attention to it. It goes in one ear and out the other. Oh yeah?"" said Herbert with a rising, ironical inflection.",1
3676,"He bent to unlace his other shoe. Yeah,"" said John dryly. From the beginning the old man's tone had been touched with this note of dry disgust, yet somehow he gave the impression that he was secretly amused by Herbert's chatter. For one thing, he made no move to depart. Instead, he had propped himself against the side of the open elevator door, and, his old arms folded loosely into the sleeves of the worn grey alpaca coat which was his ""uniform"", he was waiting there with the stubborn little grin round his mouth as if he was enjoying the debate and was willing to prolong it indefinitely.",1
3677,"So that's the kind of guy you are?"" said Herbert, stepping out of his neatly-pressed trousers and arranging them carefully on one of the hangers which he had taken from the locker. He hung the coat over the trousers and buttoned it. Here I go and get you all fixed up and you run out on me. O.K., Pop. His voice was now shaded with resignation. I thought you was a real guy, but if you're goin' to walk out on a party after I've gone to all the trouble, I'll have to look for somebody else. Oh yeah?"" said old John.",1
3678,"Yeah,"" said Herbert in the accent proper to this type of repartee. I had you all doped out for a live number, but I see I picked a dead one. John let this pass without comment.",1
3679,"Herbert stood for a moment in his socks and underwear, stiffening his shoulders, twisting, stretching, bending his arms upwards with tense muscular effort, and ending by scratching his head. Where's old Organisin' Hank? Herbert said presently. Seen him to-night? Who?"" said John, looking at him with a somewhat bewildered expression.",1
3680,"Henry. He wasn't at the door when I come in, and he ain't down here. He's gonna be late. Oh!",1
3681,"The word was small but it carried a heavy accent of disapproval. Say! The old man waved a gnarled hand stiffly in a downward gesture of dismissal. That guy's a pain in the neck! He spoke the words with the dry precision old men have when they try to ""keep up with"" a younger man by talking unaccustomed slang. A pain in the neck!"" he repeated. No, I ain't seen him to-night. Oh, Hank's all right when you get to know him,"" said Herbert cheerfully.",1
3682,"You know how a guy is when he gets all burned up about somethin'--he gets too serious about it--he thinks everybody else in the world ought to be like he is. But he's O.K. He's not a bad guy when you get him talkin' about somethin' else. Yeah!"" cried John suddenly and excitedly, not in agreement, but by way of introduction to something he had just remembered.",1
3683,"You know what he says to me the other day? 'I wonder what all the rich mugs in this house would do,' he says, 'if they had to get down and do a hard day's work for a livin' once in a while.' That's what he says to me! ' And these old bitches'--yeah!"" cried John, nodding his head angrily--""'these old bitches,' he says, 'that I got to help in and out of cars all night long, and can't walk up a flight of stairs by themselves--what if they had to get down on their hands and knees and scrub floors like your mother and my mother did?' That's the way he goes on all the time! cried John indignantly--""and him a-gettin' his livin' from the people in this house, and takin' tips from them--and then talkin' about them like he does!--Nah-h! John muttered to himself and rapped his fingers on the wall. I don't like that way of talkin'! If he feels that way, let him get out! I don't like that fellow. Oh,"" said Herbert easily and indifferently, ""Hank's not a bad guy, Pop.",1
3684,"He don't mean half of it. He's just a grouch. By this time, with the speed and deftness born of long experience, he was putting on the starched shirt-front which was a part of his uniform on duty, and buttoning the studs.",1
3685,"Stooping and squinting in the small mirror that was hung absurdly low on the wall, he said half-absently:  ""So you're goin' to run out on me and the two blondes? You can't take it, hunh?""  ""Ah-h,"" said old John with a return to his surly dryness, ""you don't know what you're talkin' about. I had more girls in my day than you ever thought of. Yeah?"" said Herbert.",1
3686,"Yeah,"" said John. I had blondes and brunettes and every other kind. Never had any red-heads, did you, Pop?"" said Herbert, grinning.",1
3687,"Yeah, I had red-heads, too,"" said John sourly. More than you had, anyway. Just a rounder, hunh?"" said Herbert.",1
3688,"Just an old petticoat-chaser. Nah-h, I ain't no rounder or no petticoat-chaser. Hm! John grunted contemptuously. I've been a married man for forty years. I got grown-up children older'n you are! Why, you old two-timer!",1
3689,"Herbert exclaimed, and turned on him with mock indignation. Braggin' to me about your blondes and red-heads, and then boastin' that you're a family man! Why, you----""  ""Nah-h,"" said John, ""I never done no such thing.",1
3690,"I wasn't talkin' about now--but then! That's when I had 'em--forty years ago. Who?"" said Herbert innocently.",1
3691,"Your wife and children?""  ""Ah-h,"" said John disgustedly, ""get along with you. You ain't goin' to get my goat. I've forgot more about life than you ever heard of, so don't think you're goin' to make a monkey out of me with your smart talk. Well, you're makin' a big mistake this time, Pop,"" said Herbert with an accent of regret.",1
3692,"He had drawn on the neat grey trousers of his uniform, adjusted his broad white stock, and now, half squatting before the mirror, he was carefully adjusting the coat about his well-set shoulders. Wait till you see 'em--these two blondes. I picked one of 'em out just for you. Well, you needn't pick out any for me,"" said John sourly.",1
3693,"I got no time for such foolishness. At this point Henry, 'the night doorman, came hurriedly in from the stairway and began rattling the key in his locker door. What do you say, pal? Herbert turned to him and cried boisterously. I leave it to you. Here I get Pop all dated up with a couple of hot blondes and he runs out on me. Is that treatin' a guy right or not?""  Henry did not answer.",1
3694,"His face was hard and white and narrow, his eyes had the look and colour of blue agate, and he never smiled. He took off his coat and hung it in the locker. Where were you?"" he said.",1
3695,"Herbert looked at him, startled. Where was I when?"" he said. Last night. That was my night off,"" said Herbert.",1
3696,"It wasn't our night off,"" said Henry. We had a meetin'. They was askin' about you. He turned and directed his cold eyes towards the old man. And you, too,"" he said in a hard tone. You didn't show up either. Old John's face had frozen.",1
3697,"He had shifted his position and begun to drum nervously and impatiently with his old fingers upon the side of the elevator. This quick, annoyed tapping betrayed his tension, but his eyes were flinty as he returned Henry's look, and there was no mistaking his dislike of the doorman. Theirs was, in fact, the mutual hostility that is instinctive to two opposite types of personality.",1
3698,"Oh yeah? John said in a hard voice. Henry answered briefly: ""Yeah. And then, holding his cold look levelled like a pointed pistol, he said: ""You come to the union meetin's like everybody else, see? Or you'll get bounced out. You may be an old man, but that goes for you like it does for all the rest. Is that so?"" said John sarcastically.",1
3699,"Yeah, that's so. His tone was flat and final. Jesus! Herbert's face was red with crestfallen embarrassment, and he stammered out an excuse. I forgot all about it--honest I did! I was just goin'----""  ""Well, you're not supposed to forget,"" said Henry harshly, and he looked at Herbert with an accusing eye.",1
3700,"I--I'm all up on my dues,"" said Herbert feebly. That ain't the question. We ain't talkin' about dues. For the first time there was indignant passion in the hard voice as he went on earnestly: ""Where the hell do you suppose we'd be if everybody ran out on us every time we hold a meetin'? What's the use of anything if we ain't goin' to stick together? He was silent now, looking almost sullenly at Herbert, whose red face had the hang-dog air of a guilty schoolboy.",1
3701,"But when Henry spoke again his tone was gentler and more casual, and somehow it suggested that underneath his hard exterior he had a genuine affection for his errant comrade. I guess it's O.K. this time,"" he said quietly. I told the guys you had a cold and I'd get you there next time. He said nothing more, and began swiftly to take off his clothes.",1
3702,"Herbert looked flustered but relieved. For a moment he seemed about to speak, but changed his mind. He stooped and took a final appraising look at himself in the small mirror, and then, walking quickly towards the elevator with a return of his former buoyancy, he said:  ""Well, Pop, O.K.--let's go!",1
3703,"He took his place in the car and went on with a simulation of regret: ""Too bad you're goin' to miss out on the blondes, Pop. But maybe you'll change your mind when you get a look at 'em. No, I won't change my mind, neither,"" said John with sour implacability as he slammed the door.",1
3704,"About them or about you. Herbert looked at the old man and laughed, the pink spots in his cheeks flushed with good humour, his lively eyes dancing. So that's the kind of guy you think I am?"" he said, and gently poked the old fellow in the ribs with his closed fist. So you don't believe me, hunh?""  ""Ah-h, I wouldn't believe you on a stack of bibles,"" said John grouchily.",1
3705,"He pushed the lever forwards and the elevator started up. You're a lot of talk--that's what you are. I don't listen to anything you say:"" He stopped the elevator and opened the heavy door.",1
3706,"So that's the kind of friend you are?"" said Herbert, stepping out into the corridor. Full of himself, full of delight with his own humour, he winked at two pretty, rosy-cheeked Irish maids who were waiting to go up, and, jerking his thumb towards the old man, he said: ""What are you goin' to do with a guy like this, anyway? I go and get him all dated up with a blonde and he won't believe me when I tell him so. He calls me a big wind. Yeah, that's what he is,"" said the old man grimly to the smiling girls.",1
3707,"He's a lot of wind. He's always talkin' about his girls and I bet he never had a girl in his life. If he saw a blonde he'd run like a rabbit. Just a pal!"" said Herbert with mock bitterness, appealing to the maids.",1
3708,"O.K., then, Pop. Have it your own way. But when those blondes get here, tell 'em to wait till I come back. You hear? Well, you'd better not be bringin' any of 'em round here,"" said John.",1
3709,"He shook his white, head doggedly and his whole manner was belligerent, but it was evident that he was enjoying himself hugely. I don't want any of 'em comin' in this building--blondes or brunettes or red-heads or any of 'em,"" he muttered. If they do, you won't find 'em when you come back. I'll tell 'em to get out. I'll handle 'em for you, all right. He's a friend of mine!"" said Herbert bitterly to the two girls, and jerked his thumb towards the old man again.",1
3710,"He started to walk away. I don't believe you, anyhow,"" John called after his retreating figure. You ain't got no blondes. You never did have...You're a momma's boy! he cried triumphantly as an afterthought, as if he had now hit upon the happiest inspiration of the evening. That's what you are!""  Herbert paused at the door leading into the main corridor and looked back menacingly at the old man, but the look was belied by the sparkle in his eyes.",1
3711,"Oh yeah?"" he shouted. He stood and glared fiercely at the old fellow for a moment, then winked at the two girls, passed through the door, and pressed the button of the passenger elevator, whose operator he was to relieve for the night. That fellow's just a lot of talk,"" said John sourly as the maids stepped into the service car and he closed the door. Always gassin' about the blondes he's goin' to bring round--but I ain't never seen none of 'em. Nah-h! he muttered scornfully, almost to himself as the car started up. He lives with his mother up in the Bronx, and he'd be scared stiff if a girl ever looked at him. Still, Herbert ought to have a girl,"" one of the maids said in a practical tone of voice.",1
3712,"Herbert's a nice boy, John.""  ""Oh, he's all right, I guess,"" the old man muttered grudgingly. And a nice-looking boy, too,"" the other maid now said. Oh, he'll do,"" said John; and then abruptly: ""What are you folks doin' to-night, anyway? There's a whole lot of packages waitin' to come up. Mrs. Jack is having a big party,"" one of the girls said.",1
3713,"And, John, will you bring everything up as soon as you can? There may be something there that we need right away. Well,"" he said in that half-belligerent, half-unwilling tone that was an inverted attribute of his real good nature.",1
3714,"I'll do the best I can. Seems like all of them are givin' their big parties to-night,"" he grumbled. It goes on sometimes here till two or three o'clock in the morning. You'd think all some people had to do was give parties all the time. It'd take a whole regiment of men just to carry up the packages. Yeah! he muttered to himself. And what d'you get? If you ever got so much as a word of thanks----""  ""Oh, John,"" one of the girls now said reproachfully, ""you know Mrs. Jack is not like that!",1
3715,"You know yourself----""  ""Oh, she's all right, I reckon,"" said John, unwillingly as before, yet his tone had softened imperceptibly. If all of them was like her,"" he began--but then the memory of the panhandler came back to him, and he went on angrily: ""She's too kind-hearted for her own good! Them panhandling bums--they swarm round her like flies every time she leaves the building. I saw one the other night get a dollar out of her before she'd gone twenty feet. She's crazy to put up with it. I'm goin' to tell her so, too, when I see her!",1
3716,"The old man's face was flushed with outrage at the memory. He had opened the door on the service landing, and now, as the girls stepped out, he muttered to himself again:  ""The kind of people we got here oughtn't to have to put up with it... Well, then, I'll see,"" he said concedingly, as one of the maids unlocked the service door and went in. I'll get the stuff up to you. For a second or two after the inner door had closed behind the maids, the old man stood there looking at it--just a dull, blank sheet of painted metal with the apartment number on it--and his glance, had anyone seen it, would somehow have conveyed an impression of affectionate regard.",1
3717,"Then he closed the elevator door and started down. Henry, the doorman, was just coming up the basement stairway as the old man reached the ground floor. Uniformed, ready for his night's work, he passed the service elevator without speaking. John called to him.",1
3718,"If they try to deliver any packages out front,"" he said, ""you send 'em round here. Henry turned and looked at the old man unsmilingly, and said curtly: ""What?""  ""I say,"" repeated John, raising his voice a trifle shrilly, for the man's habitual air of sullen harshness angered him, ""if they try to make any deliveries out front, send 'em back to the service entrance. Henry continued to look at him without speaking, and the old man added:  ""The Jacks are givin' a party to-night.",1
3719,"They asked me to get everything up in a hurry. If there are any more deliveries, send 'em back here. Why?"" said Henry in his flat, expressionless voice, still staring at him.",1
3720,"The question, with its insolent suggestion of defied authority--someone's authority, his own, the management's, or the authority of ""the kind of people we got here""--infuriated the old man. A wave of anger, hot and choking, welled up in him, and before he could control himself he rasped out:  ""Because that's where they ought to come--that's why! Haven't you been workin' around places of this kind long enough to know how to do? Don't you know the kind of people we got here don't want every Tom, Dick, and Harry with a package to deliver runnin' up in the front elevator all the time, mixin' in with all the people in the house? Why?"" said Henry with deliberate insolence.",1
3721,"Why don't they?""  ""Because,"" old John shouted, his face now crimson, ""if you ain't got sense enough to know that much, you ought to quit and get a job diggin' ditches somewhere! You're bein' paid to know it! That's part of your job as doorman in a house like this! If you ain't got sense enough by now to do what you're supposed to do, you'd better quit--that's why!--and give your job to somebody who knows what it's all about!""  Henry just looked at him with eyes that were as hard and emotionless as two chunks of agate.",1
3722,"Then:  ""Listen,"" he said in a toneless voice. You know what's goin' to happen to you if you don't watch out? You're gettin' old, Pop, and you'd better watch your step. You're goin' to be caught in the street some day worryin' about what's goin' to happen to the people in this place if they have to ride up in the same elevator with a delivery boy. You're goin' to worry about them gettin' contaminated because they got to ride up in the same car with some guy that carries a package. And you know what's goin' to happen, to you, Pop? I'll tell you what's goin' to happen. You'll be worryin' about it so much that you ain't goin' to notice where you're goin'. And you're goin' to get hit, see? The voice was so unyielding in its toneless savagery that for a moment--just for a moment--the old man felt himself trembling all over.",1
3723,"And the voice went on:  ""You're goin' to get hit, Pop. And it ain't goin' to be by nothin' small or cheap. It ain't goin' to be by no Ford truck or by no taxi-cab. You're goin' to get hit by somethin' big and shiny that cost a lot of dough. You'll get hit by at least a Rolls Royce. And I hope it belongs to one of the people in this house. You'll die like any other worm, but I want you to push off knowin' that it was done expensive--by a big Rolls Royce--by one of the people in this house. I just want you to be happy, Pop.""  Old John's face was purple.",1
3724,"The veins in his forehead stood out like corded ropes. He tried to speak, but no words came. At length, all else having failed him, he managed to choke out the one retort which, in all its infinitely variable modulations, always served perfectly to convey his emotions.",1
3725,"Oh yeah! he snarled dryly, and this time the words were loaded with implacable and unforgiving hate. Yeah!"" said Henry tonelessly, and walked off.",1
3726,"14. Zero Hour Mrs. Jack came from her room a little after eight o'clock and walked along the broad hallway that traversed her big apartment from front to rear. Her guests had been invited for half-past eight, but long experience in these matters told her that the party would not be going at full swing until after nine. As she walked along the corridor at a brisk and rapid little step she felt a tense excitement, not unpleasurable, even though it was now sharpened by the tincture of an apprehensive doubt.",1
3727,Would all be ready? Had she forgotten anything? Had the girls followed her instructions? Or had they slipped up somewhere? Would something now be lacking?,1
3728,"A wrinkled line appeared between her eyes, and unconsciously she began to slip the old ring on and off her finger with a quick movement of her small hand. It was the gesture of an alert and highly able person who had come to have an instinctive mistrust of other people less gifted than herself. There was impatience and some scorn in it, a scorn not born of arrogance or any lack of warm humanity, but one that was inclined to say a trifle sharply: ""Yes, yes, I know! I understand all that. There's no need telling me that kind of thing. Let's get to the point. What can you do? What have you done? Can I depend on you to do everything that's necessary? So, as she walked briskly down the hall, thoughts too sharp and quick for definition were darting across the surface of her mind like flicks of light upon a pool.",1
3729,"I wonder if the girls remembered to do everything I told them,"" she was thinking. Oh, Lord! If only Nora hasn't started drinking again!--And Janie! She's good as gold, of course, but God, she is a fool!--And Cookie! Well, she can cook, but after that she doesn't know April from July. And if you try to tell her anything she gets flustered and begins to gargle German at you. Then it's worse than if you'd never spoken to her at all.--As for May--well, all you can do is to hope and pray. The line between her troubled eyes deepened, and the ring slipped on and off her finger more rapidly than ever. You'd think they'd realise how well off they are, and what a good life they lead here! You'd think they'd try to show it! she thought indignantly. But almost instantly she was touched with a feeling of tender commiseration, and her mind veered back into its more usual channel: ""Oh, well, poor things! I suppose they do the best they can. All you can do is to reconcile yourself to it--and realise that the only way you can get anything done right is to do it yourself. By this time she had reached the entrance to the living-room and was looking quickly about, assuring herself by a moment's swift inspection that everything was in its proper place.",1
3730,"Her examination pleased her. The worried expression about her eyes began to disappear. She slipped the ring back on her hand and let it stay there, and her face began to take on the satisfied look of a child when it regards in silence some object of its love and self-creation and finds it good.",1
3731,"The big room was ready for the party. It was just quietly the way she always liked to have it. The room was so nobly proportioned as to be almost regal, and yet it was so subtly toned by the labour of her faultless taste that whatever forbidding coldness its essential grandeur may have had was utterly subdued. To a stranger this living-room would have seemed not only homelike in its comfortable simplicity, but even, on closer inspection, a trifle shabby. Almost everything in it was somewhat worn. The coverings of some of the chairs and couches had become in places threadbare. The carpet that covered the floor with its pattern of old, faded green showed long use without apology. An antique gate-legged table sagged a little under the weight of its pleasant shaded lamp and its stacks of books and magazines. Upon the mantel, a creamy slab of marble, itself a little stained and worn, was spread a green and faded strip of Chinese silk, and on top of it was a lovely little figure in green jade, its carved fingers lifted in a Chinese attitude of compassionating mercy. Over the mantel hung a portrait of herself in her young loveliness at twenty, which a painter now dead and famous had made long ago.",1
3732,"On three sides of the room, bookshelves extended a third of the way up the walls, and they were crowded with friendly volumes whose backs bore the markings of warm human hands. Obviously they had been read and read again. The stiff sets of tooled and costly bindings that often ornament the libraries of the rich with unread awe were lacking here. Nor was there any evidence of the greedy and revolting mania of the professional collector. If there were first editions on these utilitarian shelves, they were here because their owner had bought them when they were published, and bought them to be read.",1
3733,"The crackling pine logs on the great marble hearth cast their radiance warmly on the covers of these worn books, and Mrs. Jack had a sense of peace and comfort as she looked at the rich and homely compact of their colours. She saw her favourite novels and histories, plays, poems, and biographies, and the great books of decoration and design, of painting, drawing, and architecture, which she had assembled in a crowded lifetime of work, travel, and living. Indeed, all these objects, these chairs and tables, these jades and silks, all the drawings and paintings, as well as the books, had been brought together at different times and places and fused into a miracle of harmony by the instinctive touch of this woman's hand. It is no wonder, therefore, that her face softened and took on an added glow of loveliness as she looked at her fine room. The like of it, as she well knew, could nowhere else be found.",1
3734,"Ah, here it is,"" she thought. It is living like a part of me. And God! How beautiful it is! she thought. How warm--how true! It's not like a rented place--not just another room in an apartment. No""--she glanced down the spacious width of the long hall--""if it weren't for the elevator there, you'd think it was some grand old house.' I don't know--but--"" a little furrow, this time of reflectiveness and effort, came between her eyes as she tried to shape her meaning--""there's something sort of grand--and simple--about it all.",1
3735,"And indeed there was. The amount of simplicity that could be purchased even in, those times for a yearly rental of fifteen thousand dollars was quite considerable. As if this very thought had found an echo in her mind, she went on:  ""I mean when you compare it with some of these places that you see nowadays--some of the God-awful places where all those rich people live.",1
3736,"There's simply no comparison! I don't care how rich they are, there's--there's just something here that money cannot buy. As her mind phrased the accusing words about ""the God-awful places where all those rich people live,"" her nostrils twitched and her face took on an expression of sharp scorn.",1
3737,"For Mrs. Jack had always been contemptuous of wealth. Though she was the wife of a rich man and had not known for years the economic necessity of work, yet it was one of her unshakable convictions that she and her family could not possibly be described as ""rich"". Oh, not really,"" she would say. Not the way people are who really are. And she would look for confirmation, not at the hundred and thirty million people there impossibly below her in the world's hard groove, but at the fabulous ten thousand who were above her on the moneyed heights, and who, by the comparison, were ""really rich"".",1
3738,"Besides, she was ""a worker"". She had always been ""a worker"". One look at the strength, the grace, the swiftness of those small, sure hands were enough to tell the story of their owner's life, which had always been a life of work. From that accomplishment stemmed deep pride and the fundamental integrity of her soul. She had needed the benefit of no man's purse, the succour of no man's shielding strength. Is not my help within me? Well, hers was. She had made her own way. She had supported herself. She had created beautiful and enduring things. She had never known the meaning of laziness. Therefore it is no wonder that she never thought of herself as being ""rich"". She was a worker; she had worked.",1
3739,"But now, satisfied with her inspection of the big room, she turned quickly to investigate other things. The living room gave on the dining-room through glass doors, which were closed and curtained filmily. Mrs. Jack moved towards them and threw them open. Then she stopped short, and one hand flew to her bosom. She gasped out an involuntary little ""Oh!"" of wonder and delight. It was too beautiful! It was quite too beautiful! But it was just the way she expected it to look--the way it looked for all of her parties. None the less, every time she saw it, it was like a grand and new discovery.",1
3740,"Everything had been arranged to perfection. The great dining table glowed faultlessly, like a single sheet of walnut light. In its centre, on a doily of thick lace, stood a large and handsome bowl blossoming with a fragrant harvest of cut flowers. At the four corners, in orderly array, there were big stacks of Dresden plates and gleaming rows of old and heavy English silver, knives and forks and spoons. The ancient Italian chairs had been drawn away and placed against the walls. This was to be a buffet supper. The guests could come and help themselves according to their taste, and on that noble table was everything to tempt even the most jaded palate.",1
3741,"Upon an enormous silver trencher at one end there was a mighty roast of beef, crisply browned all over. It had just been ""begun on"" at one side, for a few slices had been carved away to leave the sound, rare body of the roast open to the inspection of anyone who might be attracted by its juicy succulence. At the opposite end, upon another enormous trencher, and similarly carved, was a whole Virginia Ham, sugar-cured and baked and stuck all over with pungent cloves. In between and all round was a staggering variety of mouth-watering delicacies. There were great bowls of mixed green salads, and others of chicken salad, crab meat, and the pink, milky firmness of lobster claws, removed whole and perfect from their shells. There were platters containing golden slabs of smoked salmon, the most rare and delicate that money could buy. There were dishes piled with caviar, both black and red, and countless others loaded with hors d'oeuvres--with mushrooms, herring, anchovies, sardines, and small, toothsome artichokes, with pickled onions and with pickled beets, with sliced tomatoes and with devilled eggs, with walnuts, almonds, and pecans, with olives and with celery. In short, there was almost everything that anyone could desire.",1
3742,"It was a gargantuan banquet. It was like some great vision of a feast that has been made immortal in legendry. Few ""rich"" people would have dared venture on a ""supper"" such as this of Mrs. Jack's, and in this fear of venturing they would have been justified. Only Mrs. Jack could do a thing like this; only she could do it right. And that is why her parties were famous, and why everyone who had been invited always came. For, strange to tell, there was nowhere on that lavish board a suggestion of disorder or excess. That table was a miracle of planning and of right design. Just as no one could look at it and possibly want anything to be added, so could no one here have felt that there was a single thing too much.",1
3743,"And everywhere in that great dining-room, with its simplicity and strength, there was evident this same faultless taste, this same style that never seemed to be contrived, that was so casual and so gracious and so right. At one side the great buffet glittered with an array of flasks, decanters, bottle, syphons, and tall glasses, thin as shells. Elsewhere, two lovely Colonial cupboards stood like Graces with their splendid wares of china and of porcelain, of cut-glass and of silver, of grand old plates and cups and saucers, tureens and bowls, jars and pitchers.",1
3744,"After a quick, satisfied appraisal of everything, Mrs. Jack walked rapidly across the room and through the swinging door that led to the pantry and the kitchen and the servants' quarters. As she approached, she could hear the laughter and excited voices of the maids, broken by the gutturally mixed phrases of the cook. She burst upon a scene of busy order and of readiness. The big, tiled kitchen was as clean and spotless as a hospital laboratory. The great range with its marvellous hood, itself as large as those one sees in a big restaurant, looked as if it had been freshly scrubbed and oiled and polished. The vast company of copper cooking vessels--the skillets and kettles, the pots and pans of every size and shape, from those just large enough to hold an egg to those so huge it seemed that one might cook in them the rations of a regiment--had been scoured and rubbed until Mrs. Jack cloud see her face in them. The big table in the centre of the room was white enough to have served in a surgeon's office, and the shelves, drawers, cupboards, and bins looked as if they had just been gone over with sandpaper. Above the voices of the girls brooded the curiously quiet, intent, dynamic hum of the mammoth electric refrigerator, which in its white splendour was like a jewel.",1
3745,"Oh, this!"" thought Mrs. Jack. This is quite the most perfect thing of all! This is the best room in the house! I love the others--but is there anything in the world so grand and beautiful as a fine kitchen? And how Cookie keeps the place! If I could only paint it! But no--it would take a Breughel to do it! There's no one nowadays to do it justice----""  ""Oh, Cookie!",1
3746,"Now she spoke the words aloud. What a lovely cake! Cook looked up from the great layer cake on the table to which she had been adding the last prayerful tracery of frosted icing, and a faint smile illuminated the gaunt, blunt surface of her Germanic face.",1
3747,"You like him, yes?"" said Cook. You think he is nice?""  ""Oh, Cook!"" cried Mrs. Jack in a tone of such childlike earnestness that Cook smiled this time a little more broadly than before. It is the most beautiful--the most wonderful!--"" She turned away with a comical shrug of despair as if words failed her.",1
3748,"Cook laughed gutturally with satisfaction, and Nora, smiling, said:  ""Yes, Mrs. Jack, that it is! It's just what I was after tellin' her meself. Mrs. Jack glanced swiftly at Nora and saw with relief that she was clean and plain and sober.",1
3749,"Thank heaven she had pulled herself together! She hadn't taken another drink since morning--that was easy to see. Drink worked on her like poison, and you could tell the moment that she'd had a single one.  Janie and May, passing back and forth between the kitchen and the maid's sitting-room in their trim, crisp uniforms and with their smiling pink faces, were really awfully pretty.",1
3750,"Everything had turned out perfectly, better than she could possibly have expected. Nothing had been forgotten. Everything was in readiness. It ought to be a glorious party.",1
3751,"At this moment the buzzer sounded sharply. Mrs. Jack looked startled and said quickly:  ""The door-bell rang, Janie. Then, almost to herself: ""Now who do you suppose--? Yes'm,"" said Janie, coming to the door of the maids' sitting-room.",1
3752,"I'll go, Mrs. Jack. Yes, you'd better, Janie. I wonder who--"" she cast a puzzled look up at the clock on the wall, and then at the little shell of platinum on her wrist. It's only eight-fifteen! I can't think any of them would be this early. Oh!""--as illumination came--""I think, perhaps, it's Mr. Logan. If it is, Janie, show him in. I'll be right out. Yes, Mrs. Jack,"" said Janie, and departed.",1
3753,"And Mrs. Jack, after another quick look about the kitchen, another smile of thanks and approbation for Cookie and her arts, followed her. It was Mr. Logan. Mrs. Jack encountered him in the entrance hall where he had just paused to set down two enormous black suitcases, each of which, from the bulging look of them, carried enough weight to strain strong muscles. Mr. Logan's own appearance confirmed this impression. He had seized the biceps of one muscular arm with the fingers of his other hand, and with a rueful look upon his face was engaged in flexing the aching member up and down. As Mrs. Jack approached he turned, a thickset, rather burly-looking young man of about thirty, with bushy eyebrows of a reddish cast, a round and heavy face smudged ruddily with the shaven grain of his beard, a low, corrugated forehead, and a bald head gleaming with perspiration, which he proceeded to mop with his handkerchief.",1
3754,"Gosh!"" said Mr. Piggy Logan, for by this affectionate title was he known to his more intimate acquaintance. Gosh!""--the expletive came out again, somewhat windy with relief. At the same time he released his aching arm and offered his hostess a muscular and stubby hand, covered thickly on the back up to the very fingernails with large freckles.",1
3755,"You must be simply dead! cried Mrs. Jack. Why didn't you let me know you had so much to carry? I'd have sent a chauffeur. He could have handled everything for you. Oh, it's quite all right,"" said Piggy Logan.",1
3756,"I always manage everything myself. You see, I carry all of it right here--my whole equipment. He indicated the two ponderous cases. That's it,"" he said, ""everything I use--the whole show. So naturally,"" he smiled at her quickly and quite boyishly, ""I don't like to take any chances. It's all I've got. If anything went wrong--well, I'd just rather do it myself and then I know where I am. I know,"" said Mrs. Jack, nodding her head with quick understanding.",1
3757,"You simply can't depend on others. If anything went wrong--and after all the years you must have put in making them! People who've seen it say it's simply marvellous,"" she went on. Everyone is so thrilled to know you're going to be here. We've heard so much about it--really all you hear around New York these days is----""  ""Now--"" said Mr. Logan abruptly, in a manner that was still courteous but that indicated he was no longer paying any attention to her.",1
3758,"He had become all business, and now he walked over to the entrance of the living-room and was looking all about with thoughtful speculation. I suppose it's going to be in here, isn't it?"" he said. Yes--that is, if you like it here. If you prefer, we'll use another room, but this is the largest one we have. No, thank you,"" crisply, absently.",1
3759,"This is quite all right. This will do very nicely...Hm! meditatively, as he pressed his full lower lip between two freckled fingers. Best place, I should think, would be over there,"" he indicated the opposite wall, ""facing the door here, the people all round on the other three sides...Hm! Yes...Just about the centre there, I should think, posters on the bookshelves... We can clear all this stuff away, of course,"" he make a quick but expansive gesture with his hand which seemed to dispose of a large part of the furnishings. Yes! That ought to do it very well!...Now, if you don't mind,"" he turned to her rather peremptorily and said: ""I'll have to change to costume. If you have a room----""  ""Oh, yes,"" she answered quickly, ""here, just down the hall, the first room on the right.",1
3760,"But won't you have a drink and something to eat before you start? You must be terribly----""  ""No, thank you,"" said Mr. Logan crisply. It's very nice of you,"" he smiled swiftly under his bushy brows, ""but I never take anything before a performance. Now""--he crouched, gripped the handles of the big cases, and heaved mightly--""if you'll just--excuse me,"" he grunted.",1
3761,"Is there anything we can do? Mrs. Jack asked helpfully. No--thank you--nothing,"" Mr. Logan somewhat gruntingly replied, and began to stagger down the hall with his tremendous freight. I can--get along--quite nicely--thank you,"" he grunted as he staggered through the door of the room to which she had directed him; and then, more faintly: ""Nothing--at all. She heard the two ponderous bags hit the floor with a leaden thump, and then Mr. Logan's long, expiring ""Whush!"" of exhausted relief.",1
3762,"For a moment after the young man's lurching departure, his hostess continued to look after him with a somewhat dazed expression, touched faintly with alarm. His businesslike dispatch and the nonchalance with which he had suggested widespread alterations in her beloved room filled her with vague apprehension. But--she shook her head and reassured herself with sharp decision--it was bound to be all right. She had heard so many people speak of him: he was really all the rage this year, everyone was talking of his show, there had been write-ups of him everywhere. He was the darling of all the smart society crowd--all those ""rich"" Long Island and Park Avenue people. Here the lady's nostrils curved again in a faint dilation of patronising scorn; nevertheless, she could not help feeling a pleasant sense of triumph that she had landed him.",1
3763,"Yes, Mr. Piggy Logan was the rage that year. He was the creator of a puppet circus of wire dolls, and the applause with which this curious entertainment had been greeted was astonishing. Not to be able to discuss him and his little dolls intelligently was, in smart circles, akin to never having heard of Jean Cocteau or Surrealism; it was like being completely at a loss when such names as Picasso and Brancusi and Utrillo and Gertrude Stein were mentioned. Mr. Piggy Logan and his art were spoken of with the same animated reverence that the knowing used when they spoke of one of these.",1
3764,"And, like all of these, Mr. Piggy Logan and his art demanded their own vocabulary. To speak of them correctly one must know a language whose subtle nuances were becoming more highly specialised month by month, as each succeeding critic outdid his predecessor and delved deeper into the bewildering complexities, the infinite shadings and associations, of Mr. Piggy Logan and his circus of wire dolls. True, at the beginning there had been those among the cognoscenti--those happy pioneers who had got in at the very start of Mr. Piggy Logan's vogue--who had characterised his performance as ""frightfully amusing"". But that was old stuff, and anyone who now dared to qualify Mr. Logan's art with such a paltry adjective as ""amusing"" was instantly dismissed as a person of no cultural importance. Mr. Logan's circus had ceased to be ""amusing"" when one of the more sophisticated columnists of the daily press discovered that ""not since the early Chaplin has the art of tragic humour through the use of pantomime reached such a faultless elevation. After this, the procession formed on the right, and each newcomer paid his tribute with a new and more glittering coin.",1
3765,"The articles in the daily press were followed by others in all the smarter publications, with eulogistic essays on Mr. Logan and pictures of his little dolls. Then the dramatic critics joined the chorus, and held up the offerings of the current stage to a withering fire of comparative criticism. The leading tragedians of the theatre were instructed to pay special attention to Mr. Logan's clown before they next essayed the role of Hamlet.",1
3766,"The solemn discussions broke out everywhere. Two eminent critics engaged in a verbal duel of such adeptive subtlety that in the end it was said there were not more than seven people in the civilised world who could understand the final passages at arms. The central issue of this battle was to establish whether Mr. Piggy Logan, in his development, had been influenced more by the geometric cubism of the early Picasso or by the geometric abstractions of Brancusi. Both schools of thought had their impassioned followers, but it was finally conceded that the Picassos had somewhat the better of it.",1
3767,"One word from Mr. Logan himself might have settled the controversy, but that word was never spoken. Indeed, he said very little about the hubbub he had caused. As more than one critic significantly pointed out, he had ""the essential simplicity of the great artist--an almost childlike naïveté of speech and gesture that pierces straight to the heart of reality. Even his life, his previous history, resisted investigations of the biographers with the impenetrability of the same baffling simplicity. Or, as another critic clearly phrased it: ""As in the life of almost all great men of art, there is little in Logan's early years to indicate his future achievement. Like almost all supremely great men, he developed slowly--and, it might almost be said, unheeded--up to the time when he burst suddenly, like a blazing light, upon the public consciousness. However that may be, Mr. Piggy Logan's fame was certainly blazing now, and an entire literature in the higher aesthetics had been created about him and his puppets.",1
3768,"Critical reputations had been made or ruined by them. The last criterion of fashionable knowingness that year was an expert familiarity with Mr. Logan and his dolls. If one lacked this knowledge, he was lower than the dust. If one had it, his connoisseurship in the arts was definitely established and his eligibility for any society of the higher sensibilities was instantly confirmed.",1
3769,"To a future world--inhabited, no doubt, by a less acute and understanding race of men--all this may seem a trifle strange. If so, that will be because the world of the future will have forgotten what it was like to live in 1929. In that sweet year of grace one could admit with utter nonchalance that the late John Milton bored him and was a large ""stuffed shirt"". Stuffed shirts"", indeed, were numerous in the findings of the critical gentry of the time. The chemises of such inflated personalities as Goethe, Ibsen, Byron, Tolstoy, Whitman, Dickens, and Balzac had been ruthlessly investigated by some of the most fearless intellects of the day and found to be largely filled with straw wadding. Almost everything and everybody was in the process of being debunked--except the debunkers and Mr. Piggy Logan and his dolls.",1
3770,"Life had recently become too short for many things that people had once found time for. Life was simply too short for the perusal of any book longer than two hundred pages. As for War and Peace--no doubt all ""they"" said of it was true--but as for oneself--well, one had tried, and really it was quite too--too--oh, well, life simply was too short. So life that year was far too short to be bothered by Tolstoy, Whitman, Dreiser, or Dean Swift. But life was not too short that year to be passionately concerned with Mr. Piggy Logan and his circus of wire dolls.",1
3771,"The highest intelligences of the time--the very subtlest of the chosen few--were bored by many things. They tilled the waste land, and erosion had grown fashionable. They were bored with love, and they were bored with hate. They were bored with men who worked, and with men who loafed. They were bored with people who created something, and with people who created nothing. They were bored with marriage, and with single blessedness. They were bored with chastity, and they were bored with adultery. They were bored with going abroad, and they were bored with staying at home. They were bored with the great poets of the world, whose great poems they had never read. They were bored with hunger in the streets, with the men who were killed, with the children who starved, and with the injustice, cruelty, and oppression all round them; and they were bored with justice, freedom, and man's right to live. They were bored with living, they were bored with dying, but--they were not bored that year with Mr. Piggy Logan and his circus of wire dolls.",1
3772,"And the Cause of all this tumult? The generating Force behind this mighty sensation in the world of Art? As one of the critics so aptly said: ""It is a great deal more than just a new talent that has started just another 'movement': it is rather a whole new universe of creation, a whirling planet which in its fiery revolutions may be expected to throw off its own sidereal systems. All right; It, then--the colossal Genius which had started all this--what was It doing now?",1
3773,"It was now enjoying the privacy of one of the lovely rooms in Mrs. Jack's apartment, and, as if It were utterly unaware of the huge disturbance It had made in the great world, It was calmly, quietly, modestly, prosaically, and matter-of-factly occupied in peeling off Its own trousers and pulling on a pair of canvas pants. While this momentous happening was taking place, events were moving smoothly to their consummation in other quarters of the house. The swinging door between the dining-room and the kitchen domain kept slatting back and forth as the maids passed in and out to make the final preparations for the feast. Janie came through the dining-room bearing a great silver tray filled with bottles, decanters, a bowl of ice, and tall, lovely glasses. As she set the tray down upon a table in the living-room, the shell-thin glasses chimed together musically, and there was a pleasant jink of bottles and the cold, clean rattle of cracked ice.",1
3774,"Then the girl came over towards the hearth, removed the big brass screen, and knelt before the dancing flames. As she jabbed at the logs with a long brass poker and a pair of tongs there was a shower of fiery sparks, and the fire blazed and crackled with new life. For just a moment she stayed there on her knees in a gesture of sweet maiden grace. The fire cast its radiance across her glowing face, and Mrs. Jack looked at her with a softened glance, thinking how sweet and clean and pretty she was. Then the maid arose and put the screen back in its place.",1
3775,"Mrs. Jack was arranging anew a vase of long-stemmed roses on a small table in the hall and glancing briefly at herself in the mirror above, turned and walked briskly and happily down the broad, deep-carpeted hallway towards her own room. Her husband was just coming from his room. He was fully dressed for the evening. She looked him over with an expert eye, and saw how well his clothes fit him and how he wore them as if they had grown on him.",1
3776,"His manner, in contrast to hers, was calm and sophisticated, wise and knowing. One knew just to look at him that he took excellent care of himself. Here was a man, one felt, who, if he was experienced in the pleasures of the flesh, knew how far to go, and beyond what point lay chaos, shipwreck, and the reef. His wife, taking all this in with a swift and comprehensive glance that missed nothing, despite her air of half-bewildered innocence, was amazed to see how much he knew, and a little troubled to think that he knew even more, perhaps, than she could see or fathom.",1
3777,"Oh, hello,"" he said, in a tone of suave courtesy as he bent and kissed her lightly on one cheek. For just the flick of an instant she was conscious of a feeling of distaste, but then she remembered what a perfect husband he had been, how thoughtful, how good, how devoted, and how, no matter what the unfathomed implications of his eyes might be, he had said nothing--and for all that anyone could prove, had seen nothing. He's a sweet person,"" she was thinking as she responded brightly to his greeting:  ""Oh, hello, darling.",1
3778,"You're all ready, aren't you?...Listen""--she spoke rapidly--""will you look out for the bell and take care of anyone who comes? Mr. Logan is changing his costume in the guest room--won't you look out for him if he needs anything? And see if Edith's ready. And when the guests begin to come you can send the women to her room to take off their wraps--oh, just tell Nora--she'll attend to it! And you'll take care of the men yourself--won't you, dear? You can show them back to your room. I'll be out in a few minutes. If only everything!""--she began in a worried tone, slipping the ring quickly from her finger and slipping it back again. I do hope everything's all right!",1
3779,"But isn't it? he said blandly. Haven't you looked? Oh, everything looks perfect!",1
3780,"she cried. It's really just too beautiful! The girls have behaved wonderfully--only""--the little furrow of nervous tension came between her eyes--""do keep an eye on them, won't you, Fritz? You know how they are if somebody's not round. Something's so likely to go wrong. So please do watch them, won't you, dear? And look out for Mr. Logan. I do hope-- she paused with a look of worried abstraction in her eyes.",1
3781,"You do hope what?"" he said pointedly, with just the suggestion of an ironic grin round the corners of his mouth. I do hope he won't""--she began in a troubled tone, then went on rapidly--""He said something about--about clearing away some of the things in the living-room for his show. She looked at him rather helplessly; then, catching the irony of his faint grin, she coloured quickly and laughed richly. God! I don't know what he's going to do. He brought enough stuff with him to sink a battleship!...Still, I suppose it's going to be all right. Everyone's been after him, you know. Everyone's thrilled at the chance of seeing him. Oh, I'm sure it'll be all right. Don't you think so--hah?""  She looked earnestly at him with an expression of such droll, beseeching inquiry that, unmasked for a moment, he laughed abruptly as he turned away, saying:  ""Oh, I suppose so, Esther.",1
3782,"I'll look after it. Mrs. Jack went on down the hall, pausing just perceptibly as she passed her daughter's door. She could hear the girl's voice, clear, cool, and young, humming the jaunty strains of a popular tune:  ""You're the cream in my coffee--you're the salt in my stew-w----""  A little smile of love and tenderness suffused the woman's face as she continued down the hall and entered the next door, which was her own room.",1
3783,"It was a very simple, lovely room, hauntingly chaste, almost needlessly austere. In the centre of one wall stood her narrow little wooden bed, so small and plain and old that it seemed it might almost have served as the bed of a medieval nun, as perhaps it had. Beside it stood the little table with its few books, a telephone, a glass and a silver pitcher, and in a silver frame a photograph of a girl in her early twenties--Mrs. Jack's daughter, Alma.",1
3784,"Beside the door as one entered there was an enormous old wooden wardrobe, which she had brought from Italy. This contained all her beautiful dresses and her wonderful collection of winglike little shoes, all of them made by hand to fit her perfect little feet. On the opposite wall, facing the door, between two high windows, stood her writing-desk. Between the bed and the windows there was a small drawing-table. It was a single board of white, perfect wood, and on it, arranged with faultless precision, were a dozen sharpened pencils, a few feathery brushes, some crisp sheets of tracing paper on which geometric designs were legible, a pot of paste, a ruler, and a little jar of golden paint. Exactly above this table, hanging from the wall in all the clean beauty of their strength and accuracy, were a triangle and a square.",1
3785,"At the foot of the bed there was a chaise-longue covered with a flowered pattern of old faded silk. There were a few simple drawings, on the walls, and a single painting of a strange, exotic flower. It was such a flower as never was, a dream flower which Mrs. Jack had painted long ago.",1
3786,"Along the wall opposite the bed stood two old chests. One of them, a product of the Pennsylvania Dutch, was carved and coloured in quaint and cheerful patterns, and this contained old silks and laces and the noble Indian saris which she often loved to wear. The other was an old chest of drawers, with a few silver toilet articles and a square mirror on its top.",1
3787,"Mrs. Jack crossed the room and stood before the mirror looking at herself. First she bent forward a little and stared at her face long and earnestly with an expression of childlike innocence. Then she began to turn about, regarding herself from first one angle, then another. She put her hand up to her temple and smoothed her brow. Obviously she found herself good, for her eyes now took on an expression of rapt complacency. There was open vanity in her look as she brooded with smouldering fascination on the thick bracelet around her arm--a rich and sombre chain of ancient India, studded with dull and curious gems. She lifted her chin and looked at her neck,, tracing out with her finger-tips the design of an old necklace which she wore. She surveyed her smooth arms, her bare back, her gleaming shoulders, and the outlines of her breasts and figure, touching, patting, and half-unconsciously arranging with practiced touches the folds of her simple, splendid gown.",1
3788,"She lifted her arm again and with hand extended, the other hand upon her hip, she turned about once more in her orbit of self-worship. Slowly she turned, still rapt in contemplation of her loveliness, then she gasped suddenly with surprise and fright, and uttered a little scream. Her hand flew to her throat in a gesture of alarm as she realised that she was not alone and, looking up, saw her daughter standing there.",1
3789,"The girl, young, slender, faultless, cold, and lovely, had entered through the bathroom that connected the two rooms, and was standing in the door, having paused there, frozen to immobility as she caught her mother in the act. The mother's face went blood-red. For a long moment the two women looked at each other, the mother utterly confused and crimson with her guilt, the daughter cold and appraising with the irony of sophisticated mirth. Then something quick and instant passed between them in their glance.",1
3790,"Like one who has been discovered and who knows that there is nothing more to say, the mother suddenly threw back her head and laughed, a rich, full-throated, woman's yell of free acknowledgement, unknown to the race of man. Well, Mother, was it good?"" said the girl, now grinning faintly. She walked over and kissed her.",1
3791,"Again the mother was shaken with her hysteria of helpless laughter. Then both of them, freed from the necessity of argument by that all-taking moment, were calm again. Thus was enacted the whole tremendous comedy of womankind. No words were needed. There was nothing left to say. All had been said there in that voiceless instant of complete and utter understanding, of mutual recognition and conspiracy. The whole universe of sex had been nakedly revealed for just the flick of a second in all its guile and its overwhelming humour. And the great city roared on unwittingly round that secret cell, and no man in its many millions was any the wiser about this primal force more strong than cities and as old as earth.",1
3792,"15. The Party at Jack's Now the guests were beginning to arrive. The electric thring of the door-bell broke sharply and persistently on accustomed quietness. People were coming in and filling the place with the ease and familiarity of old friends. In the hallway and in the rooms at the front there arose now a confused medley of many voices--the rippling laughter and quick, excited tones of the women mingled with the deeper, more vibrant sonorities of the men. It was a mixture smooth as oil, which fused and mounted steadily. With every sharp ringing of the bell, with every opening and closing of the door, there were new voices and new laughter, a babel of new greetings, new gaiety, and new welcomes.",1
3793,"The whole place--all the rooms front to back--was now thrown open to the party. In the hall, in the bedrooms, in the great living-room, and in the dining-room, people were moving in and out, circulating everywhere in beautiful and spontaneous patterns. Women were coming up to Mrs. Jack and embracing her with the affectionate tenderness of old friendship. Men, drawn together in solemn discussion or in the jesting interplay of wit, were going in and out of Mr. Jack's room.",1
3794,"Mrs. Jack, her eyes sparkling with joy, was moving about everywhere, greeting people and stopping to talk to everyone. Her whole manner had a quality of surprised delight, as of a person who feels that wonders will never cease. Although she had invited all these people, she seemed, as she spoke to each in turn, as if she was taken aback by the happiness of an unexpected and unhoped-for encounter with an old friend whom she had not seen for a long time. Her voice, as she talked, grew a trifle higher with its excitement, even at times a little shrill, and her face glowed with pleasure. And her guests smiled at her as people smile at a happy and excited child.",1
3795,"Many were moving about now with glasses in their hands. Some were leaning against walls talking to each other. Distinguished-looking men were propped with their elbows on the mantel in the casual earnestness of debate. Beautiful women with satiny backs were moving through the crowd with velvet undulance. The young people were gathered together in little parties of their own, drawn to one another by the magic of their youth. Everywhere people were laughing and chattering, bending to fill glasses with frosty drinks, or moving around the loaded temptations of the dining-table and the great buffet with that ""choosy"" look, somewhat perturbed and doubtful, which said plainly that they would like to taste it all but knew they couldn't. And the smiling maids were there to do their bidding, and to urge them to have just a little more. All in all, it was a wonderful scene of white and black and gold and power and wealth and loveliness and food and drink.",1
3796,"Mrs. Jack glanced happily through the crowded rooms. It was, she knew, a notable assemblage of the best, the highest, and the fairest the city had to offer. And others were arriving all the time. At this moment, in fact, Miss Lily Mandell came in, and the tall, smouldering beauty swung away along the hall to dispose of her wraps. She was followed almost at once by Mr. Lawrence Hirsch, the banker. He casually gave his coat and hat to one of the maids, and, groomed and faultless, schooled in power, be bowed greetings through the throng towards his hostess. He shook hands with her and kissed her lightly on one cheek, saying with that cool irony that was a portion of the city style:  ""You haven't looked so lovely, darling, since the days when we used to dance the can-can together.",1
3797,"Then, polished and imperturbable, he turned away--a striking figure. His abundant hair was prematurely white, and, strangely, it gave to his clear and clean-shaven face a look of almost youthful maturity. His features, a little worn but assured, were vested in unconscious arrogance with the huge authorities of wealth. He moved, this weary, able son of man, among the crowd and took his place, assuming, without knowing he assumed, his full authorities.",1
3798,"Lily Mandell now returned to the big room and made her way languidly towards Mrs. Jack. This heiress of Midas wealth was tall and dark, with a shock of black hair. Her face, with its heavy-lidded eyes, was full of pride and sleepy eloquence. She was a stunning woman, and everything about her was a little startling. The dress she wore was a magnificent gown fashioned from a single piece of dull golden cloth, and had been so designed to display her charms that her tall, voluptuous figure seemed literally to have been poured into it. It made her a miracle of statuesque beauty, and as she swayed along with sleepy undulance, the eyes of all the men were turned upon her. She bent over the smaller figure of her hostess, kissed her, and, in a rich, yolky voice full of genuine affection, said:  ""Darling, how are you?""  By now, Herbert, the elevator boy, was being kept so busy bringing up new arrivals that one group hardly had time to finish with its greetings before the door would open and a new group would come in.",1
3799,"There was Roderick Hale, the distinguished lawyer. Then Miss Roberta Heilprinn arrived with Mr. Samuel Fetzer. These two were old friends of Mrs. Jack's ""in the theatre"", and her manner towards them, while not more cordial or affectionate than that towards her other guests, was a shade more direct and casual. It was as if one of those masks--not of pretending but of formal custom--which life imposes upon so many human relations had here keen sloughed off. She said simply: ""Oh, hello, Bertie. Hello, Sam. The shade indefinable told everything: they were ""show people""--she and they had ""worked together"".",1
3800,"There were a good many show people. Two young actors from the Community Guild Theatre escorted the Misses Hattie Warren and Bessie Lane, both of them grey-haired spinsters who were directors of the theatre. And, in addition to the more gifted and distinguished people, there were a number of the lesser fry, too. There was a young girl who was understudy to a dancer at one of the repertory theatres, and another woman who was the seamstress and wardrobe mistress there, and still another who had once been Mrs. Jack's assistant in her own work. For, as success and fame had come to Mrs. Jack, she had not forgotten her old friends. Though she was now a celebrity herself, she had thus escaped the banal and stereotyped existence that so many celebrities achieve. She loved life too well to cut herself off from the common run of warm humanity. In her own youth she had known sorrow, insecurity, hardship, heartbreak, and disillusion, and she had never forgotten it. Nor had she forgotten any of the people her life had ever touched. She had a rare talent for loyal and abiding friendships, and most of the people who were here to-night, even the most famous ones, were friends who she had known for many years, some of them since childhood.",1
3801,"Among the guests who now came streaming in was a mild, sad-faced woman named Margaret Ettinger. She was married to a profligate husband and had brought him with her. And he, John Ettinger, had brought along a buxom young woman who was his current mistress. This trio provided the most bizarre and unpleasantly disturbing touch to an otherwise distinguished gathering.",1
3802,"The guests were still arriving as fast as the elevator could bring them up. Stephen Hook came in with his sister, Mary, and greeted his hostess by holding out to her a frail, limp hand. At the same time he turned half away from her with an air of exaggerated boredom and indifference, an almost weary disdain, as he murmured:",1
3803,"Oh, hello, Esther...Look""--he half-turned towards her again, almost as if this were an afterthought--""I brought you this. He handed her a book and turned away again. I thought it was rather interesting,"" he said in a bored tone. You might like to look at it. What he had given her was a magnificent volume of Peter Breughel's drawings--a volume that she knew well, and the cost of which had frightened even her.",1
3804,"She looked quickly at the flyleaf and saw that in his fine hand he had written primly: ""For Esther--from Stephen Hook"". And suddenly she remembered that she had mentioned to him casually, a week or two before, her interest in this book, and she understood now that this act, which in a characteristic way he was trying to conceal under a mask of laboured indifference, had come swift and shining as a beam of light out of the depths of the man's fine and generous spirit. Her face burned crimson, something choked her in the throat, and her eyes grew hot with tears.",1
3805,"Oh, Steve!"" she gasped. This is simply the most beautiful--the most wonderful----""  He seemed fairly to shrink away from her. His white, flabby face took on an expression of disdainful boredom that was so exaggerated it would have seemed comical if it had not been for the look of naked pleading in his hazel eyes. It was the look of a proud, noble, strangely twisted and tormented man--the look almost of a frightened child, who, even while it shrank away from the companionship and security it so desperately needed and wanted, was also pleading pitifully: ""For God's sake, help me if you can! I am afraid!",1
3806,"She saw that look in his eyes as he turned pompously away from her, and it went through her like a knife. In a flash of stabbing pity she felt the wonder, the strangeness, and the miracle of living. Oh, you poor tormented creature,"" she was thinking. What is wrong with you? What are you afraid of? What's eating on you anyway?...What a strange man he is! she thought more tranquilly. And how fine and good and high! At this moment, as if reading her own thoughts, her daughter, Alma, came to the rescue.",1
3807,"Cool, poised, lovely, the girl came across the room, moved up to Hook, and said casually:  ""Oh, hello, Steve. Can I get you a drink?""  The question was a godsend. He was extremely fond of the girl. He liked her polished style, her elegance, her friendly yet perfectly impenetrable manner. It gave him just the foil, the kind of protection, that he so desperately needed. He answered her at once.",1
3808,"What you have to say quite fascinates me,"" he murmured in a bored tone and moved over to the mantel, where he leaned as spectator and turned his face three-quarters away from the room, as if the sight of so many appallingly dull people was more than he could endure. The elaborately mannered indirection of his answer was completely characteristic of Stephen Hook, and provided a key to his literary style. He was the author of a great many stories, which he sold to magazines to support himself and his mother, and also of several very fine books. The books had established his considerable and deserved reputation, but they had had almost no sale. As he himself had ironically pointed out, almost everyone, apparently, had read his books and no one had bought them. In these books, just as in his social manner, he tried to mask his shyness and timidity by an air of weary disdain and by the intricate artifice and circumlocution of an elaborately mannered style.",1
3809,"Mrs. Jack, after staring rather helplessly at Hook, turned to his sister, a jolly-faced spinster with twinkling eyes and an infectious laugh who shared her brother's charm but lacked his tormented spirit, and whispered:  ""What's wrong with Steve to-night? He looks as if he's been seeing ghosts. No--just another monster,"" Mary Hook replied, and laughed.",1
3810,"He had a pimple on his nose last week and he stared at it so much in the mirror that he became convinced it was a tumour. Mother was almost crazy. He locked himself in his room and refused to come out or talk to anyone for days and days. Four days ago he sent her a note leaving minute instructions for his funeral and burial--he has a horror of being cremated. Three days ago he came out in his pyjamas and said good-bye to all of us. He said his life was overall was ended. To-night he thought better of it and decided to dress and come to your party. Mary Hook laughed again good-naturedly and, with a humorous shrug and a shake of her head, moved away into the crowd.",1
3811,"And Mrs. Jack, still with a rather troubled look on her face, turned to talk to old Jake Abramson, who had been holding her hand and gently stroking it during the last part of this puzzled interlude. The mark of the fleshpots was plain upon Jake Abramson. He was old, subtle, sensual, weary, and he had the face of a vulture. Curiously enough, it was also a strangely attractive face. It had so much patience in it, and a kind of wise cynicism, and a weary humour. There was something paternal and understanding about him. He looked like an immensely old and tired ambassador of life who had lived so long, and seen so much, and been so many places, that even his evening clothes were as habitual as his breath and hung on him with a weary and accustomed grace as if he had been born in them.",1
3812,"He had taken off his top-coat and his silk hat and given them to the maid, and then had come wearily into the room towards Mrs. Jack. He was evidently very fond of her. While she had been talking to Mary Hook he had remained silent and had brooded above her like a benevolent vulture. He smiled beneath his great nose and kept his eyes intently on her face; then he took her small hand in his weary old clasp and began to stroke her smooth arm. It was a gesture frankly old and sensual, jaded, and yet strangely fatherly and gentle. It was the gesture of a man who had known and possessed many pretty women and who still knew how to admire and appreciate them, but whose stronger passions had now passed over into a paternal benevolence.",1
3813,"And in the same way he now spoke to her. You're looking nice! he said. You're looking pretty! He kept smiling vulturesquely at her and stroking her arm. Just like a rose she is! the old man said, and never took his weary eyes from her face.",1
3814,"Oh, Jake!"" she cried excitedly and in a surprised tone, as if she had not known before that he was there. How nice of you to come! I didn't know you were back. I thought you were still in Europe. I've been and went,"" he declared humorously.",1
3815,"You're looking awfully well, Jake,"" she said. The trip did you lots of good. You've lost weight. You took the cure at Carlsbad, didn't you?""  ""I didn't take the cure,"" the old man solemnly declared, ""I took the die-ett.",1
3816,"Deliberately he mispronounced the word. Instantly Mrs. Jack's face was suffused with crimson and her shoulders began to shake hysterically. She turned to Roberta Heilprinn, seized her helplessly by the arm, and clung to her, shrieking faintly:  ""God!",1
3817,"Did you hear him? He's been on a diet! I bet it almost killed him! The way he loves to eat!""  Miss Heilprinn chuckled fruitily and her oil-smooth features widened in such a large grin that her eyes contracted to closed slits.",1
3818,"I've been die-etting ever since I went away,"" said Jake. I was sick when I went away--and I came back on an English boat,"" the old man said with a melancholy and significant leer that drew a scream of laughter from the two women. Oh, Jake!"" cried Mrs. Jack hilariously. How you must have suffered! I know what you used to think of English food!""  ""I think the same as I always did,"" the old man said with resigned sadness--""only ten times more!",1
3819,"She shrieked again, then gasped out, ""Brussels sprouts?""  ""They still got 'em,"" said old Jake solemnly. They still got the same ones they had ten years ago. I saw Brussels sprouts this last trip that ought to be in the British Museum... And they still got that good fish,"" he went on with a suggestive leer.",1
3820,"Roberta Heilprinn, her bland features grinning like a Buddha, gurgled: ""The Dead Sea fruit?""  ""No,"" said old Jake sadly, ""not the Dead Sea fruit--that ain't dead enough. They got boiled flannel now,"" he said, ""and that good sauce!... You remember that good sauce they used to make? He leered at Mrs. Jack with an air of such insinuation that she was again set off in a fit of shuddering hysteria:  ""You mean that awful...tasteless...pasty...goo...about the colour of a dead lemon?",1
3821,"You got it,"" the old man nodded his wise and tired old head in weary agreement. You got it... That's it... They still make it... So I've been die-etting all the way back! For the first time his tired old voice showed a trace of animation. Carlsbad wasn't in it compared to the die-etting I had to do on the English boat! He paused, then with a glint of cynic humour in his weary eyes, he said: ""It was fit for nothing but a bunch of goys!",1
3822,"This reference to unchosen tribes, with its evocation of humorous contempt, now snapped a connection between these three people, and suddenly one saw them in a new way. The old man was smiling thinly, with a cynical intelligence, and the two women were shaken utterly by a paroxysm of understanding mirth. One saw now that they really were together, able, ancient, immensely knowing, and outside the world, regardant, tribal, communitied in derision and contempt for the unhallowed, unsuspecting tribes of lesser men who were not party to their knowing, who were not folded to their seal. It passed--the instant showing of their ancient sign. The women just smiled now, quietly: they were citizens of the world again.",1
3823,"But Jake! You poor fellow! Mrs. Jack said sympathetically. You must have hated it! Then she cried suddenly and enthusiastically as she remembered: ""Isn't Carlsbad just too beautiful?...Did you know that Bert and I were there one time? As she uttered these words she slipped her hand affectionately through the arm of her friend, Roberta, then went on vigorously, with a jolly laugh and a merry face: ""Didn't I ever tell you about that time, Jake?...Really, it was the most wonderful experience!...But God! she laughed almost explosively--""Will you ever forget the first three or four days, Bert? She appealed to her smiling friend. Do you remember how hungry we got? How we thought we couldn't possibly hold out? Wasn't it dreadful? she said, and then went on with a serious and rather puzzled air as she tried to explain it: ""But then--I don't know--it's funny--but somehow you get used to it, don't you, Bert? The first few days are pretty awful, but after that you don't seem to mind. I guess you get too weak, or something... I know Bert and I stayed in bed three weeks--and really it wasn't bad after the first few days. She laughed suddenly, richly. We used to try to torture each other by making up enormous menus of the most delicious food we knew. We had it all planned out to go to a swell restaurant the moment our cure was over and order the biggest meal we could think of!... Well! she laughed--""would you believe it?--the day the cure was finished and the doctor told us it would be all right for us to get up and eat--I know we both lay there for hours thinking of all the things we were going to have. It was simply wonderful! she said, laughing and making a fine little movement with her finger and her thumb to indicate great delicacy, her voice squeaking like a child's and her eyes wrinkling up to dancing points. In all your life you never heard of such delicious food as Bert and I were going to devour! We resolved to do everything in the greatest style!... Well, at last we got up and dressed. And God! she cried. We were so weak we could hardly stand up, but we wore the prettiest clothes we had, and we had chartered a Rolls Royce for the occasion and a chauffeur in livery! In all your days,"" she cried with her eyes twinkling, ""you've never seen such swank! We got into the car and were driven away like a couple of queens. We told the man to drive us to the swellest, most expensive restaurant he knew. He took us to a beautiful place outside of town. It looked like a chateau! She beamed rosily round her. And when they saw us coming they must have thought we were royalty from the way they acted. The flunkies were lined up, bowing and scraping, for half a block. Oh, it was thrilling! Everything we'd gone through and endured in taking the cure seemed worth it... Well! she looked round her and the breath left her body audibly in a sigh of complete frustration--""would you believe it?--when we got in there and tried to eat we could hardly swallow a bite! We had looked forward to it so long--we had planned it all so carefully--and all we could eat was a soft-boiled egg--and we couldn't even finish that! It filled us up right to here--"" she put a small hand level with her chin. It was so tragic that we almost wept!...Isn't it a strange thing? I guess it must be that your stomach shrinks up while you're on the diet. You lie there day after day and think of the enormous meal you are going to devour just as soon as you get up--and then when you try it you're not even able to finish a soft-boiled egg!",1
3824,"As she finished, Mrs. Jack shrugged her shoulders and lifted her hands questioningly, with such a comical look on her face that everybody round her laughed. Even weary and jaded old Jake Abramson, who had really paid no attention to what she was saying but had just been regarding her with his fixed smile during the whole course of her animated dialogue, now smiled a little more warmly as he turned away to speak to other friends. Miss Heilprinn and Mrs. Jack, left standing together in the centre of the big room, offered an instructive comparison in the capacities of their sex. Each woman was perfectly cast in her own role. Each had found the perfect adaptive means by which she could utilise her full talents with the least waste and friction.",1
3825,"Miss Heilprinn looked the very distinguished woman that she was. Hers was the talent of the administrator, the ability to get things done, and one knew at a glance that in the rough and tumble of practical affairs this bland lady was more than a match for any man. She suggested oil--smooth oil, oil of tremendous driving power and generating force.",1
3826,"Along Broadway she had reigned for years as the governing brain of a celebrated art theatre, and her business acuity had wrung homage even from her enemies. It had been her function to promote, to direct, to control, and in the tenuous and uncertain speculations of the theatre to take care not to be fleeced by the wolves of Broadway. The brilliance of her success, the power of her will, and the superior quality of her metal were written plain upon her. It took no very experienced observer to see that in the unequal contest between Miss Heilprinn and the wolves of Broadway it had been the wolves who had been worsted.",1
3827,"In that savage and unremitting warfare, which arouses such bitter passions and undying hatreds that eyes become jaundiced and lips so twisted that they are never afterwards able to do anything but writhe like yellowed scars on haggard faces, had Miss Heilprinn's face grown hard? Had her mouth contracted to a grim line? Had her jaw out-jutted like a granite crag? Were the marks of the wars visible anywhere upon her? Not at all. The more murderous the fight, the blander her face. The more treacherous the intrigues in which Broadway's life involved her, the more mellow became the fruity lilt of her good-humoured chuckle. She had actually thriven on it. Indeed, as one of her colleagues said: ""Roberta never seems so happy and so unconsciously herself as when she is playing about in a nest of rattlesnakes.",1
3828,"So, now, as she stood there talking to Mrs. Jack, she presented a very handsome and striking appearance. Her grey hair was combed in a pompadour, and her suave and splendid gown gave the finishing touch to her general air of imperturbable assurance. Her face was almost impossibly bland, but it was a blandness without hypocrisy. Nevertheless, one saw that her twinkling eyes, which narrowed into such jolly slits when she smiled, were sharp as flint and missed nothing.",1
3829,"In a curious way, Mrs. Jack was a more complex person than her smooth companion. She was essentially not less shrewd, not less accomplished, not less subtle, and not less determined to secure her own ends in this hard world, but her strategy had been different. Most people thought her ""such a romantic person"". As her friends said, she was ""so beautiful"", she was ""such a child"", she was ""so good"". Yes, she was all these things. For she had early learned the advantages of possessing a rosy, jolly little face and a manner of slightly bewildered surprise and naive innocence. When she smiled doubtfully yet good-naturedly at her friends, it was as if to say: ""Now I know you're laughing at me, aren't you? I don't know what it is. I don't know what I've done or said now. Of course I'm not clever the way you are--all of you are so frightfully smart-- but anyway I have a good time, and I like you all. To many people that was the essential Mrs. Jack.",1
3830,"Only a few knew that there was a great deal more to her than met the eye. The bland lady who now stood talking to her was one of these. Miss Roberta Heilprinn missed no artifice of that almost unconsciously deceptive innocence. And perhaps that is why, when Mrs. Jack finished her anecdote and looked at old Jake Abramson so comically and questioningly, Miss Heilprinn's eye twinkled a little brighter, her Buddhistic smile became a little smoother, and her yolky chuckle grew a trifle more infectious. Perhaps that is also why, with a sudden impulse of understanding and genuine affection, Miss Heilprinn bent and kissed the glowing little cheek.",1
3831,"And the object of this caress, although she never changed her expression of surprised and delighted innocence, knew full well all that was going on in the other woman's mind. For just a moment, almost imperceptibly, the eyes of the two women, stripped bare of all concealing artifice, met each other. And in that moment there was matter for Olympian laughter.",1
3832,"While Mrs. Jack welcomed her friends and beamed with happiness, one part of her mind remained aloof and preoccupied. For someone was still absent, and she kept thinking of him. I wonder where he is,"" she thought. Why doesn't he come? I hope he hasn't been drinking. She looked quickly over the brilliant gathering with a troubled eye and thought impatiently: ""If only he liked parties more! If only he enjoyed meeting people--going out in the evening! Oh, well--he's the way he is. It's no use trying to change him. I wouldn't have him any different.",1
3833,"And then he arrived. Here he is! she thought excitedly, looking at him with instant relief. And he's all right!""  George Webber had, in fact, taken two or three stiff drinks before he left his rooms, in preparation for the ordeal.",1
3834,"The raw odour of cheap gin hung on his breath, his eyes were slightly bright and wild, and his manner was quick and a trifle more feverish than was his wont. Just the same he was, as Esther had phrased it to herself, ""all right"". If only people--my friends--everyone I know--didn't affect him so,"" she thought. Why is it, I wonder. Last night when he telephoned me he talked so strange! Nothing he said made any sense! What could have been wrong with him? Oh, well--it doesn't matter now. He's here. I love him! Her face warmed and softened, her pulse beat quicker, and she went to meet him.",1
3835,"Oh, hello, darling,"" she said fondly. I'm so glad you're here at last. I was beginning to be afraid you were going to fail me after all. He greeted her half fondly and half truculently, with a mixture of diffidence and pugnacity, of arrogance and humility, of pride, of hope, of love, of suspicion, of eagerness, of doubt.",1
3836,"He had not wanted to come to the party at all. From the moment she had first invited him he had brought forward a barrage of objections. They had argued it back and forth for days, but at last she had won and had exacted his promise. But as the time approached he felt himself hesitating again, and last night he had paced the floor for hours in an agony of self-recrimination and indecision. At last, around one o'clock, he had seized the telephone with desperate resolve and, after waking the whole household before he got her, he had told her that he was not coming. Once more he repeated all his reasons. He only half-understood them himself, but they had to do with the incompatibility of her world and his world, and his belief, which was as much a matter of instinctive feeling as of conscious thought, that he must keep his independence of the world she belonged to if he was to do his work. He grew almost desperate as he tried to explain it to her, because he couldn't seem to make her understand what he was driving at. In the end she became a little desperate, too. First she was annoyed, and told him for God's sake to stop being such a fool. Then she became hurt and angry and reminded him of his promise.",1
3837,"We've been over all of this a dozen times! she said shrilly, and there was also a tearful note in her voice. You promised, George--you know you did! And now everything's arranged. It's too late to change it now. You can't let me down like this!""  This appeal was too much for him.",1
3838,"He knew, of course, that the party had not been planned for him and that no arrangements would be upset if he failed to appear. No one but Esther would even be aware of his absence. But he had given his promise to come, however reluctantly, and he saw that the only issue he had succeeded in raising in her mind was the simple one of whether he would keep his word. So once more, and finally, he had yielded. And now he was here, full of confusion, and wishing with all his heart that he was anywhere else.",1
3839,"I'm sure you're going to have a good time,"" Esther was saying to him eagerly. You'll see--"" and she squeezed his hand. There are lots of people I want you to meet. But you must be hungry. Better get yourself something to eat first. You'll find plenty of things you like. I planned them especially for you. Go in the dining-room and help yourself. I'll have to stay here a little while to welcome all these people. After she left him to greet some new arrivals, George stood there awkwardly for a moment with a scowl on his face and glanced about the room at the dazzling assemblage.",1
3840,"In that attitude he cut a rather grotesque figure. The low brow with its frame of short black hair, the burning eyes, the small, packed features, the long arms dangling to the knees, and the curved paws gave him an appearance more simian than usual, and the image was accentuated by his not-too-well-fitting dinner jacket. People looked at him and stared, then turned away indifferently and resumed their conversations.",1
3841,"So! he thought with somewhat truculent self-consciousness--""These are her fine friends! I might have known it! he muttered to himself, without knowing at all what it was he might have known. The poise, assurance, and sophistication of all these sleek faces made him fancy a slight where none was offered or intended. I'll show them! he growled absurdly beneath his breath, not having the faintest idea what he meant by that.",1
3842,"With this, he turned upon his heel and threaded his way through the brilliant throng towards the dining-room. I mean!...You know!... At the sound of the words, eager, rapid, uttered in a rather hoarse yet strangely seductive tone of voice, Mrs. Jack smiled at the group to whom she had been talking.",1
3843,"There's Amy! she said. Then, as she turned and saw the elflike head with its unbelievable harvest of ebony curls, the snub nose and the little freckles, and the lovely face so radiant with an almost boyish quality of animation and enthusiasm, she thought:  ""Isn't she beautiful!",1
3844,"And--and--there is something so sweet, so--so good about her!""  Even as her mind framed its spontaneous tribute to the girlish apparition with the elflike head, Mrs. Jack knew that it was not true. No; Amy Carleton was many things, but no one could call her good. In fact, if she was not ""a notorious woman"", the reason was that she had surpassed the ultimate limits of notoriety, even for New York. Everybody knew her, and knew all about her, yet what the truth was, or what the true image of that lovely counterfeit of youth and joy, no one could say.  Chronology?",1
3845,"Well, for birth she had had the golden spoon. She had been born to enfabled wealth. Hers had been the childhood of a dollar princess, kept, costly, cabined, pruned, confined. A daughter of ""Society"", her girlhood had been spent in rich schools and in travel, in Europe, Southampton, New York, and Palm Beach. By eighteen she was ""out""--a famous beauty. By nineteen she was married. And by twenty she was divorced, her name tainted. It had been a sensational case which fairly reeked. Even at that time her conduct had been so scandalous that her husband had had no difficulty in winning a decree.",1
3846,"Since that time, seven years before, her career had defied the measurements of chronology. Although she was now only in her middle twenties, her life seemed to go back through aeons of iniquity. Thus one might remember one of the innumerable scandals that had been connected with her name, and then check oneself suddenly with a feeling of stunned disbelief. Oh, no! It can't be! That happened only three short years ago, and since then she's--why she's--"" And one would stare in stupefaction at that elflike head, that snub nose, that boyishly eager face, like one who realised that he was looking at the dread Medusa, or at some enchantress of Circean cunning whose life was older than the ages and whose heart was old as hell.",1
3847,"It baffled time, it turned reality to phantasmal shapes. One could behold her as she was to-night, here in New York, this freckled, laughing image of happy innocence--and before ten days had made their round one might come upon her again in the corruptest gatherings of Paris, drugged fathoms deep in opium, foul-bodied and filth-bespattered, cloying in the embraces of a gutter rat, so deeply rooted in the cesspool that it seemed she must have been bred on sewage and had never known any other life. Since her first marriage and divorce, she had been married twice again. The second marriage had lasted only twenty hours, and had been annulled. The third had ended when her husband shot himself.",1
3848,"And before and after that, and in between, and in and out, and during it and later on, and now and then, and here and there, and at home and abroad, and on the seven seas, and across the length and breadth of the five continents, and yesterday and to-morrow and for ever--could it be said of her that she had been promiscuous? No, that could not be said of her. For she had been as free as air, and one does not qualify the general atmosphere with such a paltry adjective as ""promiscuous"". She had just slept with everybody--with white, black, yellow, pink, green, or purple--but she had never been promiscuous.",1
3849,"It was, in romantic letters, a period that celebrated the lady who was lost, the lovely creature in the green hat who was ""never let off anything"". Her story was a familiar one: she was the ill-starred heroine of fate, a martyr to calamitous mischance, whose ruin had been brought about through tragic circumstances which she could not control, and for which she was not responsible. Amy Carleton had her apologists who tried to cast her in this role. The stories told about her ""start upon the downward path"" were numerous. One touching version dated the beginning of the end from the time when, an innocent and fun-loving girl of eighteen, she had, in a moment of daring, lighted a cigarette at a dinner party in Southampton, attended by a large number of eminent dowagers. The girl's downfall, according to this tale, had been brought about by this thoughtless and harmless little act. From that moment on--so the story went--the verdict of the dowagers was ""thumbs down"" on Amy. The evil tongues began to wag, scandal began to grow, her reputation was torn to shreds. Then, in desperation, the unhappy child did go astray: she took to drink, from drink to lovers, from lovers to opium, from opium to--everything.",1
3850,"All this, of course, was just romantic nonsense. She was the victim of a tragic doom indeed, but she herself had fashioned it. With her the fault, as with dear Brutus, lay not in her stars, but in herself. For, having been endowed with so many rare and precious things that most men lack--wealth, beauty, charm, intelligence, and vital energy--she lacked the will, the toughness, to resist. So, having almost all, but lacking this, she was the slave to her advantages. Her wealth had set a premium on every whim, and no one had ever taught her to say no.",1
3851,"In this she was the child of her own time. Her life expressed itself in terms of speed, sensational change, and violent movement, in a feverish tempo that never drew from its own energies exhaustion or surcease, but mounted constantly to insane excess. She had been everywhere and ""seen everything""--in the way one might see things from the windows of an express train travelling eighty miles an hour. And, having quickly exhausted the conventional kaleidoscope of things to be seen, she had long since turned to an investigation of things more bizarre and sinister and hidden. Here, too, her wealth and powerful connections opened doors to her which were closed to other people.",1
3852,"So, now, she possessed an intimate and extensive acquaintance among the most sophisticated and decadent groups in ""Society"", in all the great cities of the world. And her cult of the unusual had led to an exploration of the most shadowy border lines of life. She had an acquaintanceship among the underworld of New York, London, Paris, and Berlin which the police might have envied. And even with the police her wealth had secured for her dangerous privileges. In some way, known only to persons who control great power, financial or political, she had obtained a police card and was privileged to a reckless licence in the operation of her low-slung racing car. Although she was near-sighted, she drove it at murderous speed through the seething highways of Manhattan, and as it flashed by she always got the courtesy of a police salute. All this in spite of the fact that she had demolished one car and killed a young man who had been driving with her, and in spite of the further fact that the police knew her as one who had been present at a drinking party at which one of the chieftains of the underworld had been slain.",1
3853,"It seemed, therefore, that her wealth and power and feverish energy could get her anything she wanted in any country of the world. People had once said: ""What on earth is Amy going to do next! But now they said: ""What on earth is there left for her to do? If life is to be expressed solely in terms of velocity and sensation, it seemed there was nothing left for her to do. Nothing but more speed, more change, more violence, more sensation--until the end. And the end? The end could only be destruction, and the mark of destruction was already apparent upon her. It was written in her eyes--in her tormented, splintered, and exploded vision. She had tried everything in life--except living. And she could never try that now because she had so long ago, and so irrevocably, lost the way. So there was nothing left for her to do except to die.",1
3854,"If only""--people would think regretfully, as Mrs. Jack now thought as she looked at that elfin head--""oh, if only things had turned out differently for her!""--and then would seek back desperately through the labyrinthine scheme to find the clue to her disorder, saying: ""Here--or here--or here--it happened here, you see!--If Only--! If only men were so much clay, as they are blood, bone, marrow, passion, feeling! If they only were!  ""I mean!...You know!...",1
3855,"With these words, so indicative of her undefined enthusiasm and inchoate thought, Amy jerked the cigarette away from her lips, laughed hoarsely and eagerly, and turned to her companions as if fairly burning with a desire to communicate to them something that filled her with exuberant elation. I mean! she cried again--""when you compare it with the stuff they're doing nowadays!--I mean!--there's simply no comparison! Laughing jubilantly, as if the thought behind these splintered phrases must be perfectly clear to everyone, she drew furiously upon her cigarette again and jerked it from her lips.",1
3856,"The group of, young people of which Amy was the radiant centre, and which included not only the young Japanese who was her current lover but also the young Jew who had been his most recent predecessor, had moved over towards the portrait of Mrs. Jack above the mantel, and were looking up at it. The portrait deserved the praise that was now being heaped upon it. It was one of the best examples of Henry Mallows' early work.",1
3857,"When you look at it and think how long ago that was!""--cried Amy jubilantly, gesturing towards the picture with rapid thrusts of her cigarette--""and how beautiful she was then!--and how beautiful she is now! she cried exultantly, laughed hoarsely, then cast her grey-green eyes round her in a glance of feverish exasperation--""I mean!""--she cried again, and drew impatiently on her cigarette--""there's simply no comparison! Then, realising that she had not said what she had wanted to say, she went on: ""Oh, I mean!""--she said in a tone almost of desperation and tossed her cigarette angrily away into the blazing fire--""the whole thing's obvious! she muttered, leaving everyone more bewildered than before. With a sudden and impulsive movement she turned towards Stephen Hook, who was still leaning with his elbow on one corner of the mantel, and demanded: ""How long has it been, Steve?... I mean!--it's been twenty years ago, hasn't it?""  ""Oh, quite all of that,"" Hook answered in his cold, bored voice.",1
3858,"In his agitation and embarrassment he moved still farther away until he almost had his back turned upon the group. It's been nearer thirty, I should think,"" he tossed back over his shoulder, and then with an air of casual indifference he gave the date. I should think it was done in nineteen-one or two--wasn't it, Esther?"" he said, turning to Mrs. Jack, who had now approached the group. Around nineteen-one, wasn't it?""  ""What's that?"" said Mrs. Jack, and then went on immediately, ""Oh, the picture!",1
3859,"No, Steve. It was done in nineteen""--she checked herself so swiftly that it was not apparent to anyone but Hook--""in nineteen-six. She saw just the trace of a smile upon his pale, bored face and gave him a quick, warning little look, but he just murmured:  ""Oh...I had forgotten it was as late as that.",1
3860,"As a matter of fact, he knew the exact date, even to the month and day, when it had been finished. And, still musing on the vagaries of the sex, he thought: ""Why will they be so stupid! She must understand that to anyone who knows the least thing about Mallows' life the date is as familiar as the fourth of July!""  ""Of course,"" Mrs. Jack was saying rapidly, ""I was just a child when it was made.",1
3861,"I couldn't have been more than eighteen at the time--if I was that. Which would make you not more than forty-one now,"" thought Hook cynically--""if you are that! Well, my dear, you were twenty when he painted you--and you had been married for more than two years... Why do they do it! he thought impatiently, and with a feeling of sharp annoyance. He looked at her and caught a quick expression--startled, almost pleading--in her eyes. He followed her glance, and saw the awkward figure of George Webber standing ill at ease in the doorway leading from the dining-room. Ah! It's this boy! he thought. She's told him then that--"" and, suddenly, remembering her pleading look, he was touched with pity. Aloud, however, he merely murmured indifferently:  ""Oh, yes, you couldn't have been very old.",1
3862,"And God!"" exclaimed Mrs. Jack, ""but I was beautiful!""  She spoke the words with such innocent delight that they lost any trace of objectionable vanity they might have had, and people smiled at her affectionately. Amy Carleton, with a hasty little laugh, said impulsively:  ""Oh, Esther! Honestly, you're the most ...1 But I mean!""--she cried impatiently, with a toss of her dark head, as if answering some invisible antagonist--""she is!""  ""In all your days,"" said Mrs. Jack, her face suffused with laughter, ""you never saw the like of me!",1
3863,"I was just like peaches and cream. I'd have knocked your eye out! But, darling! You do now!"" cried Amy. What I mean to say is--darling, you're the most...! Isn't she, Steve? She laughed uncertainly, turning to Hook with feverish eagerness.",1
3864,"And he, seeing the ruin, the loss, the desperation in her splintered eves, was sick with horror and with pity. He looked at her disdainfully, with weary, lidded eyes, said: ""What?"" quite freezingly, and then turned away, saying with an accent of boredom: ""Oh. Beside him was the smiling face of Mrs. Jack, and, above, the portrait of the lovely girl that she had been. And the anguish and the mystery of time stabbed through him.",1
3865,"My God, here she is! he thought. Still featured like a child, still beautiful, still loving someone--a boy!--almost as lovely now as she was then when Mallows was a boy!""  1901!",1
3866,"Ah, Time! The figures reeled in a drunken dance and he rubbed his hand before his eyes. In 1901! How many centuries ago was that? How many lives and deaths and floods, how many million days and nights of love, of hate, of anguish and of fear, of guilt, of hope, of disillusion and defeat here in the geologic aeons of this monstrous catacomb, this riddled isle!--In 1901! Good God! It was the very Prehistoric Age of Man! Why, all that had happened several million years ago! Since then so much had begun and ended and been forgotten--so many untold lives of truth, of youth, of old age, so much blood and sweat and agony had gone below the bridge--why, he himself had lived through at least a hundred lives of it. Yes, he had lived and died through so many births and deaths and dark oblivions of it, had striven, fought, and hoped, and been destroyed through so many centuries of it, that even memory had failed--the sense of time had been wiped out--and all of it now seemed to have happened in a timeless dream. 1901! Looked at from here and now, it was a kind of Grand Canyon of the human nerves and bones and blood and brain and flesh and words and thought, all timeless now, all congealed, all solidified in an unchanging stratum there impossibly below, mixed into a general geologic layer with all the bonnets, bustles, and old songs, the straw hats and the derbies, the clatter of forgotten hooves, the thunder of forgotten wheels upon forgotten cobbles--all merged together now with the skeletons of lost ideas in a single stratum of the sunken world--while she----  --She!",1
3867,"Why, surely she had been a part of it with him! She had turned to speak to another group, and he could hear her saying: Oh yes, I knew Jack Reed. He used to come to Mabel Dodge's place. We were great friends... That was when Alfred Stieglitz had started his salon----""  Ah, all these names!",1
3868,"Had he not been with these as well? Or, was it but another shape, a seeming, in this phantasmal shadow-show of time? Had he not been beside her at the launching of the ship? Had they not been captives together among Thracian faces? Had he not lighted tapers to the tent when she had come to charm remission from the lord of Macedon?--All these were ghosts--save she! And she--devouring child of time--had of this whole huge company of ghosts alone remained immortal and herself, had shed off the chrysalis of all these her former selves as if each life that she had lived was nothing but an outworn garment, and now stood here--here! Good God!--upon the burnt-out candle-end of time--with her jolly face of noon, as if she had just heard of this brave new world on Saturday--and would see if all of it was really true to-morrow!",1
3869,"Mrs. Jack had turned back once more at the sound of Amy's voice and had bent forward to listen to the girl's disjointed exclamations as if, by giving more concentrated attention, she could make sense of what the girl was trying to say. I mean!...You know!...But Esther! Darling, you're the most...! It's the most...! I mean, when I look at both of you, I simply can't""--cried Amy with hoarse elation, her lovely face all sunning over with light--""Oh, what I mean to say is""--she cried, then shook her head strongly, tossed another cigarette away impatiently, and cried with the expiration of a long sigh--""Gosh!""  Poor child!",1
3870,"Poor child! Hook turned pompously away to hide the naked anguish in his eyes. So soon to grow, to go, to be consumed and die like all of us! She was, he felt, like him, too prone to live her life upon the single instant, never saving out anything as a prudent remnant for the hour of peril or the day of ruin--too prone to use it all, to give it all, burning herself out like last night's moths upon a cluster of hard light!",1
3871,"Poor child! Poor child! So quick and short and temporal, both you and I, thought Hook--the children of a younger kind! While these! He looked about him at the sensual volutes of strong nostrils curved with scornful mirth. These others of this ancient chemistry--unmothed, re-born, and venturesome, yet wisely mindful of the flame--these others shall endure! Ah, Time!  Poor child!",1
3872,"16. A Moment of Decision George Webber had helped himself generously to the sumptuous feast so temptingly laid out in the dining-room, and now, his hunger sated, he had been standing for a few minutes in the doorway surveying the brilliant scene in the great living-room. He was trying to make up his mind whether to plunge boldly in and find somebody to talk to, or whether to put off the ordeal a little longer by lingering over the food. He thought with regret that there were still a few dishes that he had not even tasted. He had already eaten so much, however, that he knew he could not make a convincing show of taking more, so there seemed to be nothing for it but to screw up his courage and make the best of the situation.",1
3873,"He had just reached this conclusion, with a feeling of ""Now you're in for it!""--when he caught a glimpse of Stephen Hook, whom he knew and liked, and with a great sense of relief he started towards him. Hook was leaning on the mantel, talking with a handsome woman. He saw George coming and extended his soft, plump hand sideways, saying casually:",1
3874,"Oh. How are you?...Look. His tone, as always when he did something that was prompted by the generous and sensitive warmth of his spirit, was deliberately indifferent and masked with an air of heavy boredom. Have you a telephone? I was trying to get you the other day. Can't you come and have lunch with me some time? As a matter of fact, this idea had never occurred to him until that moment.",1
3875,"Webber knew that he had thought of it in an instant reflex of sympathy to put him at his ease, to make him feel less desperately shipwrecked in these glittering, sophisticated tides, to give him something ""to hold on to"". Ever since he had first met Hook and had seen his desperate shyness and the naked terror in his eyes, he had understood the kind of man he was. He had never been deceived by the show of aloof weariness or the elaborately mannered speech. Beneath these disguises he had felt the integrity, the generosity, the nobility, the aspiration in the man's tortured soul. So, now, with profound gratitude, he reached out and shook his hand, feeling as he did so like a bewildered swimmer seizing on the one thing that could sustain him in these disturbing and unfathomed currents which were edged somehow with menace. He stammered out a hasty greeting, said he would be delighted to go to lunch with him some time--any time--any time at all; and he took a place beside Hook as though he meant to stay there for the rest of the evening.",1
3876,"Hook talked to him a little while in his casual way and introduced the woman. George tried to engage her in conversation, but, instead of answering his remarks, she just looked at him coolly and said nothing. Embarrassed by this behaviour, George looked round him as if searching for someone, and in a final effort to say something, to give some show of ease and purpose which he did not feel, he blurted out:  ""Have--have you seen Esther anywhere about?""  As he said the words he knew how stiff and clumsy they sounded, and how absurd, too, for Mrs. Jack, as anyone could see, was standing talking to some of the guests not ten feet away.",1
3877,"And the woman, as if she had been waiting for just such an opening, now answered him at once. Turning to him with a bright, superior smile, she said with cool unfriendliness:  ""About? Yes, I think you'll find her about--just about there,"" nodding in the direction of Mrs. Jack.",1
3878,"It was not a very witty remark. To George it seemed almost as stupid as his own words had been. He knew, too, that the unfriendliness behind it was impersonal--just the mark of fashion, a willingness to sacrifice manners to the chance of making a smart retort. Why, then, did his face now flush with anger? Why did he double up his fist and turn upon the trivial and smiling creature with such smouldering menace that it seemed he was about to commit a physical assault upon her?",1
3879,"In the very instant that he assumed this belligerent attitude he realised that he was acting like a baffled clodhopper, and this consciousness made him feel ten times the yokel that he looked. He tried to think of telling words with which to answer her, but his mind was paralysed and he was conscious only of the burning sensation in his face and neck. He knew that his ill-fitting coat was sticking out round his collar, that he was cutting a sorry figure, and that the woman--""That damned bitch! he muttered to himself--was laughing at him. So, defeated and discomfited utterly, not so much by the woman as by his own ineptitude, he turned and stalked away, hating himself, the party, and, most of all, his folly in coming.",1
3880,"Well, he hadn't wanted to come! That was Esther's doing! She was responsible for this! It was all her fault! Full of confusion and irrational anger at everything and everybody, he backed himself against the wall on the opposite side of the room and stood there clenching and unclenching his fists and glaring round him.",1
3881,"But the violence and the injustice of his feelings soon began to have a calming and sobering effect upon him. Then he saw the absurdity of the whole episode, and began to laugh and mock inwardly at himself. So this is why you didn't want to come! he thought scornfully. You were afraid some silly fool of an ill-bred woman would make an inane remark that would prick your delicate hide! God, what a fool you are! Esther was right!",1
3882,"But had she been right, really? He had made such an issue of it with his talk about the work he had to do as a novelist, and how he had to keep clear of her world in order to do it. Was all that just a way of rationalising his sense of social inadequacy? Had he gone to such lengths of theorising merely to spare his tender ego the ridicule and humiliation of such a scene as he had just precipitated?",1
3883,"No, that was not the answer. There was more to it than that. By now he had cooled off enough to be able to look at himself objectively, and all at once he realised that he had never got clear in his own mind what he had meant when he had talked to Esther about her world and his world. He had used the phrases as symbols of something real, something important that he had felt instinctively but had never put into words. And that's why he hadn't been able to make her understand. Well, what was it? What had he been afraid of? It wasn't only that he didn't like big parties and knew himself to be unschooled in the social graces that such occasions demanded. That was a part of it--yes. But it was only a part--the smallest part, the petty, personal part. There was something else--something impersonal, something much bigger than himself, something that mattered greatly to him and that would not be denied. What was it now? Better face it and try to get it straight.",1
3884,"Completely cool now, and fascinated by the inner problem which the ridiculous little incident had brought into sharp focus, he began to look about him at the people in the room. He watched their faces closely and tried to penetrate behind the social masks they wore, probably, boring, searching as for some clue that might lead him to an answer to his riddle. It was, he knew, a distinguished gathering. It included brilliant, successful men and beautiful women. They were among the best and highest that the city had to offer. But as he looked them over with an alert eye and with all his sensitivities keenly awakened by his present purpose, he saw that there were some among them who wore quite another hue.",1
3885,"That fellow there, for instance! With his pasty face and rolling eyes and mincing ways, and hips that wiggled suggestively as he walked--could there be any doubt at all that he was a member of nature's other sex? Webber knew that people of this fellow's type and gender were privileged personalities, the species being regarded tenderly as a cross between a lap-dog and a clown. Almost every fashionable hostess considered them essential functionaries at smart gatherings like this. Why was it, George wondered. Was it something in the spirit of the times that had let the homosexual usurp the place and privilege of a hunch-backed jester of an old king's court, his deformity become a thing of open jest and ribaldry? However it had come about, the thing itself was indubitable. The mincing airs and graces of such a fellow, his antics and his gibes, the spicy sting of his feminine and envenomed wit, were the exact counterparts of the malicious quips of ancient clowns. So, now. As this simpering fellow minced along, the powdered whiteness of his parchment face held languidly to one side, the weary eyes half-closed and heavy-lidded, he would pause from time to time to wave with a maidenly gesture of his wrist at various people of his acquaintance in different parts of the big room, saying as he did so:  ""Oh, hello!...There you are!...You must come over!",1
3886,"The effect of all this was so irresistible that the ladies shrieked with laughter, and the gentlemen spluttered and guffawed. And that woman over there in the corner, the one with the mannish haircut and angular lines and hard, enamelled face, holding the hand of that rather pretty and embarrassed young girl--a nymphomaniac if ever he saw one. At the sound of the splintered phrases: ""I mean!...You know!""--Webber turned and saw the dark curls of Amy Carleton. He knew who she was, and he knew her story, but even if he had not known he thought he would have guessed a part of it by the tragic look of lost innocence in her face. But what he noticed chiefly now was the group of men who followed her about, among them the young Jew and the young Japanese--and the sight made him think of a pack of dogs trailing after a bitch in heat. It was so open, so naked, so shameless that it almost made him sick.",1
3887,"His eye took in John Ettinger, standing a little apart with his wife and his mistress, and he read their relationship unmistakably in their bearing towards each other. At these repeated signs of decadence in a society which had once been the object of his envy and his highest ambition, Webber's face had begun to take on a look of scorn. Then he saw Mr. Jack moving suavely among his guests, and suddenly, with a rush of blood to his face, he thought about himself. Who was he to feel so superior? Did they not all know who be was, and why he was here?",1
3888,"Yes, all these people looked at one another with untelling eyes. Their speech was casual, quick, and witty. But they did not say the things they knew. And they knew everything. They had seen everything. They had accepted everything. And they received every new intelligence now with a cynical and amused look in their untelling eyes. Nothing shocked them any more. It was the way things were. It was what they had come to expect of life.",1
3889,"Ah, there he had it! That was part of the answer. It was not so much what they did, for in this there was no appreciable difference between themselves and him. It was their attitude of acceptance, the things they thought and felt about what they did, their complaisance about themselves and about their life, their loss of faith in anything better. He himself had not yet come to that, he did not want to come to it. This was one of the reasons, he now knew, why he did not want to be sealed to this world that Esther belonged to.",1
3890,"Still, there could be no question that these people were an honoured group. They had stolen no man's ox or ass. Their gifts were valuable and many, and had won for them the world's grateful applause.",1
3891,"Was not the great captain of finance and industry, Lawrence Hirsch, a patron of the arts as well, and a leader of advanced opinion? Yes. His views on child labour, share-cropping, the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti, and other questions that had stirred the indignation of the intellectual world were justly celebrated for their enlightenment and their liberalism. Who should cavil, then, at the fact that a banker might derive a portion of his income from the work of children in the textile factories of the South?--that another part of it might be derived from the labour of share-croppers in the tobacco fields?--that still another might come from steel mills in the Middle West where armed thugs had been employed to shoot into the ranks of striking workers? A banker's business was to invest his money wherever he could get the best return. Business was business, and to say that a man's social views ought to come between him and his profits was cavilling, indeed! As for Mr. Hirsch himself, he had his devoted champions even among the comrades of the left, who were quick to point out that theoretical criticism of this sort was childish. The sources of Mr. Hirsch's wealth and power, whatever they might be, were quite accidental and beside the point. His position as a liberal, ""a friend of Russia"", a leader of advanced social opinion, a searching critic, indeed, of the very capitalist class to which he belonged, was so well known as to place him in the very brain and forehead of enlightened thought.",1
3892,"As for these others in the illustrious company that Webber now saw on every side, not one of them had ever said: ""Let them eat cake! When the poor had starved, these had suffered. When the children toiled, these had bled. When the oppressed, the weak, the stricken and betrayed men had been falsely accused and put to death, these tongues had been lifted in indignant protest--if only the issue had been fashionable! These had written letters to the press, carried placards upon Beacon Hill, joined parades, made contributions, lent the prestige of their names to form committees of defence.",1
3893,"All this was indubitably true. But as he thought about it now, Webber also felt that such as these might lift their voices and parade their placards till the crack of doom, but that in the secret and entrenched resources of their lives they had all battened on the blood of common man, and wrung their profits from the sweat of slaves, like any common overseer of money and of privilege that ever lived. The whole tissue of these princely lives, he felt, these lesbic and pederastic loves, these adulterous intrigues, sustained in mid-air now, floating on the face of night like a starred veil, had none the less been spun from man's common dust of sweated clay, unwound out of the entrails of man's agony.",1
3894,"Yes, that was it! That was the answer! That was the very core of it! Could he as a novelist, as an artist, belong to this high world of privilege without taking upon himself the stultifying burden of that privilege? Could he write truthfully of life as he saw it, could he say the things he must, and at the same time belong to this world of which he would have to write? Were the two things possible? Was not this world of fashion and of privilege the deadliest enemy of art and truth? Could he belong to the one without forsaking the other? Would not the very privilege that he might gain from these, the great ones of the city, come between him and the truth, shading it, tempering it, and in the end betraying it? And would he then be any different from a score of others who had let themselves be taken into camp, made captive by false visions of wealth and ease, and by the deadly hankering for respectability--that gilded counterfeit which so often passes current for the honest coin of man's respect?",1
3895,"That was the danger, and it was real enough. It was, he knew, no mere phantom of his distempered and suspicious mind. Had it not happened over and over again? Think of all the young writers, among them some of the best, who had won acclaim for the promise of their genius, and then had left their promise unfulfilled because they had traded their birthright for just such a mess of the world's pottage. They, too, had begun as seekers after truth, but had suffered some eclipse of vision and had ended as champions of some special and limited brand of truth. They were the ones who became the special pleaders for things as they are, and their names grew fat and sleek in the pages of the Saturday Evening Post and the women's magazines. Or they became escapists and sold themselves to Hollywood, and were lost and sunk without a trace. Or, somewhat differently, but following the same blind principle, they identified themselves with this or that group, clique, faction, or interest in art or politics, and led forlorn and esoteric little cults and isms. These were the innumerable small fry who became literary Communists, or single-taxers, or embattled vegetarians, or believers in salvation through nudism. Whatever they became--and there was no limit to their variety--they were like the blind men with the elephant: each one of them had accepted some part of life for the whole, some fragmentary truth or half-truth for truth itself, some little personal interest for the large and all-embracing interest of mankind. If that happened to him, how, then, could he sing America?",1
3896,"The problem was clearing up now. In the exhilaration of this moment of sharp vision the answers to his questions were beginning to come through. He was beginning to see what he must do. And as he saw the end of the road down which, willingly, hopefully, even joyfully, he had been travelling with Esther, he saw, too--swiftly, finally, irrevocably--that he must break with her and turn his back upon this fabulous and enchanting world of hers--or lose his soul as an artist. That is what it came down to.",1
3897,"But even in the very instant that he saw it, and knew that it was so, and accepted it, he was overwhelmed with such a sudden sense of loss that he all but cried out in his pain and love. Was there, then, no simple truth and certainty to be found anywhere? Must one for ever be stretched out on the rack? Forever in his youth he had envisioned the starred face of the night with high exaltation and noble inspiration, longing to dream great dreams and think great thoughts in the company of the world's most honoured great. And now, in this very moment of the dream come true, with the ones he had always envied from afar surrounding him here 'on every side--now to have the selfless grandeur turn to dust, and to see great night itself a reptile coiled and waiting at the heart of life! To find no ear or utterance anywhere for all the blazing, baffled certitudes of youth! To find man's faith betrayed and his betrayers throned in honour, themselves the idols of his bartered faith! To find truth false and falsehood truth, good evil, evil good, and the whole web of life so changing, so mercurial!",1
3898,"It was all so different from the way he had once thought it would be--and suddenly, convulsively, forgetful of his surroundings, he threw out his arms in an instinctive gesture of agony and loss. 17. Mr. Hirsch Could Wait Esther had seen George's gesture and wondered what it meant. She disengaged herself from the people to whom she had been talking and came over to him, a frown of tender solicitude on her face.",1
3899,"Darling,"" she said eagerly, taking his hand and looking at him earnestly, ""how are you getting along? Are you all right?""  In his confusion and anguish he could not answer her for a moment, and when he did, the guilty knowledge of the decision he had just arrived at made him lash out angrily as though in self-defence. Who said I wasn't all right? he demanded harshly. Why shouldn't I be? And, instantly, seeing her gentle face, he was filled with baffled and furious regret.",1
3900,"Oh, all right, all right,"" she said hastily and placatingly. I just wanted to know if--are you having a good time?"" she said, with a little forced smile. Don't you think it's a nice party--hah? You want to meet anyone? You must know some of the people here. Before he had a chance to say anything more Lily Mandell came weaving through the crowded room to Mrs. Jack's side.",1
3901,"0 Esther, darling,"" she said in a drowsy tone, ""I wonder if you've heard--"" Seeing the young man, she paused. Oh, hello. I didn't know you were here. There was a note of protest in her voice.",1
3902,"These two had met before, but only casually. They shook hands. And all at once Mrs. Jack's face was glowing with happiness. She put her own hands in a firm clasp upon those of the man and woman, and whispered:  ""My two.",1
3903,"Two of the people that I love best in the whole world. You must know and love each other as I do you. In the grip of her deep emotion she fell silent, while the other two remained clumsily holding hands.",1
3904,"After a moment, awkwardly, they let their hands drop to their sides and stood ill at ease, looking at each other. Just then Mr. Lawrence Hirsch sauntered up. He was calm and assured, and did not seem to be following anyone. His hands in he trouser pockets of his evening clothes, a man fashionably at ease, urbanely social, a casual ambler from group to group in this brilliant gathering, informed, alert, suave, polished, cool, detached--he was the very model of what a great captain of finance, letters, arts, and enlightened principles should be.",1
3905,"0 Esther,"" he said, ""I must tell you what we have found out about the case. The tone was matter-of-fact and undisturbed, carrying the authority of calm conviction. Two innocent men were put to death. At last we have positive proof of it--evidence that was never allowed to come to light. It proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that Vanzetti could not have been within fifty miles of the crime. Mr. Hirsch spoke quietly, and did not look at Miss Mandell.",1
3906,"But how horrible! cried Mrs. Jack, righteous anger blazing up in her as she turned to Mr. Hirsch. Isn't it dreadful to know that such things can happen in a country like this! It's the most damnable thing I ever heard of!",1
3907,"For the first time, now, Mr. Hirsch turned to Miss Mandell, casually, as if he had only just become aware of her presence. Yes, isn't it? he said, including her with charming yet not over-zealous intimacy within the range of his quiet enthusiasm. Don't you think--? Miss Mandell did not actually step on him.",1
3908,"She just surveyed him slowly, with a smouldering look of loathing. What!"" she said. Then to Mrs. Jack: ""Really! I simply can't-- She shrugged helplessly, despairingly, and moved away, a miracle of sensual undulance.",1
3909,"And Mr. Hirsch--he did not follow her, not even with a glance. Nor did he show by so much as the flicker of a lash that he had seen or heard or noticed anything. He went on talking in his well-modulated tones to Mrs. Jack.",1
3910,"In the middle of what he was saying, suddenly he noticed George Webber. Oh, hello,"" he said. How are you? He detached one hand from his elegant pocket and for a moment bestowed it on the young man, then turned back again to Mrs. Jack, who was still burning with hot indignation over what she had heard.",1
3911,"These miserable people who could be guilty of such a thing! she exclaimed. These despicable, horrible, rich people! It's enough to make you want a revolution! she cried.",1
3912,"Well, my dear,"" said Mr. Hirsch with cool irony, ""you may have your wish gratified. It's not beyond the realm of possibility. And if it comes, that case may still return to plague them yet. The trials, of course, were perfectly outrageous, and the judge should have been instantly dismissed. To think that there are people living who could do a thing like that!",1
3913,"cried Mrs. Jack. You know,"" she went on earnestly and somewhat irrelevantly, ""I have always been a Socialist. I voted for Norman Thomas. You see,"" she spoke very simply and with honest self-respect, ""I've always been a worker. All my sympathy is on their side. Mr. Hirsch's manner had become a trifle vague, detached, as if he were no longer paying strict attention.",1
3914,"It is a cause célèbre,"" he said, and, seeming to like the sound of the words, he repeated them portentously: ""A cause célèbre. Then, distinguished, polished, and contained, with casual hands loose-pocketed beneath his tails, he sauntered on. He moved off in the general direction of Miss Mandell. And yet he did not seem to follow her.",1
3915,"For Mr. Lawrence Hirsch was wounded sorrowfully. But he could wait. Oh, Beddoes! Beddoes!""  At these strange words, so exultantly spoken that they rang round the walls of the great room, people halted in the animation of their talk with one another and, somewhat startled, looked in the direction from which the sounds had proceeded.",1
3916,"Oh, Beddoes by all means! the voice cried even more exuberantly than before. Hah-hah-hah! Beddoes!""--there was gloating in the laugh. Everyone must, of course, they simply must!",1
3917,"The speaker was Mr. Samuel Fetzer. He was not only an old friend of Mrs. Jack's, but apparently he was also a familiar of many of the people there, because when they saw who it was they smiled at one another and murmured: ""Oh, it's Sam,"" as if that explained everything. In the world to which he belonged Mr. Samuel Fetzer was known as ""the book-lover"" par excellence. His very appearance suggested it. One needed only to look at him to know that he was an epicure, a taster of fine letters, a collector and connoisseur of rare editions. One could see with half an eye that he was the kind of fellow you might expect to find on a rainy afternoon in a musty old bookshop, peering and poking and prowling round the stacks with a soft, cherubic glow on his ruddy features, and occasionally fingering with a loving hand some tattered old volume. He made one think somehow of a charming thatched cottage in the English countryside--of a pipe, a shaggy dog, a comfortable chair, a warm nook by the blazing fire, and an old book and a crusty bottle--a bottle of old port! In fact, the exultant way in which he now pronounced the syllables of ""Beddoes!"" suggested a bottle of old port. He fairly smacked his lips over the word, as if he had just poured himself a glass of the oldest and rarest vintage and taken his first appraising sip.",1
3918,"His whole appearance confirmed this impression of him. His pleasant, sensitive, glowing face, which wore a constant air of cherubic elation, and his high bald forehead were healthily browned and weathered as if he spent much time tramping in the open air. And, in contrast to the other guests, who were all in formal evening dress, he had on tan, thick-soled English walking shoes, woollen socks, grey flannel trousers, a trifle baggy but fashionably Oxonian, a tweed coat of brownish texture, a soft white shirt, and a red tie. One would have said, at sight of him, that he must have just come in from a long walk across the moors, and that now, pleasantly tired, he was looking forward with easeful contemplation to an evening spent with his dog, beside his fire, with a bottle of old port, and Beddoes. One would never have guessed the truth--that he was an eminent theatrical director whose life since childhood had been spent in the city, along Broadway and among the most highly polished groups of urban society.",1
3919,"He was talking now to Miss Mandell. She had wandered over to him after leaving Mrs. Jack, and had asked him the provocative question which had touched off his extraordinary demonstration of enthusiasm. Miss Mandell was herself somewhat of an adept in the arts--a delver into some of the rarer obscurities. She was forever asking people what they thought of William Beckford's Vathek, the plays of Cyril Tourneur, the sermons of Lancelot Andrewes, or--as now--the works of Beddoes.",1
3920,"What she had said, to be exact, was: ""Did you ever read anything by a man named Beddoes?""  Miss Mandell had the habit of putting her questions that way, and she would even use the same form of oblique reference when she spoke of the more famous objects of her aesthetic interest. Thus she would inquire what one knew about ""a man named Proust"", or ""a woman named Virginia Woolf"". The phrase, accompanied as it always was by a dark and smouldering look, carried an air of ""There's more to this than meets the eye"". It made Miss Mandell appear to be a person of profound and subtle knowingness, and one whose deep and devious searchings had gone so far beyond the platitudes that might be found in the Encyclopadia Britannica and other standard works that there was really no way left for her to learn anything new except, possibly, through a quiet talk with Mr. T. S. Eliot--or, since he wasn't handy, through an occasional tentative yet not very optimistic question addressed to someone of superior intelligence like oneself. And after one had answered Miss Mandell and had poured forth whatever erudition one commanded on the subject of her interest, her usual comment would be a simple and non-committal ""Um"". This always produced a very telling effect. For as Miss Mandell murmured ""Um"" and wandered off, the victim was left flattened out, feeling that he had emptied himself dry and still had been found childishly superficial and pathetically wanting.",1
3921,"Not so, however, Mr. Samuel Fetzer. If Miss Mandell had hoped to work this technique on him when she wove her languorous way to his side and casually asked: ""Did you ever read anything by a man named Beddoes?""--she was in for a rude surprise. She had caught a tartar--a cherubic tartar, it is true, a benevolent tartar, an exultant, exuberant, elated tartar--but a. tartar nevertheless. For Mr. Fetzer had not only read Beddoes: he felt that he had rather discovered Beddoes. Beddoes was one of Mr. Fetzer's philobiblic pets. So he was not only ready for Miss Mandell: it almost seemed as if he had been waiting for her. She had hardly got the words out of her mouth before he fairly pounced upon her, and his pleasant face lit up all over with a look of cherubic glee as he cried:",1
3922,"Oh, Beddoes! The name rang out with such explosive enthusiasm that Miss Mandell recoiled as if someone had thrown a lighted firecracker at her feet, ""Beddoes! he chortled. Beddoes!""--he smacked his lips. Hah-hah-hah! Beddoes!""--he cast back his head, shook it, and chuckled gloatingly. Then he told her about Beddoes' birth, about his life, about his death, about his family, and his friends, about his sisters and his cousins and his aunts, about things that were well known about Beddoes, and about other things that no one in the world except Mr. Samuel Fetzer had ever known about Beddoes. Oh, Beddoes!"" cried Mr. Fetzer for the sixteenth time. I love Beddoes! Everybody must read Beddoes! Beddoes is----""  ""But he was insane, wasn't he?",1
3923,"The quiet, well-bred voice was that of Mr. Lawrence Hirsch, who had just wandered up casually, as if attracted by the noise of cultural enthusiasm, and without seeming to follow anyone. I mean,"" he turned with an air of gracious explanation to Miss Mandell, ""it's an interesting example of the schizophrenic personality, don't you think? She looked at him for a long moment as one might look at a large worm within the core of a chestnut that one had hoped was sound.",1
3924,"Um,"" said Miss Mandell, and with an expression of drowsy loathing on her face she moved away. Mr. Hirsch did not follow her. Perfectly possessed, he had already shifted his glance back to the glowing Mr. Fetzer.",1
3925,"I mean,"" he continued, with that inflection of interested inquiry which is the mark everywhere of a cultivated intelligence, ""it always seemed to me that it was a case of misplaced personality--an Elizabethan out of his time. Or do you think so?""  ""Oh, absolutely!"" cried Mr. Fetzer, with instant and enthusiastic confirmation. You see, what I have always maintained----""  Mr. Hirsch appeared to be listening carefully.",1
3926,"He really was not following anyone. He kept his eyes focused on Mr. Samuel Fetzer's face, but something in their expression indicated that his mind was elsewhere. For Mr. Lawrence Hirsch was wounded sorrowfully. But he could wait.",1
3927,"So it went all evening. Mr. Hirsch moved from group to sophisticated group, bowing, smiling suavely, exchanging well-bred pleasantries with all he met. Always he was imperturbable, authoritatively assured, on his aesthetic toes. And his progress through that brilliant assemblage was marked by a phosphorescent wake composed of the small nuggets of enlightenment which he dropped casually as he passed. Here it was a little confidential gossip about Sacco and Vanzetti, there a little first-hand information from Wall Street, now a sophisticated jest or so, again an amusing anecdote about what happened only last week to the President, or a little something about Russia, with a shrewd observation on Marxian economy--and to all of this a little Beddoes had been added for good measure. It was all so perfectly informed and so alertly modern that it never for a moment slipped into cliche, but always represented the very latest mode in everything, whether art, letters, politics, or economics. It was a remarkable performance, an inspiring example of what the busy man of affairs can really accomplish if he only applies himself.",1
3928,"And, in addition to all this, there was Miss Mandell. He never seemed to follow her, but wherever she went he was not far behind. One always knew that he was there. All evening long, whenever he came up to any group and honoured it with one of his apt observations, and then, turning casually and discovering that Miss Mandell was among the company, made as if to include her in the intimate circle of his auditors, she would just give him a smouldering look and walk away. So it was no wonder that Mr. Lawrence Hirsch was wounded sorrowfully.",1
3929,"Still, he did not beat his breast, or tear his hair, or cry out: ""Woe is me! He remained himself, the man of many interests, the master of immense authorities. For he could wait.",1
3930,"He did not take her aside and say: ""Thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair, thou hast doves' eyes. Nor did he say: ""Tell me, 0 thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest. He did not remark to her that she was beautiful as Tirzah, or comely as Jerusalem, or terrible as an army with banners. He did not ask anyone to stay him with flagons, or comfort him with apples, or confess that he was sick of love. And as for saying to her: ""Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor; thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies,"" the idea had never occurred to him.",1
3931,"Though he did not cry out to her in his agony, what he was thinking was: ""Flaunt me with your mockery and scorn, spurn me with your foot, lash me with your tongue, trample me like a worm, spit upon me like the dust of which I am composed, revile me to your friends, make me crawl far and humbly--do anything you like, I can endure it. But, oh, for God's sake, notice me! Speak to me with just a word--if only with hate! Stay near me for just a moment, make me happy with just a touch--even if the nearness is but loathing, and the touch a blow! Treat me in any way you will But I beg you, 0 beloved that thou art""--out of the corner of his eye he followed her lavish undulations as she turned and walked away again--""in God's name, let me see you know that I am here!",1
3932,"But he said nothing. He showed nothing of what he felt. He was sorrowfully wounded, but he could wait. And no one but Miss Mandell knew how long she intended to keep him waiting.",1
3933,"18. Piggy Logan's Circus The hour had now arrived for Mr. Piggy Logan and his celebrated I circus of wire dolls. Till now he had kept himself secreted in the guest-room, and as he made his entrance there was a flurry of excited interest in the brilliant throng. People in the dining-room crowded to the door, holding tinkling glasses or loaded plates in their hands, and even old Jake Abramson let his curiosity draw him away from the temptations of the table long enough to appear in the doorway gnawing at a chicken leg.",1
3934,"Mr. Piggy Logan was attired for his performance in a costume that was simple yet extraordinary. He had on a thick blue turtleneck sweater of the kind that was in favour with college heroes thirty years ago. Across the front of it--God knows why--was sewn an enormous home-made Y. He wore old white canvas trousers, tennis sneakers, and a pair of battered knee pads such as were formerly used by professional wrestlers. His head was crowned with an ancient football helmet, the straps securely fastened underneath his heavy jowls. Thus arrayed, he came forward, staggering between his two enormous valises.",1
3935,"The crowd made way for him and regarded him with awe. Mr. Logan grunted under his burden, which he dropped with a thump in the middle of the living-room floor, and breathed an audible sigh of relief. Immediately he began pushing back the big sofa and all the chairs and tables and other furniture until the centre of the room was clear. He rolled back the rug, and then started taking books from the shelves and dumping them on the floor. He looted half a dozen shelves in different parts of the room and in the vacant spaces fastened up big circus posters, yellow with age, which showed the familiar assortment of tigers, lions, elephants, clowns, and trapeze performers, and bore such descriptive legends as ""Barnum & Bailey--May 7th and 8th,"" ""Ringling Brothers--July 31st. The gathering watched him curiously as he went about this labour of methodical destruction.",1
3936,"When he had finished he came back to his valises and began to take out their contents. There were miniature circus rings made of rounded strips of tin or copper which fitted neatly together. There were trapezes and flying swings. And there was an astonishing variety of figures made of wire to represent all the animals and performers. There were clowns and trapeze artists, acrobats and tumblers, horses and bareback lady riders. There was almost everything that one could think of to make a circus complete, and all of it was constructed of wire.",1
3937,"Mr. Logan was down on his knee-pads extremely busy with his work, his mind as completely focused on it as though he had been alone in the room. He rigged up his trapezes and swings and took meticulous care in arranging each of the little wire figures of elephants, lions, tigers, horses, camels, and performers. He was evidently of a patient turn of mind, and it took him half an hour, or more to set everything up. By the time he had finished his labours and had erected a little sign which said: ""Main Entrance"", all the guests, who at first had watched him curiously, had grown tired of waiting and had resumed their interrupted talking, eating, and drinking.",1
3938,"At length Mr. Logan was ready, and signified his willingness to begin by a gesture to his hostess. She clapped her hands as loudly as she could and asked for silence and attention. But just then the door-bell rang, and a lot of new people were ushered in by Nora. Mrs. Jack looked somewhat bewildered, for the new arrivals were utter strangers. For the most part they were young people. The young women had that unmistakable look of having gone to Miss Spence's School, and there was something about the young men which indicated that they were recently out of Yale and Harvard and Princeton, and were members of the Racquet Club, and were now connected with investment brokers in Wall Street.",1
3939,"With them was a large and somewhat-decayed looking lady of advanced middle age. She had evidently been a beauty in her palmy days, but now everything about her--arms, shoulders, neck, face, and throat--was blown, full, and loose, and made up a picture of corrupted elegance. It was a picture of what Amy Carleton might look like thirty years from now, if she were careful and survived. One felt unpleasantly that she had lived too long in Europe, probably on the Riviera, and that somewhere in the offing there was something with dark, liquid eyes, a little moustache, and pomaded hair--something quite young and private and obscene and kept.",1
3940,"This lady was accompanied by an elderly gentleman faultlessly attired in evening dress, as were all the others. He had a cropped moustache and artificial teeth, which were revealed whenever he paused to lick his thin lips lecherously and to stutter out: ""What? What?""--as he began to do almost at once. Both of these people looked exactly like characters who might have been created by Henry James if he had lived and written in a later period of decay.",1
3941,"The whole crowd of newcomers streamed in noisily, headed by a spruce young gentleman in white tie and tails whose name was shortly to be made known as Hen Walters. He was evidently a friend of Mr. Logan. Indeed, they all seemed to be friends of Mr. Logan. For as Mrs. Jack, looking rather overwhelmed at this invasion, advanced to greet them and was dutifully murmuring her welcome, all of them swarmed right past her, ignoring her completely, and stormed into the room shouting vociferous gaieties at Mr. Logan. Without rising from his knee-pads, he grinned at them fondly and with a spacious gesture of his freckled hand beckoned them to a position along one wall. They crowded in and took the place he had indicated. This forced some of the invited guests back into the far corners, but the new arrivals seemed not to mind this at all. Indeed, they paid not the slightest attention to anybody.",1
3942,"Then somebody in the group saw Amy Carleton and called across to her. She came over and joined them, and seemed to know several of them. And one could see that all of them had heard of her. The debutantes were polite but crisply detached. After the formalities of greeting they drew away and eyed Amy curiously and furtively, and their looks said plainly: ""So this is she!",1
3943,"The young men were less reserved. They spoke to her naturally, and Hen Walters greeted her quite cordially in a voice that seemed to be burbling with suppressed fun. It was not a pleasant voice: it was too moist, and it seemed to circulate round a nodule of fat phlegm. With the gleeful elation which marked his whole manner he said loudly:  ""Hello, Amy!",1
3944,"I haven't seen you for an age. What brings you here? The tone indicated, with the unconscious arrogance of his kind, that the scene and company were amusingly bizarre and beyond the pale of things accepted and confirmed, and that to find anyone he knew in such a place was altogether astounding.",1
3945,"The tone and its implications stung her sharply. As for herself, she had so long been the butt of vicious gossip that she could take it with good nature or complete indifference. But an affront to someone she loved was more than she could endure. And she loved Mrs. Jack. So, now, her green-gold eyes flashed dangerously as she answered hotly:  ""What brings me here--of all places!",1
3946,"Well, it's a very good place to be--the best I know... And I mean!""--she laughed hoarsely, jerked the cigarette from her mouth, and tossed her black curls with furious impatience--""I mean! After all, I was invited, you know!",1
3947,"Instinctively, with a gesture of protective warmth, she had slipped her arm round Mrs. Jack, who, wearing a puzzled frown upon her face, was standing there as if still a little doubtful of what was happening. Esther, darling,"" Amy said, ""this is Mr. Hen Walters--and some of his friends. For a moment she looked at the cluster of young débutantes and their escorts, and then turned away, saying to no one in particular, and with no effort to lower her voice: ""God, aren't they simply dreadful!...I mean!...You know!""--she addressed herself now to the elderly man with the artificial teeth--""Charley--in the name of God, what are you trying to do?...You old cradle-snatcher, you!... I mean!--after all, it's not that bad, is it? She surveyed the group of girls again and turned away with a brief, hoarse laugh. All these little Junior League bitches! she muttered. God!... How do you stand it, anyway--you old bastard! She was talking now in her natural tone of voice, good-naturedly, as though there was nothing in the least unusual in what she Was saying. Then with another short laugh she added: ""Why don't you come to see me any more?""  He licked his lips nervously and bared his artificial teeth before he answered:  ""Wanted to see you, Amy, for ever so long...What?...Intended to stop in...Matter of fact, did stop by some time ago, but you'd just sailed...What?...You've been away, haven't you?...What?",1
3948,"As he spoke in his clipped staccato he kept licking his thin lips lecherously, and at the same time he scratched himself, rooting obscenely into the inner thigh of his right leg in a way that suggested he was wearing woollen underwear. In doing so he inadvertently pulled up his trouser leg and it stayed there, revealing the tops of his socks and a portion of white meat. Meanwhile Hen Walters was smiling brightly and burbling on to Mrs. Jack:  ""So nice of you to let us all come in""--although",1
3949,"she, poor lady, had had nothing at all to do with it. Piggy told us it would be all right. I hope you don't mind. But no-o--not at all!"" she protested, still with a puzzled look.",1
3950,"Any friends of Mr. Logan's...But won't you all have a drink, or something to eat? There's loads----""  ""Oh, heavens, no!"" burbled Mr. Walters. We've all been to Tony's and we simply gorged ourselves! If we took another mouthful, I'm absolutely positive we should explode!",1
3951,"He uttered these words with such ecstatic jubilation that it seemed he might explode at any moment in a large, moist bubble. Well, then, if you're sure,"" she began. Oh, absolutely!"" cried Mr. Walters rapturously. But we're holding up the show! he exclaimed. And, after all, that's what we're here to see. It would simply be a tragedy to miss it...0 Piggy! he shouted to his friend, who had been cheerfully grinning all the while and crawling about on his knee-pads. Do begin! Everyone's simply dying to see it!...I've seen it a dozen times myself,"" he announced gleefully to the general public, ""and it becomes more fascinating every time... So if you're ready, please begin! Mr. Logan was ready.",1
3952,"The new arrivals held their position along one wall, and the other people now withdrew a little, leaving them to themselves. The audience was thus divided into two distinct halves--the people of wealth and talent on one side, and those of wealth and fashion or ""Society"" on the other. On a signal from Mr. Logan, Mr. Walters detached himself from his group, came over, arranged the tails of his coat, and knelt down gracefully beside his friend. Then, acting on instructions, he read aloud from a typewritten paper which Mr. Logan had handed to him. It was a whimsical document designed to put everybody in the right mood, for it stated that in order to enjoy and understand the circus one must make an effort to recover his lost youth and have the spirit of a child again. Mr. Walters read it with great gusto in a cultivated tone of voice which almost ran over with happy laughter. When he had finished, he got up and resumed his place among his friends, and Mr. Logan then began his performance.",1
3953,"It started, as all circuses should, with a grand procession of the performers and the animals in the menagerie. Mr. Logan accomplished this by taking each wire figure in his thick hand and walking it round the ring and then solemnly out again. Since there was a great many animals and a great many performers, this took some time, but it was greeted at its conclusion with loud applause.",1
3954,"Then came an exhibition of bareback riders. Mr. Logan galloped his wire horses into the ring and round and round with movements of his hand. Then he put the riders on top of the wire horses, and, holding them firmly in place, he galloped these round too. Then there was an interlude of clowns, and he made the wire figures tumble about by manipulating them with his hands. After this came a procession of wire elephants. This performance gained particular applause because of the clever way in which Mr. Logan made the figures imitate the swaying, ponderous lurch of elephants--and also because people were not always sure what each act meant, and when they were able to identify something, a pleasant little laugh of recognition would sweep the crowd and they would clap their hands to show they had got it.",1
3955,"There were a good many acts of one kind or another, and at last the trapeze performers were brought on. It took a little while to get this act going because Mr. Logan, with his punctilious fidelity to reality, had first to string up a little net below the trapezes. And when the act did begin it was unconscionably long, chiefly because Mr. Logan was not able to make it work. He set the little wire figures to swinging and dangling from their perches. This part went all right. Then he tried to make one little figure leave its trapeze, swing through the air, and catch another figure by its downswept hands. This wouldn't work. Again and again the little wire figure soared through the air, caught at the outstretched hands of the other doll--and missed ingloriously. It became painful. People craned their necks and looked embarrassed. But Mr. Logan was not embarrassed. He giggled happily with each new failure and tried again. It went on and on. Twenty minutes must have passed while Mr. Logan repeated his attempts. But nothing happened. At length, when it became obvious that nothing was going to happen, Mr. Logan settled the whole matter himself by taking one little figure firmly between two fat fingers, conveying it to the other, and carefully hooking it on to the other's arms. Then he looked up at his audience and giggled cheerfully, to be greeted after a puzzled pause by perfunctory applause.",1
3956,"Mr. Logan was now ready for the grand climax, the pièce de rèsistance of the entire occasion. This was his celebrated sword-swallowing act. With one hand he picked up a small rag doll, stuffed with wadding and with crudely painted features, and with the other hand he took a long hairpin, bent it more or less straight, forced one end through the fabric of the doll's mouth, and then began patiently and methodically to work it down the rag throat. People looked on with blank faces, and then, as the meaning of Mr. Logan's operation dawned on them, they smiled at one another in a puzzled, doubting way.",1
3957,"It went on and on until it began to be rather horrible. Mr. Logan kept working the hairpin down with thick, probing fingers, and when some impediment of wadding got in his way he would look up and giggle foolishly. Halfway down he struck an obstacle that threatened to stop him from going any farther. But he persisted--persisted horribly.",1
3958,"It was a curious spectacle and would have furnished interesting material for the speculations of a thoughtful historian of life and customs in this golden age. It was astounding to see so many intelligent men and women--people who had had every high and rare advantage of travel, reading, music, and aesthetic cultivation, and who were usually so impatient of the dull, the boring, and the trivial--patiently assembled here to give their respectful attention to Mr. Piggy Logan's exhibition. But even respect for the accepted mode was wearing thin. The performance had already lasted a weary time, and some of the guests were beginning to give up. In pairs and groups they would look at one another with lifted eyebrows, and quietly would filter out into the hall or in the restorative direction of the dining-room.",1
3959,"Many, however, seemed determined to stick it out. As for the young ""Society"" crowd, all of them continued to look on with eager interest. Indeed, as Mr. Logan went on probing with his hairpin, one young woman with the pure, cleanly chiselled face so frequently seen in members of her class turned to the young man beside her and said:  ""I think it's frightfully interesting--the way he does that.",1
3960,"Don't you?""  And the young man, evidently in the approved accent, said briefly: ""Eh!""--an ejaculation which might have been indicative of almost anything, but which was here obviously taken for agreement. This interchange between them had taken place, like all the conversations in the group, in a curiously muffled, clipped speech. Both the girl and the young man had barely opened their mouths--their words had come out between almost motionless lips. This seemed to be the fashionable way of talking among these people.",1
3961,"As Mr. Logan kept working and pressing with his hairpin, suddenly the side of the bulging doll was torn open and some of the stuffing began to ooze out. Miss Lily Mandell watched with an expression of undisguised horror and, as the doll began to lose its entrails, she pressed one hand against her stomach in a gesture of nausea, said ""Ugh!""--and made a hasty exit. Others followed her. And even Mrs. Jack, who at the start of the performance had slipped on a wonderful jacket of gold thread and seated herself cross-legged on the floor like a dutiful child, squarely before the maestro and his puppets, finally got up and went out into the hall, where most of her guests were now assembled.",1
3962,"Almost no one was left to witness the concluding scenes of Mr. Piggy Logan's circus except the uninvited group of his own particular friends. Out in the hall Mrs. Jack found Lily Mandell talking to George Webber. She approached them with a bright, affectionate little smile and queried hopefully:  ""Are you enjoying it, Lily?",1
3963,"And you, darling?""--turning fondly to George--""Do you like it? Are you having a good time? Lily answered in a tone of throaty disgust:  ""When he kept on pushing that long pin into the doll and all its insides began oozing out--ugh!""--she made a nauseous face--""I simply couldn't stand it any longer!",1
3964,"It was horrible! I had to get out! I thought I was going to puke!""  Mrs. Jack's shoulders shook, her face reddened, and she gasped in a hysterical whisper:  ""I know!",1
3965,"Wasn't it awful! But what is it, anyway?"" said the attorney, Roderick Hale, as he came up and joined them. Oh, hello, Rod!"" said Mrs. Jack. What do you make of it Hale? I can't make it out,"" he said, with an annoyed look into the living-room, where Piggy Logan was still patiently carrying on.",1
3966,"What is it all supposed to be, anyway? And who is this fellow? he said in an irritated tone, as if his legal and fact-finding mind was annoyed by a phenomenon he could not fathom. It's like some puny form of decadence,"" he murmured.",1
3967,"Just then Mr. Jack approached his wife and, lifting his shoulders in a bewildered shrug, said:  ""What is it? My God, perhaps I'm crazy!""  Mrs. Jack and Lily Mandell bent together, shuddering helplessly as women do when they communicate whispered laughter to one another. Poor Fritz! Mrs. Jack gasped faintly.",1
3968,"Mr. Jack cast a final bewildered look into the living-room, surveyed the wreckage there, then turned away with a short laugh: I'm going to my room! he said with decision. Let me know if he leaves the furniture!""  19.",1
3969,"Unscheduled Climax At the conclusion of Mr. Logan's performance there was a ripple of applause in the living-room, followed by the sound of voices. The fashionable young people clustered round Mr. Logan, chattering congratulations. Then, without paying attention to anybody else, and without a word to their hostess, they left.",1
3970,"Other people now gathered about Mrs. Jack and made their farewells. They began to leave, singly and in pairs and groups, until presently no one remained except those intimates and friends who are always the last to leave a big party--Mrs. Jack and her family, George Webber, Miss Mandell, Stephen Hook, and Amy Carleton. And, of course, Mr. Logan, who was busy amid the general wreckage he had created, putting his wire dolls back into his two enormous valises.",1
3971,"The atmosphere of the whole place was now curiously changed. It was an atmosphere of absence, of completion. Everybody felt a little bit as one feels in a house the day after Christmas, or an hour after a wedding, or on a great liner at one of the Channel ports when most of the passengers have disembarked and the sorrowful remnant know that the voyage is really over and that they are just marking time for a little while until their own hour comes to depart.",1
3972,"Mrs. Jack looked at Piggy Logan and at the chaos he had made of her fine room, and then glanced questioningly at Lily Mandell as if to say: ""Can you understand all this? What has happened? Miss Mandell and George Webber surveyed Mr. Logan with undisguised distaste. Stephen Hook remained aloof, looking bored. Mr. Jack, who had come forth from his room to bid his guests good-bye and had lingered by the elevator till the last one had gone, now peered in through the hall door at the kneeling figure in the living-room, and with a comical gesture of uplifted hands said: ""What is it?""--leaving everybody convulsed with laughter.",1
3973,"'But even when Mr. Jack came into the room and stood staring down quizzically, Mr. Logan did not look up. He seemed not to have heard anything. Utterly oblivious of their presence, he was happily absorbed in the methodical task of packing up the litter that surrounded him.",1
3974,"Meanwhile the two rosy-cheeked maids, May and Janie, were busily clearing away glasses, bottles, and bowls of ice, and Nora started putting the books back on their shelves. Mrs. Jack looked on rather helplessly, and Amy Carleton stretched herself out flat on the floor with her hands beneath her head, closed her eyes, and appeared to go to sleep. All the rest were obviously at a loss what to do, and just stood and sat around, waiting for Mr. Logan to finish and be gone.",1
3975,"The place had sunk back into its wonted quiet. The blended murmur of the unceasing city, which during the party had been shut out and forgotten, now penetrated the walls of the great building and closed in once more upon these lives. The noises of the street were heard again.",1
3976,"Outside, below them, there was the sudden roar of a fire truck, the rapid clanging of its bell. It turned the corner into Park Avenue and the powerful sound of its motors faded away like distant thunder. Mrs. Jack went to the window and looked out. Other trucks now converged upon the corner from different directions until four more had passed from sight.",1
3977,"I wonder where the fire can be,"" she remarked with detached curiosity. Another truck roared down the side street and thundered into Park. It must be quite a big one--six engines have driven past. It must be somewhere in this neighbourhood. Amy Carleton sat up and blinked her eyes, and for a moment all of them were absorbed in idle speculation about where the fire might be.",1
3978,But presently they began to look again at Mr. Logan. At long last his labours seemed to be almost over. He began to close the big valises and adjust the straps.,1
3979,"Just then Lily Mandell turned her head towards the hall, sniffed sharply, and suddenly said:  ""Does anyone smell smoke? Hah? What?"" said Mrs. Jack. And then, going into the hall, she cried excitedly: ""But yes! There is quite a strong smell of smoke out here! I think it would be just as well if we got out of the building until we find out what's wrong. Her face was now burning with excitement. I suppose we'd better,"" she said. Everybody come on! Then: ""0 Mr. Logan!""--she raised her voice, and now for the first time he lifted his round and heavy face with an expression of inquiring innocence--""I say--I think perhaps we'd all better get out, Mr. Logan, until we find out where the fire is! Are you ready?""  ""Yes, of course,"" said Mr. Logan cheerfully.",1
3980,"But fire?""--in a puzzled tone. What fire? Is there a fire? I think the building is on fire,"" said Mr. Jack smoothly, but with an edge of heavy irony, ""so perhaps we'd better all get out--that is, unless you prefer to stay.",1
3981,"Oh no,"" said Mr. Logan brightly, getting clumsily to his feet. I'm quite ready, thank you, except for changing my clothes--""  ""I think that had better wait,"" said Mr. Jack. Oh, the girls!"" cried Mrs. Jack suddenly, and, snapping the ring on and off her finger, she trotted briskly towards the dining-room, ""Nora--Janie--May! Girls! We're all going downstairs--there's a fire somewhere in the building. You'll have to come with us till we find out where it is. Fire, Mrs. Jack?"" said Nora stupidly, staring at her mistress.",1
3982,"Mrs. Jack saw at a glance her dull eye and her flushed face, and thought: ""She's been at it again! I might have known it! Then aloud, impatiently:  ""Yes, Nora, fire.",1
3983,"Get the girls together and tell them they'll have to come along with us. And--oh!--Cook! she cried quickly. Where is Cookie? Go get her, someone. Tell her she'll have to come, too!",1
3984,"The news obviously upset the girls. They looked helplessly at one another and began to move aimlessly round, as if no longer certain what to do. Shall we take our things, Mrs. Jack?"" said Nora, looking at her dully. Will we have time to pack? Of course not, Nora!"" exclaimed Mrs. Jack, out of all patience.",1
3985,"We're not moving out! We're simply going downstairs till we can learn where the fire is and how bad it is!... And Nora, please get Cook and bring her with you! You know how rattled and confused she gets! Yes'm,"" said Nora, staring at her helplessly.",1
3986,"An' will that be all mum?---I mean""--and gulped--""will we be needin' anything?""  ""For heaven's sake, Nora--no!...Nothing except your coats. Tell the girls and Cook to wear their coats. Yes'm,"" said Nora dumbly, and after a moment, looking fuddled and confused, she went uncertainly through the dining-room to the kitchen.",1
3987,"Mr. Jack meanwhile, had gone out into the hall and was ringing the elevator bell. There, after a short interval, his family, guests, and servants joined him. Quietly he took stock of them:  Esther's face was flaming with suppressed excitement, but her sister, Edith, who had hardly opened her mouth all evening and had been so inconspicuous that no one had noticed her, was her usual pale, calm self.",1
3988,"Good girl, Edith! His daughter, Alma, he observed with satisfaction, was also taking this little adventure in her stride. She looked cool, beautiful, a bit bored by it all. The guests, of course, were taking it as a lark--and why not?--they had nothing to lose. All except that young Gentile fool--George What's-his-name. Look at him now--all screwed up and tense, pacing back and forth and darting his feverish glances in all directions. You'd think it was his property that was going up in smoke!",1
3989,"But where was that Mr. Piggy Logan? When last seen, he was disappearing into the guest-room. Was the idiot changing his clothes after all?--Ah, here he comes! At least,"" thought Mr. Jack humorously, ""it must be he, for if it isn't who in the name of God is it? The figure that Mr. Logan now cut as he emerged from the guest-room and started down the hall was, indeed, a most extraordinary one.",1
3990,"All of them turned to look at him and saw that he was taking no chances of losing his little wire dolls or his street clothes in any fire. Still wearing the ""costume"" that he had put on for his performance, he came grunting along with a heavy suitcase in each hand, and over one shoulder he had slung his coat, vest, and trousers, his overweight tan shoes were tied together by their laces and hung suspended round his neck, where they clunked against his chest as he walked, and on his head, perched on top of the football helmet, was his neat grey hat. So accoutred, he came puffing along, dropped his bags near the elevator, then straightened up and grinned cheerfully.",1
3991,"Mr. Jack kept on ringing the bell persistently, and presently the voice of Herbert, the elevator boy, could be heard shouting up the shaft from a floor or two below:  ""All right! All right! I'll be right up, folks, as soon as I take down this load!",1
3992,"The sound of other people's voices, excited, chattering, came up the shaft to them; then the elevator door banged shut and they could hear the car going down. There was nothing to do but wait. The smell of smoke in the hallway was getting stronger all the time, and although no one was seriously alarmed, even the phlegmatic Mr. Logan was beginning to feel the nervous tension.",1
3993,"Soon the elevator could be heard coming up again. It mounted steadily--and then suddenly stopped somewhere just below them. Herbert could be heard working his lever and fooling with the door. Mr. Jack rang the bell impatiently. There was no response. He hammered on the door. Then Herbert shouted up again, and he was so near that all of them could hear every word:  ""Mr. Jack, will you all please use the service elevator.",1
3994,"This one's, out of order. I can't go any farther. Well, that's that,"" said Mr. Jack.",1
3995,"He put on his derby, and without another word started down the hall towards the service landing. In silence the others followed him. ,  At this moment the lights went out.",1
3996,"The place was plunged in inky blackness. There was a brief, terrifying moment when the women caught their breaths sharply. In the darkness the smell of smoke seemed much stronger, more acrid and biting, and it was beginning to make their eyes smart. Nora moaned a little, and all; the servants started to mill round like stricken cattle. But they calmed down at the comforting assurance in Mr. Jack's quiet voice speaking in the dark:  ""Esther,"" he said calmly, ""we'll have to light candles.",1
3997,"Can you tell' me where they are? She told him. He reached into a table drawer, pulled out a flashlight, and went through a door that led to the kitchen. Soon he reappeared with a box of tallow candles. He gave one to each person and lighted them.",1
3998,"They were now a somewhat ghostly company. The women lifted their candles and looked at one another with an air of bewildered surmise. The faces of the maids and Cookie, in the steady flame that each held before her face, looked dazed and frightened. Cookie wore a confused, fixed smile and muttered jargon to herself. Mrs. Jack, deeply excited, turned questioningly to George, who was at her side:  ""Isn't it strange?"" she whispered.",1
3999,"Isn't it the strangest thing? I mean--the party--all the people--and then this. And, lifting her candle higher, she looked about her at the ghostly company.",1
4000,"And, suddenly, George was filled with almost unbearable love and tenderness for her, because he knew that she, like himself, felt in her heart the mystery and strangeness of all life. And his emotion was all the more poignant because in the same instant, with sharp anguish, he remembered his decision, and knew that they had reached the parting of the ways. Mr. Jack flourished his candle as a signal to the others and led the procession down the hall. Edith, Alma, Miss Mandell, Amy Carleton, and Stephen Hook followed after him. Mr. Logan, who came next, was in a quandary. He couldn't manage both his baggage and his light, so after a moment of indecision he blew out his candle, set it on the floor, seized his valises, gave a mighty heave, and, with neck held stiff to keep his hat from tumbling off of the football helmet, he staggered after the retreating figures of the women. Mrs. Jack and George came last, with the servants trailing behind.",1
4001,"Mrs. Jack had reached the door that opened on to the service landing when she heard a confused shuffling behind her in the line, and when she glanced back along the hallway she saw two teetering candles disappearing in the general direction of the kitchen. It was Cook and Nora. Oh Lord!"" cried Mrs. Jack in a tone of exasperation and despair. What on earth are they trying to do?...Nora! She raised her voice sharply. Cook had already disappeared, but Nora heard her and turned in a bewildered way. Nora, where are you going?"" shouted Mrs. Jack impatiently.",1
4002,"Why--why, mum--I just thought I'd go back here an' get some things,"" said Nora in a confused and thickened voice. No you won't, either!"" cried Mrs. Jack furiously, at the same time thinking bitterly: ""She probably wanted to sneak back there to get another drink!""  ""You come right along with us! she called sharply. And where is Cook? Then, seeing the two bewildered girls, May and Janie, milling round helplessly, she took them by the arm and gave them a little push towards the door. You girls get along! she cried. What are you gawking at?""  George had gone back after the befuddled Nora, and, after seizing her and herding her down the hall, had dashed into the kitchen to find Cook.",1
4003,"Mrs. Jack followed him with her candle held high in her hand, and said anxiously:  ""Are you there, darling? Then, calling out loudly: ""Cook! Cook! Where are you?""  Suddenly Cook appeared like a spectral visitant, still clutching her candle and flitting from room to room down the narrow hall of the servants' quarters.",1
4004,"Mrs. Jack cried out angrily:  ""Oh, Cookie! What are you doing? You've simply got to come on now! We're waiting on you! And she thought to herself again, as she had thought so many times before: ""She's probably an old miser. I suppose she's got her wad hoarded away back there somewhere. That's why she hates to leave. Cook had disappeared again, this time into her own room.",1
4005,"After a brief, fuming silence Mrs. Jack turned to George. They looked at each other for a moment in that strange light and circumstance, and suddenly both laughed explosively. My God!"" shrieked Mrs. Jack. Isn't it the damnedest----""  At this moment Cook emerged once more and glided away down the hall.",1
4006,"They yelled at her and dashed after her, and caught her just as she was about to lock herself into a bathroom. Now Cook!"" cried Mrs. Jack angrily. Come on now! You simply must!""  Cook goggled at her and muttered some incomprehensible jargon in an ingratiating tone.",1
4007,"Do you hear, Cook? Mrs. Jack cried furiously. You've got to come now! You can't stay here any longer!""  ""Augenblick!",1
4008,"Augenblick!"" muttered Cook cajolingly. At last she thrust something into her bosom, and, still looking longingly behind her, allowed herself to be prodded, pushed, and propelled down the servants' hall, into the kitchen, through the door into the main hallway, and thence out to the service landing. All the others were now gathered there, waiting while Mr. Jack tested the bell of the service elevator. His repeated efforts brought no response, so in a few moments he said coolly:",1
4009,"Well, I suppose there's nothing for us to do now except to walk down. Immediately he headed for the concrete stairs beside the elevator shaft, which led, nine flights down, to the ground floor and safety. The others followed him. Mrs. Jack and George herded the servants before them and waited for Mr. Logan to get a firm grip on his suitcases and start down, which at length he did, puffing and blowing and letting the bags bump with loud thuds on each step as he descended.",1
4010,"The electric lights on the service stairways were still burning dimly, but they clung to their candles with an instinctive feeling that these primitive instruments were now more to be trusted than the miracles of science. The smoke had greatly increased. In fact, the air was now so dense with floating filaments and shifting plumes that breathing was uncomfortable.",1
4011,"From top to bottom the service stairs provided an astounding spectacle. Doors were opening now on every floor and other tenants were coming out to swell the tide of refugees. They made an extraordinary conglomeration--a composite of classes, types, and characters that could have been found nowhere else save in a New York apartment house such as this. There were people in splendid evening dress, and beautiful women blazing with jewels and wearing costly wraps. There were others in pyjamas who had evidently been awakened from sleep and had hastily put on slippers, dressing-gowns, kimonos, or whatever garments they could snatch up in the excitement of the moment. There were young and old, masters and servants, a mixture of a dozen races and their excited babel of strange tongues. There were German cooks and French maids, English butlers and Irish serving girls. There were Swedes and Danes and Italians and Norwegians, with a sprinkling of White Russians. There were Poles and Czechs and Austrians, Negroes and Hungarians. All of these poured out helter-skelter on the landing-stages of the service stairway, chattering, gesticulating, their interests all united now in their common pursuit of safety.",1
4012,"As they neared the ground floor, helmeted firemen began to push their way up the stairs against the tide of downward-moving traffic. Several policemen followed them and tried to allay any feelings of alarm or panic. It's all right, folks! Everything's O.K.! one big policeman shouted cheerfully as he went up past the members of the Jack party. The fire's over now! These words, spoken to quiet the people and to expedite their orderly progress from the building, had an opposite effect from that which the policeman had intended.",1
4013,"George Webber, who was bringing up the end of the procession, paused upon hearing these reassuring words, called to the others, and turned to retrace his way upstairs again. As he did so, he saw that the policeman was about to throw a fit. From the landing half a flight above, he was making agonised faces and frantic gestures at George in a silent and desperate entreaty to him not to come back any farther or to encourage the others to come back, but to leave the building as quickly as possible. The others had looked round when George had called, and had witnessed this pantomime--so now, genuinely alarmed for the first time, they turned again and fled down the stairs as fast as they could go.",1
4014,"George himself, seized with the same momentary panic, was hastening after them when he heard some tapping and hammering noises from the shaft of the service elevator. They seemed to come from up above somewhere. For just a moment he hesitated and listened. The tapping began, then stopped...began again...stopped again. It seemed to be a signal of some kind, but he couldn't make it out. It gave him an eerie feeling. A chill ran up his spine. He broke out in goose flesh. Stumbling blindly, he fled after the others.",1
4015,"As they came out into the great central court-yard of the building, their moment's terror dropped away from them as quickly as it had come upon them. They filled their lungs with the crisp, cold air, and so immediate was their sense of release and relief that each one of them felt a new surge of life and energy, a preternaturally heightened aliveness. Mr. Logan, his round face streaming with perspiration and his breath coming in loud snorts and wheezes, summoned his last remaining strength and, ignoring the tender shins of those about him, bumped and banged his burdened way through the crowd and disappeared. The others of Mr. Jack's party remained together, laughing and talking and watching with alert interest everything that was going on round them.",1
4016,"The scene of which they were a part was an amazing one. As if it had been produced by the combining genius of a Shakespeare or a Breughel, the whole theatre of human life was in it, so real and so miraculously compressed that it had the nearness and the intensity of a vision. The great hollow square formed by the towering walls of the building was filled with people in every conceivable variety of dress and undress. And from two dozen entry ways within the arched cloisters that ran round the court on all four sides, new hordes of people were now constantly flooding out of the huge honeycomb to add their own colour and movement and the babel of their own tumultuous tongues to the pageantry and the pandemonium already there. Above this scene, uplifted on the arches of the cloisters, the mighty walls soared fourteen storeys to frame the starry heavens. In the wing where Mr. Jack's apartment was the lights were out and all was dark, but everywhere else those beetling sides were still blazing with their radiant squares of warmth, their many cells still burning with all the huge deposit of their just-departed life.",1
4017,"Except for the smoke that had been in some of the halls and stairways, there was no sign of fire. As yet, few people seemed to comprehend the significance of the event which had so unceremoniously dumped them out of their sleek nests into the open weather. For the most part they were either bewildered and confused or curious and excited. Only an occasional person here and there betrayed any undue alarm over the danger which had touched their lives and fortunes.",1
4018,"Such a one now appeared at a second-floor window on the side of the court directly opposite the Jacks' entry. He was a man with a bald head and a pink, excited face, and it was instantly apparent that he was on the verge of emotional collapse. He threw open the window and in a tone shaken by incipient hysteria cried out loudly:  ""Mary!...Mary!",1
4019,"His voice rose almost to a scream as he sought for her below. A woman in the crowd came forward below the window, looked up, and said quietly:  ""Yes, Albert. I can't find the key!",1
4020,"he cried in a trembling voice. The door's locked! I can't get out!""  ""Oh, Albert,"" said the woman more quietly and with evident embarrassment, ""don't get so excited, dear.",1
4021,You're in no danger--and the key is bound to be there somewhere. I'm sure you'll find it if you look. But I tell you it isn't here!,1
4022,"he babbled. I've looked, and it's not here! I can't find it!...Here, you fellows! he shouted to some firemen who were dragging a heavy hose across the gravelled court. I'm locked in! I want out of here!""  Most of the firemen paid no attention to him at all, but one of them looked up at the man, said briefly: ""O.K., chief!""--and then went on about his work.",1
4023,"Do you hear me? the man screamed. You firemen, you! I tell you...1""  ""Dad...Dad""--a young man beside the woman on the ground now spoke up quietly--""don't get so excited.",1
4024,"You're in no danger there. All the fire is on the other side. They'll let you out in a minute when they can get to you. Across the court, at the very entrance from which the Jacks had issued, a man in evening clothes, accompanied by his chauffeur, had been staggering in and out with great loads of ponderous ledgers.",1
4025,"He had already accumulated quite a pile of them, which he was stacking up on the gravel and leaving under the guardianship of his butler. From the beginning this man had been so absorbed in what he was doing that he was completely unconscious of the milling throng round him. Now, as he again prepared to rush into the smoke-filled corridor with his chauffeur, he was stopped by the police.",1
4026,"I'm sorry, sir,"" the policeman said, ""but you can't go in there again. We've got orders not to let anybody in. But I've got to!",1
4027,"the man shouted. I'm Philip J. Baer! At the sound of this potent name, all those within hearing distance instantly recognised him as a wealthy and influential figure in the motion picture industry, and one whose accounts had recently been called into investigation by a board of governmental inquiry. There are seventy-five millions dollars' worth of records in my apartment,"" he shouted, ""and I've got to get them out! They've got to be saved! He tried to push his way in, but the policeman thrust him back.",1
4028,"I'm sorry, Mr. Baer,"" he said obdurately, ""but we have our orders. You can't come in. The effect of this refusal was instantaneous and shocking.",1
4029,"The one principle of Mr. Baer's life was that money is the only thing that counts because money can buy anything. That principle had been flouted. So the naked philosophy of tooth and claw, which in moments of security and comfort was veiled beneath a velvet sheath, now became ragingly insistent. A tall, dark man with a rapacious, beak-nosed face, he became now like a wild animal, a beast of prey. He went charging about among the crowds of people, offering everyone fabulous sums if they would save his cherished records. He rushed up to a group of firemen, seizing one of them by the arm and shaking him, shouting:  ""I'm Philip J. Baer--I live in there!",1
4030,You've got to help me! I'll give any man here ten thousand dollars if he'll get my records out! The burly fireman turned his weathered face upon the rich man.,1
4031,"On your way, brother! he said. But I tell you! Mr. Baer shouted. You don't know who I am! I'm----""  ""I don't care who you are!",1
4032,the fireman said. On your way now! We've got work to do!,1
4033,"And, roughly, he pushed the great man aside. Most of the crowd behaved very well under the stress of these unusual circumstances. Since there was no actual fire to watch, the people shifted and moved about, taking curious side looks at one another out of the corners of their eyes. Most of them had never even seen their neighbours before, and now for the first time they had an opportunity to appraise one another. And in a little while, as the excitement and their need for communication broke through the walls of their reserve, they began to show a spirit of fellowship such as that enormous beehive of life had never seen before. People who, at other times, had never deigned so much as to nod at each other were soon laughing and talking together with the familiarity of long acquaintance.",1
4034,"A famous courtesan, wearing a chinchilla coat which her aged but wealthy lover had given her, now took off this magnificent garment and, walking over to an elderly woman with a delicate, patrician face, she threw the coat over this woman's thinly covered shoulders, at the same time saying in a tough but kindly voice:  ""You wear this, dearie. You look cold.",1
4035,"And the older woman, after a startled expression had crossed her proud face, smiled graciously and thanked her tarnished sister in a sweet tone. Then the two women stood talking together like old friends. A haughty old Bourbon of the Knickerbocker type was seen engaged in cordial conversation with a Tammany politician whose corrupt plunderings were notorious, and whose companionship, in any social sense, the Bourbon would have spurned indignantly an hour before.",1
4036,"Aristocrats of ancient lineage who had always held to a tradition of stiff-necked exclusiveness could be seen chatting familiarly with the plebeian parvenus of the new rich who had got their names and money, both together, only yesterday. And so it went everywhere one looked. One saw race-proud Gentiles with rich Jews, stately ladies with musical-comedy actresses, a woman famous for the charities with a celebrated whore.",1
4037,"Meanwhile the crowd continued to watch curiously the labours of the firemen. Though no flames were visible, there was plenty of smoke in some of the halls and corridors, and the firemen had dragged in many lengths of great white hose which now made a network across the court in all directions. From time to time squadrons of helmeted men would dash into the smoky entries of the wing where the lights were out and would go upstairs, their progress through the upper floors made evident to the crowd below by the movement of their flashlights at the darkened windows. Others would emerge from the lower regions of basements and subterranean passages, and would confer intimately with their chiefs and leaders.",1
4038,"All at once somebody in the waiting throng noticed something and pointed towards it. A murmur ran through the crowd, and all eyes were turned upwards searchingly to one of the top-floor apartments in the darkened wing. There, through an open window four floors directly above the Jack's apartment, wisps of smoke could be seen curling upwards.",1
4039,"Before very long the wisps increased to clouds, and suddenly a great billowing puff of oily black smoke burst through the open window, accompanied by a dancing shower of sparks. At this the whole crowd drew in its collective breath in a sharp intake of excitement--the strange, wild joy that people always feel when they see fire. Rapidly the volume of smoke increased. That single room on the top floor was apparently the only one affected, but now the black and oily-looking smoke was billowing out in belching folds, and inside the room the smoke was coloured luridly by the sinister and unmistakable glow of fire.",1
4040,"Mrs. Jack gazed upwards with a rapt and fascinated expression. She turned to Hook with one hand raised and lightly clenched against her breast, and whispered slowly:  ""Steve--isn't it the strangest--the most----? She did not finish. With her eyes full of the deep sense of wonder that she was trying to convey, she just stood with her hand loosely clenched and looked at him.",1
4041,"He understood her perfectly--too well, indeed. His heart was sick with fear, with hunger, and with fascinated wonder. For him the whole scene was too strong, too full of terror and overwhelming beauty to be endured. He was sick with it, fainting with it. He wanted to be borne away, to be sealed hermetically somewhere, in some dead and easeful air where he would be free forever more of this consuming fear that racked his flesh. And yet he could not tear himself away. He looked at everything with sick but fascinated eyes. He was like a man mad with thirst who drinks the waters of the sea and sickens with each drop he drinks, yet cannot leave off drinking because of the wetness and the coolness to his lips. So he looked and loved it all with the desperate ardour of his fear. He saw the wonder of it, the strangeness of it, the beauty and the magic and the nearness of it. And it was so much more real than anything imagination could contrive that the effect was overpowering. The whole thing took on an aura of the incredible.",1
4042,"It can't be true,"" he thought. It's unbelievable. But here it is!",1
4043,"And there it was. He didn't miss a thing. And yet he stood there ridiculously, a derby hat upon his head, his hands thrust into the pockets of his overcoat, the velvet collar turned up round his neck, his face, as usual, turned three-quarters away from the whole world, his heavy-lidded, wearily indifferent eyes surveying the scene with Mandarin contempt, as if to say: ""Really, what is this curious assembly? Who are these extraordinary creatures that go milling about me? And why is everyone so frightfully eager, so terribly earnest about everything? A group of firemen thrust past him with the dripping brass-nozzled end of a great hose.",1
4044,"It slid through the gravel like the tough-scaled hide of a giant boa constrictor, and as the firemen passed him, Hook heard their booted feet upon the stones and he saw the crude strength and the simple driving purpose in their coarse faces. And his heart shrank back within him, sick with fear, with wonder, with hunger, and with love at the unconscious power, joy, energy, and violence of life itself. At the same moment a voice in the crowd--drunken, boisterous, and too near--cut the air about him. It jarred his ears\, angered him, and made him timorously hope it would not come closer. Turning slightly towards Mrs. Jack, in answer to her whispered question, he murmured in a bored tone:  ""Strange?...Um...yes.",1
4045,"An interesting revelation of the native moeurs. Amy Carleton seemed really happy. It was as if, for the first time that evening, she had found what she was looking for. Nothing in her manner or appearance had changed. The quick, impetuous speech, the broken, semi-coherent phrases, the hoarse laugh, the exuberant expletives, and the lovely, dark, crisp-curled head with its snub nose and freckled face were just the same. Still there was something different about her. It was as if all the splintered elements of her personality had now, in the strong and marvellous chemistry of the fire, been brought together into crystalline union. She was just as she had been before, except that her inner torment had somehow been let out, and wholeness let in.",1
4046,"Poor child! It was now instantly apparent to those who knew her that, like so many other ""lost"" people, she would not have been lost at all--if only there could always be a fire. The girl could not accept getting up in the morning or going to bed at night, or doing any of the accustomed things in their accustomed order. But she could and did accept the fire. It seemed to her wonderful. She was delighted with everything that happened. She threw herself into it, not as a spectator, but as a vital and inspired participant. She seemed to know people everywhere, and could be seen moving about from group to group, her ebony head bobbing through the crowd, her voice eager, hoarse, abrupt, elated. When she returned to her own group she was full of it all.",1
4047,"I mean!...You know! she burst out. These firemen here!""--she gestured hurriedly towards three or four helmeted men as they dashed into a smoke-filled entry with a tube of chemicals--""when you think of what they have to know!--of what they have to do!--I went to a big fire once!""--she shot out quickly in explanatory fashion--""a guy in the department was a friend of mine!--I mean!""--she laughed hoarsely, elatedly--""when you think of what they have to----""  At this point there was a splintering crash within.",1
4048,"Amy laughed jubilantly and made a quick and sudden little gesture as if this answered everything. After all, I mean! she cried.",1
4049,"While this was going on, a young girl in evening dress had wandered casually up to the group and, with that freedom which the fire had induced among all these people, now addressed herself in the flat, nasal, and almost toneless accents of the Middle West to Stephen Hook:  ""You don't think it's very bad, do you? she said, looking up at the smoke and flames that were now belching formidably from the top-floor window. Before anyone had a chance to answer, she went on: ""I hope it's not bad. Hook, who was simply terrified at her raw intrusion, had turned away from her and was looking at her sideways with eyes that were almost closed.",1
4050,"The girl, getting no answer from him, spoke now to Mrs. Jack:  ""It'll be just too bad if anything is wrong up there, won't it? Mrs. Jack, her face full of friendly reassurance, answered quickly in a gentle voice. No, dear,"" she said, ""I don't think it's bad at all. She looked up with trouble in her eyes at the billowing mass of smoke and flame which now, to tell the truth, looked not only bad but distinctly threatening; then, lowering her perturbed gaze quickly, she said to the girl encouragingly: ""I'm sure everything is going to be all right. Well,"" said the girl, ""I hope you're right...",1
4051,"Because,"" she added, apparently as an afterthought as she turned away, ""that's Mama's room, and if she's up there it'll be just too bad, won't it?--I mean, if it is too bad. With this astounding utterance, spoken casually in a flat voice that betrayed no emotion whatever, she moved off into the crowd. There was dead silence for a moment. Then Mrs. Jack turned to Hook in alarm, as if she were not certain she had heard aright.",1
4052,"Did you hear?--"" she began in a bewildered tone. But there you are! broke in Amy, with a short, exultant laugh. What I mean is--the whole thing's there!""  20.",1
4053,"Out of Control Suddenly all the lights in the building went out, plunging the court in darkness save for the fearful illumination provided by the bursts of flame from the top-floor apartment. There was a deep murmur and a restless stir in the crowd. Several young smart alecks in evening clothes took this opportunity to go about among the dark mass of people, arrogantly throwing the beams of their flashlights into the faces of those they passed.",1
4054,"The police now began to move upon the crowd, and, good-naturedly but firmly, with outstretched arms, started to herd everybody back, out of the court, through the arches, and across the surrounding streets. The streets were laced and criss-crossed everywhere with bewildering skeins of hose, and all normal sounds were lost in the powerful throbbing of the fire-engines. Unceremoniously, like driven cattle, the residents of the great building were forced back to the opposite pavements, where they had to take their places among the humbler following of the general public.",1
4055,"Some of the ladies, finding themselves too thinly clad in the cold night air, sought refuge in the apartments of friends who lived in the neighbourhood. Others, tired of standing round, went to hotels to wait or to spend the night. But most of the people hung on, curious and eager to what the outcome might be. Mr. Jack took Edith, Alma, Amy, and two or three young people of Amy's acquaintance to a near-by hotel for drinks. The others stayed and looked on curiously for a while. But presently Mrs. Jack, George Webber, Miss Mandell, and Stephen Hook repaired to a drug-store that was close at hand. They sat at the counter, ordered coffee and sandwiches, and engaged in eager chatter with other refugees who now filled the store.",1
4056,"The conversation of all these people was friendly and casual. Some were even gay. But in their talk there was also now a note of perturbation--of something troubled, puzzled, and uncertain. Men of wealth and power had been suddenly dispossessed from their snug nests with their wives, families, and dependents, and now there was nothing they could do but wait, herded homelessly into drug-stores and hotel lobbies, or huddled together in their wraps on street corners like shipwrecked voyagers, looking at one another with helpless eyes. Some of them felt, dimly, that they had been caught up by some mysterious and relentless force, and that they were being borne onwards as unwitting of the power that ruled them as blind flies fastened to a revolving wheel. To others came the image of a tremendous web in which they felt they had become enmeshed--a web whose ramifications were so vast and complicated that they had not the faintest notion where it began or what its pattern was.",1
4057,"For in the well-ordered world in which these people lived, something had gone suddenly wrong. Things had got out of control. They were the lords and masters of the earth, vested with authority and accustomed to command, but now the control had been taken from them. So they felt strangely helpless, no longer able to command the situation, no longer able even to find out what was happening.",1
4058,"But, in ways remote from their blind and troubled kenning, events had been moving to their inexorable conclusion. In one of the smoky corridors of that enormous hive, two men in boots and helmets had met in earnest communion. Did you find it? Yes.""  ""Where is it?""  ""It's in the basement, chief.",1
4059,It's not on the roof at all--a draught is taking it up a vent. But it's down there. He pointed with his thumb.,1
4060,"Well, then, go get it. You know what to do. It looks bad, chief.",1
4061,"It's going to be hard to get. What's the trouble? If we flood the basement, we'll also flood two levels of railroad tracks.",1
4062,You know what that means. For a moment their eyes held each other steadily. Then the older man jerked his head and started for the stairs.,1
4063,"Come on,"" he said. We're going down. Down in the bowels of the earth there was a room where lights were burning and it was always night.",1
4064,"There, now, a telephone rang, and a man with a green eyeshade seated at a desk answered it. Hello...Oh, hello, Mike. He listened carefully for a moment, suddenly jerked forward taut with interest, and pulled the cigarette out of his mouth.",1
4065,"The hell you say!...Where? Over track thirty-two?...They're going to flood it!...Hell! Deep in the honeycombs of the rock the lights burned green and red and yellow, silent in the eternal dark, lovely, poignant as remembered grief. Suddenly, all up and down the faintly gleaming rails, the green and yellow eyes winked out and flashed to warning red.",1
4066,"A few blocks away, just where the network of that amazing underworld of railroad yards begins its mighty flare of burnished steel, the Limited halted swiftly, but so smoothly that the passengers, already standing to debark, felt only a slight jar and were unaware that anything unusual had happened. Ahead, however, in the cab of the electric locomotive which had pulled the great train the last miles of its span along the Hudson River, the engineer peered out and read the signs. He saw the shifting patterns of hard light against the dark, and swore:  ""Now what the hell?",1
4067,"And as the great train slid to a stop, the current in the third rail was shut off and the low whine that always came from the powerful motors of the locomotive was suddenly silenced. Turning now across his instruments to another man, the engineer spoke quietly:  ""I wonder what the hell has happened,"" he said. For a long time the Limited stood a silent and powerless thing of steel, while a short distance away the water flooded down and flowed between the tracks there like a river. And five hundred men and women who had been caught up from their lives and swiftly borne from cities, towns, and little hamlets all across the continent were imprisoned in the rock, weary, impatient, frustrated--only five minutes away from the great station that was the end and goal of their combined desire. And in the station itself other hundreds waited for them--and went on waiting--restless, wondering, anxious, knowing nothing about the why of it.",1
4068,"Meanwhile, on the seventh landing of the service stairs in the evacuated building, firemen had been working feverishly with axes. The place was dense with smoke. The sweating men wore masks, and the only, light they had was that provided by their torchlights.",1
4069,"They had battered open the doorway of the elevator shaft, and one of them had lowered himself down on to the roof of the imprisoned car half a floor below and was now cutting into the roof with his sharp axe. Have you got it, Ed?""  ""Yeah--just about...I'm almost through... This next one does it, I think. The axe smashed down again.",1
4070,"There was a splintering crash. And then:  ""O.K...Wait a minute...Hand me down the flashlight, Tom.""  ""See anything?""  In a moment, quietly:  ""Yeah...I'm going in...Jim, you better come down, too. I'll need you. There was a brief silence, then the man's quiet voice again:  ""O.K...I've got it...",1
4071,"Here, Jim, reach down and get underneath the arms...Got it?...O.K... Tom, you better reach down and help Jim...Good.",1
4072,"Together they lifted it from its imprisoned trap, looked at it for a moment in the flare of their flashlights, and laid it down, not ungently, on the floor--something old and tired and dead and very pitiful. Mrs. Jack went to the window of the drug-store and peered out at the great building across the street. I wonder if anything's happening over there,"" she said to her friends with a puzzled look on her face. Do you suppose it's over? Have they got it out? The dark immensity of those towering walls told nothing, but there were signs that the fire was almost out.",1
4073,"There were fewer lines of hose in the street, and one could see firemen pulling them in and putting them back in the trucks. Other firemen were coming from the building, bringing their tools and stowing them away. All the great engines were still throbbing powerfully, but the lines that had connected them with the hydrants were uncoupled, and the water they were pumping now came from somewhere else and was rushing in torrents down all the gutters. The police still held the crowd back and would not yet permit the tenants to return to their apartments.",1
4074,"The newspapermen, who had early arrived upon the scene, were now beginning to come into the drug-store to telephone their stories to the papers. They were a motley crew, a little shabby and threadbare, with battered hats in which their Press cards had been stuck, and some of them had the red noses which told of long hours spent in speak-easies. One would have known that they were newspapermen even without their Press cards. The signs were unmistakable. There was something jaded in the eye, something a little worn and tarnished about the whole man, something that got into his face, his tone, the way he walked, the way he smoked a cigarette, even into the hang of his trousers, and especially into his battered hat, which revealed instantly that these were gentlemen of the Press.",1
4075,"It was something wearily receptive, wearily cynical, something that said wearily: ""I know, I know. But what's the story? What's the racket? And yet it was something that one liked, too, something corrupted but still good, something that had once blazed with hope and aspiration, something that said: ""Sure.",1
4076,"I used to think I had it in me, too, and I'd have given my life to write something good. Now I'm just a whore. I'd sell my best friend out to get a story. I'd betray your trust, your faith, your friendliness, twist everything you say around until any sincerity, sense, or honesty that might be in your words was made to sound like the maunderings of a buffoon or a clown--if I thought it would make a better story. I don't give a damn for truth, for accuracy, for facts, for telling anything about you people here, your lives, your speech, the way you look, the way you really are, the special quality, tone, and weather of this moment--of this fire--except insofar as they will help to make a story. What I went to get is the special 'angle' on it. There has been grief and love and fear and ecstasy and pain and death to-night: a whole universe of living has been here enacted. But all of it doesn't matter a damn to me if I can only pick up something that will make the customers sit up tomorrow and rub their eyes--if I can tell 'em that in the excitement Miss Lena Ginster's pet boa constrictor escaped from its cage and that the police and fire departments are still looking for it while Members of Fashionable Apartment House Dwell in Terror... So there I am, folks, with yellow fingers, weary eyeballs, a ginny breath, and what is left of last night's hangover, and I wish to God I could get to that telephone to send this story in, so the boss would tell me to go home, and I could step round to Eddy's place for a couple more highballs before I call it another day. But don't be too hard on me. Sure, I'd sell you out, of course. No man's name or any woman's reputation is safe with me--if I can make a story out of it--but at bottom I'm not such a bad guy. I have violated the standards of decency again and again, but in my heart I've always wanted to be decent. I don't tell the truth, but there's a kind of bitter honesty in me for all that. I'm able to look myself in the face at times, and tell the truth about myself and see just what I am. And I hate sham and hypocrisy and pretence and fraud and crookedness, and if I could only be sure that to-morrow was going to be the last day of the world--oh, Christ!--what a paper we'd get out in the morning! And, too, I have a sense of humour, I love gaiety, food, drink, good talk, good companionship, the whole thrilling pageantry of life. So don't be too severe on me. I'm really not as bad as some of the things I have to do. Such, indefinably yet plainly, were the markings of these men.",1
4077,"It was as if the world which had so soiled them with its grimy touch had also left upon them some of its warm earthiness--the redeeming virtues of its rich experience, its wit and understanding, the homely fellowship of its pungent speech. Two or three of them now went round among the people in the drug-store and began to interview them. The questions that they asked seemed ludicrously inappropriate. They approached some of the younger and prettier girls, found out if they lived in the building, and immediately asked, with naive eagerness, whether they were in the Social Register. Whenever any of the girls admitted that she was, the reporters would write down her name and the details of her parentage.",1
4078,"Meanwhile, one of the representatives of the Press, a rather seedy-looking gentleman with a bulbous red nose and infrequent teeth, had called his City Desk on the telephone and, sprawled in the booth with his hat pushed back on his head and his legs sticking out through the open door, was reporting his findings. George Webber was standing with a group of people at the back of the store, near the booth. He had noticed the reporter when he first came in, and had been fascinated by something in his seedy, hard-boiled look; and now, although George appeared to be listening to the casual chatter around him, he was really hanging with concentrated attention on every word the man was saying:  ""...Sure, that's what I'm tellin' yuh.",1
4079,"Just take it down... The police arrived,"" he went on importantly, as if fascinated by his own journalese--""the police arrived and threw a cordon round the building. There was a moment's pause, then the red-nosed man rasped out irritably: ""No, no, no! Not a squadron! A cordon!...What's 'at?... Cordon, I say! C-o-r-d-o-n--cordon!... For Pete's sake! he went on in an aggrieved tone. How long have you been workin' on a newspaper, anyway? Didn't yuh ever hear of a cordon before?... Now get this. Listen----"" he went on in a careful voice, glancing at some scrawled notes on a piece of paper in his hand. Among the residents are included many Social Registerites and others prominent among the younger set... What? How's that? he said abruptly, rather puzzled. Oh!""  He looked round quickly to see if he was being overheard, then lowered his voice and spoke again:",1
4080,"Oh, sure! Two!... Nah, there was only two--that other story was all wrong. They found the old dame... But that's what I'm tellin' yuh! She was all alone when the fire started--see! Her family was out, and when they got back they thought she was trapped up there. But they found her. She was down in the crowd. That old dame was one of the first ones out...Yeh--only two. Both of 'em was elevator men. He lowered his voice a little more, then, looking at his notes, he read carefully: ""John Enborg...age sixty-four...married...three children...lives in Jamaica, Queens...You got that?"" he said, then proceeded: ""And Herbert Anderson...age twenty-five...unmarried...lives with his mother...841 Southern Boulevard, the Bronx...Have yuh got it? Sure. Oh, sure!",1
4081,"Once more he looked round, then lowered his voice before he spoke again:  ""No, they couldn't get 'em out. They was both on the elevators, goin' up to get the tenants--see!--when some excited fool fumbled for the light switches and grabbed the wrong one and shut the current off on 'em... Sure. That's the idea. They got caught between the floors... They just got Enborg out,"" his voice sank lower. They had to use axes...Sure. Sure. He nodded into the mouthpiece. That's it--smoke. Too late when they got to him... No, that's all. Just those two...No, they don't know about it yet. Nobody knows. The management wants to keep it quiet if they can... What's that? Hey!--speak louder, can't yuh? You're mumblin' at me!",1
4082,"He had shouted sharply, irritably, into the instrument, and now listened attentively for a moment. Yeh, it's almost over. But it's been tough. They had trouble gettin' at it. It started in the basement, then it went up a flue and out at the top...Sure, I know,"" he nodded. That's what made it so tough. Two levels of tracks are right below. They were afraid to flood the basement at first--afraid to risk it. They tried to get at it with chemicals, but couldn't... Yeh, so they turned off the juice down there and put the water on it. They probably got trains backed up all the way to Albany by now...Sure, they're pumpin' it out. It's about over, I guess, but it's been tough... O.K., Mac. Want me to stick around?...O.K.,"" he said, and hung up.",1
4083,"21. Love Is Not Enough The fire was over. Mrs. Jack and those who were with her went out on the street when they heard the first engine leaving. And there on the pavement were Mr. Jack, Edith, and Alma. They had met some old friends at the hotel and had left Amy and her companions with them.",1
4084,"Mr. Jack looked in good spirits, and his manner showed, mildly and pleasantly, that he had partaken of convivial refreshment. Over his arm he was carrying a woman's coat, which he now slipped round his wife's shoulders, saying:  ""Mrs. Feldman sent you this, Esther. She said you could send it back to-morrow. All this time she had had on nothing but her evening dress.",1
4085,"She had remembered to tell the servants to wear their coats, but both she and Miss Mandell had forgotten theirs. How sweet of her!"" cried Mrs. Jack, her face beginning to glow as she thought how kind everyone was in a time of stress. Aren't people good? Other refugees, too, were beginning to straggle back now and were watching from the corner, where the police still made them wait.",1
4086,"Most of the fire-engines had already gone, and the rest were throbbing quietly with a suggestion of departure. One by one the great trucks thundered away. And presently the policemen got the signal to let the tenants return to their rooms.",1
4087,"Stephen Hook said good night and walked off, and the others started across the street towards the building. From all directions people were now streaming through the arched entrances into the court, collecting maids, cooks, and chauffeurs as they came. An air of disorder and authority had been re-established among them, and one could hear masters and mistresses issuing commands to their servants. The cloister-like arcades were filled with men and women shuffling quietly into their entryways.",1
4088,The spirit of the crowd was altogether different now from what it had been a few hours earlier. All these people had recaptured their customary assurance and poise. The informality and friendliness that they had shown to one another during the excitement had vanished. It was almost as if they were now a little ashamed of the emotions which had betrayed them into injudicious cordialities and unwonted neighbourliness. Each little family group had withdrawn frigidly into its own separate entity and was filing back into its own snug cell.,1
4089,"In the Jacks' entry a smell of smoke, slightly stale and acrid, still clung to the walls, but the power had been restored and the elevator was running again. Mrs. Jack noticed with casual surprise that the doorman, Henry, took them up, and she asked if Herbert had gone home. He paused just perceptibly, and then answered in a flat tone:",1
4090,"Yes, Mrs. Jack. You all must be simply worn out! she said warmly, with her instant sympathy. Hasn't it been a thrilling evening? she went on eagerly. In all your life did you ever know of such excitement, such confusion, as we had to-night? Yes, ma'am,"" the man said, in a voice so curiously unyielding that she felt stopped and baffled by it, as she had many times before.",1
4091,"And she thought:  ""What a strange man he is! And what a difference between people! Herbert is so warm, so jolly, so human. You can talk to him. But this one--he's so stiff and formal you can never get inside of him. And if you try to speak to him, he snubs you--puts you in your place as if he doesn't want to have anything to do with you. She felt wounded, rebuffed, almost angry.",1
4092,"She was herself a friendly person, and she liked people round her to be friendly, too--even the servants. But already her mind was worrying loosely at the curious enigma of the doorman's personality:  ""I wonder what's wrong with him,"" she thought. He seems always so unhappy, so disgruntled, nursing some secret grievance all the time. I wonder what has done it to him. Oh, well, poor thing, I suppose the life he leads is enough to turn anyone sour--opening doors and calling cabs and helping people in and out of cars and answering questions all night long. But then, Herbert has it even worse--shut up in this stuffy elevator and riding up and down all the time where he can't see anything and where nothing ever happens--and yet he's always so sweet and so obliging about everything!",1
4093,"And, giving partial utterance to her thoughts, she said:  ""I suppose Herbert had a harder time of it to-night than any of you, getting all these people out. Henry made no answer whatever. He simply seemed not to have heard her. He had stopped the elevator and opened the door at their own landing, and now said in his hard, expressionless voice: ""This is your floor, Mrs. Jack. After they got out and the car had gone down, she was so annoyed that she turned to her family and guests with flaming cheeks, and said angrily:  ""Honestly, that fellow makes me tired!",1
4094,"He's such a grouch! And he's getting worse every day! It's got so now he won't even answer when you speak to him!""  ""Well, Esther, maybe he's tired out to-night,"" suggested Mr. Jack pacifically.",1
4095,"They've all been under a pretty severe strain, you know. So I suppose that's our fault?"" said Mrs. Jack ironically. And then, going into the living-room and seeing again the chaos left there by Mr. Logan's performance, she had a sudden flare of her quick and jolly wit, and with a comical shrug said: ""Vell, ve should have a fire sale!""--which restored her to good humour.",1
4096,"Everything seemed curiously unchanged--curiously, because so much had happened since their excited departure. The place smelled close and stale, and there was still a faint tang of smoke. Mrs. Jack told Nora to open the windows. Then the three maids automatically resumed their interrupted routine and quickly tidied up the room.",1
4097,"Mrs. Jack excused herself for a moment and went into her own room. She took off the borrowed coat and hung it in the closet, and carefully brushed and adjusted her somewhat disordered hair. Then she went over to the window, threw up the sash as far as it would go, and filled her lungs full of the fresh, invigorating air. She found it good. The last taint of smoke was washed clean and sweet away by the cool breath of October. And in the white light of the moon the spires and ramparts of Manhattan were glittering with cold magic. Peace fell upon her spirit. Strong comfort and assurance bathed her whole being. Life was so solid and splendid, and so good.",1
4098,"A tremor, faint and instant, shook her feet. She paused, startled; waited, listening...Was the old trouble with George there again to shake the deep perfection of her soul? He had been strangely quiet to-night. Why, he had hardly said two words all evening. What was the matter with him?... And what was the rumour she had heard this night? Something about stocks falling. During the height of the party she had overheard Lawrence Hirsch say something like that. She hadn't paid any attention at the time, but now it came back. Faint tremors in the market""--that's what he had said. What was this talk of tremors?  --Ah, there it was a second time!",1
4099,"What was it?  --Trains again! It passed, faded, trembled delicately away into securities of eternal stone, and left behind the blue dome of night, and of October. The smile came back into her eyes. The brief and troubled frown had lifted. Her look as she turned and started towards the living-room was almost dulcet and cherubic--the look of a good child who ends the great adventure of another day.",1
4100,"Edith and Alma had retired immediately on coming in, and Lily Mandell, who had gone into one of the bedrooms to get her wraps, now came out wearing her splendid cape. Darling, it has been too marvellous,"" she said throatily, wearily, giving Mrs. Jack an affectionate kiss. Fire, smoke, Piggy Logan, everything--I've simply adored it!""  Mrs. Jack shook with laughter.",1
4101,Your parties are too wonderful! Miss Mandell concluded. You never know what's going to happen next! With that she said her good-byes and left.,1
4102,"George was also going now, but Mrs. Jack took him by the hand and said coaxingly:  ""Don't go yet. Stay a few minutes and talk to me. Mr. Jack was obviously ready for his bed.",1
4103,"He kissed his wife lightly on the cheek, said good night casually to George, and went to his room. Young men could come, and young men could go, but Mr. Jack was going to get his sleep. Outside, the night was growing colder, with a suggestion of frost in the air. The mammoth city lay fathoms deep in sleep. The streets were deserted, save for an occasional taxi-cab that drilled past on some urgent nocturnal quest. The pavements were vacant and echoed hollowly to the footfalls of a solitary man who turned the corner into Park and headed briskly north towards home and bed. The lights were out in all the towering office buildings, except for a single window high up in the face of a darkened cliff which betrayed the presence of some faithful slave of business who was working through the night upon a dull report that had to be ready in the morning.",1
4104,"At the side entrance of the great apartment house, on the now empty cross street, one of the dark green ambulances of the police department had slid up very quietly and was waiting with a softly throbbing motor. No one was watching it. Shortly a door which led down to a basement opened. Two policemen came out, bearing a stretcher, which had something sheeted on it that was very still. They slid this carefully away into the back of the green ambulance.",1
4105,"A minute later the basement door opened again and a sergeant emerged. He was followed by two more men in uniform who carried a second stretcher with a similar burden. This, too, was carefully disposed of in the same way.",1
4106,"The doors of the vehicle dicked shut. The driver and another man walked round and got into the front seat. And after a hushed word or two with the sergeant, they drove off quietly, turning the corner with a subdued clangour of bells.",1
4107,"The three remaining officers spoke together for a moment longer in lowered voices, and one of them wrote down notes in his little book. Then they said good night, saluted, and departed, each walking off in a different direction to take up again his appointed round of duty. Meanwhile, inside the imposing front entrance, under a light within the cloistered walk, another policeman was conferring with the doorman, Henry. The doorman answered the questions of the officer in a toneless, monosyllabic, sullen voice, and the policeman wrote down the answers in another little book.",1
4108,"You say the younger one was unmarried? Yes.""  ""How old?""  ""Twenty-five.""  ""And where did he live? In the Bronx.",1
4109,"His tone was so low and sullen that it was hardly more than a mutter, and the policeman lifted his head from the book and rasped out harshly:  ""Where?""  ""The Bronx!"" said Henry furiously. The man finished writing in his book, put it away into his pocket, then in a tone of casual speculation he said:  ""Well, I wouldn't want to live up there, would you? It's too damn far away. Nah!"" snapped Henry.",1
4110,"Then, turning impatiently away, he began: ""If that's all you want----""  ""That's all,"" the policeman cut in with brutal and ironic geniality. That's all, brother.",1
4111,"And with a hard look of mirth in his cold eyes, he swung his nightstick behind him and watched the retreating figure of the doorman as it went inside and disappeared in the direction of the elevator. Up in the Jack's living-room, George and Esther were alone together. There was now an air of finality about everything. The party was over, the fire was over, all the other guests had gone.",1
4112,"Esther gave a little sigh and sat down beside George. For a moment she looked round her with an expression of thoughtful appraisal. Everything was just the same as it had always been. If anyone came in here now, he would never dream that anything had happened.",1
4113,"Wasn't it all strange? she said musingly. The party--and then the fire!...I mean, the way it happened. Her tone had grown a little vague, as if there was something she could not quite express. I don't know, but the way we were all sitting here after Mr. Logan's performance...then all of a sudden the fire-engines going past...and we didn't know...we thought they were going somewhere else. There was something so--sort of weird--about it. Her brow was furrowed with her difficulty as she tried to define the emotion she felt. It sort of frightens you, doesn't it?--No, not the fire! she spoke quickly. That didn't amount to anything. No one got hurt. It was terribly exciting, really... What I mean is""--again the vague and puzzled tone--""when you think of how...big...things have got...I mean, the way people live nowadays...in these big buildings...and how a fire can break out in the very house you live in, and you not even know about it... There's something sort of terrible in that, isn't there?...And God! she burst out with sudden eagerness. In all your life did you ever see the like of them? I mean the kind of people who live here--they way they all looked as they poured out into the court? She laughed and paused, then took his hand, and with a rapt look on her face she whispered tenderly:",1
4114,"But what do they matter?...They're all gone now... The whole world's gone...There's no one left but you and I... Do you know,"" she said quietly, ""that I think about you all the time? When I wake up in the morning the first thought that comes into my head is you. And from that moment on I carry you round inside me all day long--here. She laid her hand upon her breast, then went on in a rapt whisper: ""You fill my life, my heart, my spirit, my whole being. Oh, do you think there ever was another love like ours since the world began--two other people who ever loved each other as we do? If I could play, I'd make of it great music. If I could sing, I'd make of it a great song. If I could write, I'd make of it a great story. But when I try to play or write or sing, I can think of nothing else but you...Did you know that I once tried to write a story! Smiling, she inclined her rosy face towards his: ""Didn't I ever tell you? He shook his head.",1
4115,"I was sure that it would make a wonderful story,"" she went on eagerly. It seemed to fill me up. I was ready to burst with it. But when I tried to write it, all that I could say was: 'Long, long into the night I lay--thinking of you.' She laughed suddenly, richly.",1
4116,"And that's as far as I could get. But wasn't it a grand beginning for a story? And now at night when I try to go to sleep, that one line of the story that I couldn't write comes back to me and haunts me, and keeps ringing in my ears. 'Long, long into the night I lay--thinking of you.' For that's the story. She moved closer to him, and lifted her lips to his.",1
4117,"Ah, dearest, that's the story. In the whole world there's nothing more. Love is enough. He could not answer.",1
4118,"For as she spoke he knew that for him it was not the story. He felt desolate and tired. The memory of all their years of love, of beauty and devotion, of pain and conflict, together with all her faith and tenderness and noble loyalty--the whole universe of love which had been his, all that the tenement of flesh and one small room could hold--returned to rend him in this instant.",1
4119,"For he had learned to-night that love was not enough. There had to be a higher devotion than all the devotions of this fond imprisonment. There had to be a larger world than this glittering fragment of a world with all its wealth and privilege. Throughout his whole youth and early manhood, this very world of beauty, ease, and luxury, of power, glory, and security, had seemed the ultimate end of human ambition, the furthermost limit to which the aspirations of any man could reach. But to-night, in a hundred separate moments of intense reality, it had revealed to him its very core. He had seen it naked, with its guards down. He had sensed how the hollow pyramid of a false social structure had been erected and sustained upon a base of common mankind's blood and sweat and agony. So now he knew that if he was ever to succeed in writing the books he felt were in him, he must turn about and lift his face up to some nobler height.",1
4120,"He thought about the work he wanted to do. Somehow the events which he had witnessed here to-night had helped to resolve much of his inner chaos and confusion. Many of the things which had been complex before were now made simple. And it all boiled down to this: honesty, sincerity, no compromise with truth--those were the essentials of any art--and a writer, no matter what else he had, was just a hack without them.",1
4121,"And that was where Esther and this world of hers came in. In America, of all places, there could be no honest compromise with special privilege. Privilege and truth could not lie down together. He thought of how a silver dollar, if held close enough to the eye, could blot out the sun itself. There were stronger, deeper tides and currents running in America than any which these glamorous lives to-night had ever plumbed or even dreamed of. Those were the depths that he would like to sound.",1
4122,"As he thought these things, a phrase that had been running through his head all evening, like an overtone to everything that he had seen and heard, now flashed once more into his consciousness:  --He who lets himself be whored by fashion will be whored by time. Well, then--a swift thrust of love and pity pierced him as Esther finished speaking and he looked down at her enraptured, upturned face--it must be so: he to his world, she to hers. But to-night. He could not tell her so to-night. To-morrow----  Yes, to-morrow he would tell her.",1
4123,"It would be better so. He would tell it to her straight, the way he understood it now--tell it so she could not fail to understand it, too. But tell it--get it over with--to-morrow.",1
4124,"And to make it easier, for her as well as for himself, there was one thing he would not tell her. It would be surer, swifter, kinder, not to tell her that he loved her still, that he would always love her, that no one else could ever take her place. Not by so much as a glance, a single word, the merest pressure of the hand, must he let her know that this was the hardest thing he would ever have to do. It would be far better if she did not know that, for if she knew, she'd never understand----  --Never understand to-morrow----  --That a tide was running in the hearts of men----",1
4125,"--And he must go. They said little more that night. In a few minutes he got up, and with a sick and tired heart he went away.",1
4126,"BOOK III. - AN END AND A BEGINNING When a cicada comes out of the ground to enter the last stage of its life cycle, it looks more like a fat, earth-stained grub-worm than a winged thing. Laboriously it climbs up the trunk of a tree, pulling itself along on legs that hardly seem to belong to it, for they move with painful awkwardness as though the creature had not yet got the hang of how to use them. At last it stops in its weary climb and clings to the bark by its front feet. Then, suddenly, there is a little popping sound, and one notices that the creature's outer garment has split down the back, as neatly as though it had come equipped with a zipper. Slowly now the thing inside begins to emerge, drawing itself out through the opening until it has freed its body, head, and all its members. Slowly, slowly, it accomplishes this amazing task, and slowly creeps out into a patch of sun, leaving behind the brown and lifeless husk from which it came.",1
4127,"The living, elemental protoplasm, translucent, pale green now, remains motionless for a long time in the sun, but if one has the patience to watch it further, one will see the miracle of change and growth enacted before his very eyes. After a while the body begins to pulse with life, it flattens out and changes colour like a chameleon, and from small sprouts on each side of the back the wings commence to grow. Quickly, quickly now, they lengthen out--one can see it happening!--until they become transparent fairy wings, iridescent, shimmering in the sun. They begin to quiver delicately, then more rapidly, and all at once, with a metallic whirring sound, they cut the air and the creature flashes off, a new-born thing released into a new element.",1
4128,"America, in the autumn of 1929, was like a cicada. It had come to an end and a beginning. On October 24th, in New York, in a marble-fronted building down in Wall Street, there was a sudden crash that was heard throughout the land. The dead and outworn husk of the America that had been had cracked and split right down the back, and the living, changing, suffering thing within--the real America, the America that had always been, the America that was yet to be--began now slowly to emerge. It came forth into the light of day, stunned, cramped, crippled by the bonds of its imprisonment, and for a long time it remained in a state of suspended animation, full of latent vitality, waiting, waiting patiently, for the next stage of its metamorphosis.",1
4129,"The leaders of the nation had fixed their gaze so long upon the illusions of a false prosperity that they had forgotten what America looked like. Now they saw it--saw its newness, its raw crudeness, and its strength--and turned their shuddering eyes away. Give us back our well-worn husk,"" they said, ""where we were so snug and comfortable. And then they tried word-magic. Conditions are fundamentally sound,"" they said--by which they meant to reassure themselves that nothing now was really changed, that things were as they always had been, and as they always would be, for ever and ever, amen.",1
4130,"But they were wrong. They did not know that you can't go home again. America bad come to the end of something, and to the beginning of something else. But no one knew what that something else would be, and out of the change and the uncertainty and the wrongness of the leaders grew fear and desperation, and before long hunger stalked the streets. Through it all there was only one certainty, though no one saw it yet. America was still America, and whatever new thing came of it would be American.",1
4131,"George Webber was just as confused and fearful as everybody else. If anything, he was more so, because, in addition to the general crisis, he was caught in a personal one as well. For at this very time he, too, had come to an end and a beginning. It was an end of love, though not of loving; a beginning of recognition, though not of fame. His book was published early in November, and that event, so eagerly awaited for so long, produced results quite different from any he had expected. And during this period of his life he learned a great deal that he had never known before, but it was only gradually, in the course of the years to come, that he began to realise how the changes in himself were related to the larger changes in the world around him.",1
4132,"22. A Question of Guilt Throughout George Webber's boyhood in the little town of Libya Hill, when the great vision of the city burned for ever in his brain, he had been athirst for glory and had wanted very much to be a famous man. That desire had never changed, except to become stronger as he grew older, until now he wanted it more than ever. Yet, of the world of letters in which he dreamed of cutting a great figure, he knew almost nothing. He was now about to find out a few things that were to rob his ignorance of its bliss.",1
4133,"His novel, Home to Our Mountains, was published the first week in November 1929. The date, through the kind of accidental happening which so often affects the course of human events, and which, when looked back on later, seems to have been attended by an element of fatality, coincided almost exactly with the beginning of the Great American Depression. The collapse of the Stock Market, which had begun in late October, was in some ways like the fall of a gigantic boulder into the still waters of a lake. The suddenness of it sent waves of desperate fear moving in ever-widening circles throughout America. Millions of people in the far-off hamlets, towns, and cities did not know what to make of it. Would its effects touch them? They hoped not. And the waters of the lake closed over the fallen boulder, and for a while most Americans went about their day's work just as usual.",1
4134,"But the waves of fear had touched them, and life was not quite the same. Security was gone, and there was a sense of dread and ominous foreboding in the air. It was into this atmosphere of false calm and desperate anxiety that Webber's book was launched.",1
4135,"It is no part of the purpose of this narrative to attempt to estimate the merits or deficiences of Home to Our Mountains. It need only be said here that it was a young man's first book, and that it had a good many of the faults and virtues of the kind of thing it was. Webber had done what so many beginning writers do: he had written it out of the experience of his own life. And that got him into a lot of trouble.",1
4136,"He was to become convinced as he grew older that if one wants to write a book that has any interest or any value whatever, he has got to write it out of the experience of life. A writer, like everybody else must use what he has to use. He can't use something that he hasn't got. If he tries to--and many writers have tried it--what he writes is no good. Everybody knows that.",1
4137,"So Webber had drawn upon the experience of his own life. He had written about his home town, about his family and the people he had known there. And he, had done it in a manner of naked directness and reality that was rather rare in books. That was really what caused the trouble.",1
4138,"Every author's first book is important. It means the world to him. Perhaps he thinks that what he has done has never been done before. Webber thought so. And in a way he was right. He was still very much under the influence of James Joyce, and what he had written was a Ulysses kind of book. People at home, whose good opinion he coveted more than that of all the rest of the world combined, were bewildered and overwhelmed by it. They, of course, had not read Ulysses. And Webber had not read people. He thought he had, he thought he knew what they were like, but he really didn't. He hadn't learned what a difference there is between living with them and writing about them.",1
4139,"A man learns a great deal about life from writing and publishing a book. When Webber wrote his, he had ripped off a mask that his home town had always worn, but he had not quite understood that he was doing it. Only after it was printed and published did he fully realise the fact. All he had meant and hoped to do was to tell the truth about life as he had known it. But no sooner was the thing done--the proofs corrected, the pages printed beyond recall--than he knew that he had not told the truth. Telling the truth is a pretty hard thing. And in a young man's first attempt, with the distortions of his vanity, egotism, hot passion, and lacerated pride, it is almost impossible. Home to Our Mountains was marred by all these faults and imperfections. Webber knew this better than anybody else, and long before any reader had a chance to tell him so. He did not know whether he had written a great book--sometimes he thought he had, or at least that there were elements of greatness in it. He did know that it was not altogether a true book. Still, there was truth in it. And this was what people were afraid of. This was what made them mad.",1
4140,"As the publication day drew near, Webber felt some apprehension about the reception of his novel in Libya Hill. Ever since his trip home in September he had had a heightened sense of uneasiness and anxiety. He had seen the boom-mad town tottering on the brink of ruin. He had read in the eyes of people on the streets the fear and guilty knowledge of the calamity that impended and that they were still refusing to admit even to themselves. He knew that they were clinging desperately to the illusion of their paper riches, and that madness such as this was unprepared to face reality and truth in any degree whatever.",1
4141,"But even if he had been unaware of these special circumstances of the moment, he would still have had some premonitory consciousness that he was in for something. For he was a Southerner, and he knew that there was something wounded in the South. He knew that there was something twisted, dark, and full of pain which Southerners have known with all their lives--something rooted in their souls beyond all contradiction, about which no one had dared to write, of which no one had ever spoken.",1
4142,"Perhaps it came from their old war, and from the ruin of their great defeat and its degraded aftermath. Perhaps it came from causes yet more ancient--from the evil of man's slavery, and the hurt and shame of human conscience in its struggle with the fierce desire to own. It came, too, perhaps, from the lusts of the hot South, tormented and repressed below the harsh and outward patterns of a bigot and intolerant theology, yet prowling always, stirring stealthily, as hushed and secret as the thickets of swamp-darkness. And most of all, perhaps, it came out of the very weather of their lives, out of the forms that shaped them and the food that fed them, out of the unknown terrors of the skies above them, out of the dark, mysterious pineland all round them with its haunting sorrow.",1
4143,"Wherever it came from, it was there--and Webber knew it. But it was not only in the South that America was hurt. There was another deeper, darker, and more nameless wound throughout the land. What was it? Was it in the record of corrupt officials and polluted governments, administrations twisted to the core, the huge excess of privilege and graft, protected criminals and gangster rule, the democratic forms all rotten and putrescent with disease? Was it in ""puritanism""--that great, vague name: whatever it may be? Was it in the bloated surfeits of monopoly, and the crimes of wealth against the worker's life? Yes, it was in all of these, and in the daily tolling of the murdered men, the lurid renderings of promiscuous and casual slaughter everywhere throughout the land, and in the pious hypocrisy of the Press with its swift-forgotten prayers for our improvement, the editorial moaning while the front page gloats.",1
4144,"But it is not only at these outward forms that we must look to find the evidence of a nation's hurt. We must look as well at the heart of guilt that beats in each of us, for there the cause lies. We must look, and with our own eyes see, the central core of defeat and shame and failure which we have wrought in the lives of even the least of these, our brothers. And why must we look? Because we must probe to the bottom of our collective wound. As men, as Americans, we can no longer cringe away and lie. Are we not all warmed by the same sun, frozen by the same cold, shone on by the same lights of time and terror here in America? Yes, and if we do not look and see it, we shall be all damned together.",1
4145,"So George Webber had written a book in which he had tried, with only partial success, to tell the truth about the little segment of life that he had seen and known. And now he was worried about what the people back in his home town would think of it. He thought a few of them would ""read it"". He was afraid there would be ""talk"". He supposed that there might even be a protest here and there, and he tried to prepare himself for it. But when it came, it went so far beyond anything he had feared might happen that it caught him wholly unawares and almost floored him. He had felt, but had not known before, how naked we are here in America.",1
4146,"It was a time when the better-known gentlemen and lady authors of the South were writing polished bits of whimsey about some dear Land of Far Cockaigne, or ironic little comedies about the gentle relics of the Old Tradition in the South, or fanciful bits about Negro mongrels along the Battery in Charleston, or, if passion was in the air, amusing and light-hearted tales about the romantic adulteries of dusky brethren and their ""high-yaller gals"" on a plantation somewhere. There wasn't much honesty or essential reality in these books, and the people who wrote them had not made much effort to face the facts in the life round them. One wrote about Cockaigne because it was far enough away to be safe; and if one wanted to write about adultery, or about crime and punishment of any sort, it was a good deal safer to let it happen to a group of darkies than to the kind of people one had to live with every day.",1
4147,"Home to Our Mountains was a novel that did not fit into any of these standardised patterns. It didn't seem to have much pattern at all. The people of Libya Hill hardly knew what to make of it at first. Then they recognised themselves in it. From that point on, they began to live it all over again. People who had never bought a book before bought this one. Libya Hill alone bought two thousand copies of it. It stunned them, it overwhelmed them, and in the end it made them fight.",1
4148,"For George Webber had used the scalpel in a way that that section of the country was not accustomed to. His book took the hide off of the whole community, and as a result of this it also took the hide off of George Webber. In Libya Hill, a day or two before the publication of the book, Margaret Shepperton met Harley McNabb on the street. They exchanged greetings and stopped to talk.",1
4149,"Have you seen the book?"" he said. Yes, George sent me an advance copy,"" she answered, beaming at him, ""and he signed it for me, too. But I haven't read it. It just came this morning. Have you seen it?""  ""Yes,"" he said.",1
4150,"We have a review copy in the office. What do you think of it? She looked at him with the expression of a large and earnest woman who lets herself be governed considerably by the opinion of those round her mean--""now you've been to college, Harley,"" she began jestingly, but also rather eagerly. It may be deep stuff to me--but you ought to know--you're educated--you ought to be a judge about these things. What I mean is, do you think it's good? He was silent for a moment, his lean hand fingering the bowl of his blackened briar, on which he puffed thoughtfully.",1
4151,"Then:  ""Margaret,"" he said, ""it's pretty rough...Now don't get excited,"" he added quickly as he saw her large face contract with anxiety and concern. No use getting excited about it--but""--he paused, puffing on his pipe, his eyes staring off into vacancy--""there--there are some pretty rough things in it. It's--it's pretty frank, Margaret. She felt the gathering in her of sharp tensions, a white terror, personal, immediate, as she said almost hoarsely:  ""About me?",1
4152,"About me, Harley? Is that what you mean? Are there things in it--about me? Her face was tortured now, and she felt an indescribable sense of fear and guilt.",1
4153,"Not only about you,"" he said. About--well, Margaret, about everybody--about a lot of people here in town... You've known him all your life, haven't you? You see--well--he's put in everybody he ever knew. Some of it is going to be pretty hard to take. For a moment, in a phrase she was fond of using, she ""went all to pieces"".",1
4154,"She began to talk wildly, incoherently, her large features contorted under the strain: Well, now, I'm sure I don't know what he's got to say about me!... Well, now, if anyone feels that way--"" without knowing how anyone felt. What I mean to say is, I certainly don't feel that I've got anything to be ashamed of... You know me, Harley,"" she went on eagerly, almost beseechingly, ""I'm known in this town--I've got friends here--everybody knows me... Well, I certainly have nothing to conceal. I know you haven't, Margaret,"" he said.",1
4155,"Only--well, there's going to be talk. She felt emptied out, hollow, her knees were weak. His words had almost knocked her over. If he said it, it must be so, even though she did not yet understand what it was he had said. She only knew that she was in the book, and that Harley didn't like it; and his opinion stood for something, for a great deal, in her own eyes and in the eyes of the whole town. He represented what her mind called, somewhat vaguely, ""the high-brow element"". He had always been ""a fine man"". He stood for truth, for culture, for learning, and for high integrity. So she looked at him with her bewildered face and stricken eyes, and, just as a young soldier, with his entrails shot out in his hands, speaks to the commander of his life, saying in his deadly fear and peril: ""Is it bad, General? Do you think it's bad?""--so now she said hoarsely to the editor, hanging on his words:  ""Harley, do you think it's bad?""  He looked away again into blue vacancy and puffed gravely on his pipe before he answered:",1
4156,"It's pretty bad, Margaret...But don't worry. We'll see what happens. Then he was gone, leaving her alone there, bleakly staring at the pavement of the small, familiar street.",1
4157,"Unseen motes of the familiar life swept round her, the pale light of the sun fell on her, and she remained there staring with gaunt face. How much time went by she did not know, but all at once----  ""0 Margaret! At the lush voice, sugared with the honey of its owner's sweetness, she turned, blindly smiling, and stiffly blurted out a word of greeting.",1
4158,"Aren't you just so proud of him? He always liked you better than anybody else! Aren't you simply thrilled to death? The voice rose to a honeyed lilt, and in the pale light the face was now shaped into the doelike contours of a china doll. I'll declayah! I'm so thrilled! I know you must be walkin' on ayah! Why, I just cain't wait! I'm just dyin' to read it! I know that you're the proudest thing that evah lived! Margaret stammered out something through stiff, smiling lips, and then was left alone again, her big gaunt face strained into vacancy.",1
4159,"She went about the business that had brought her to town. She went through the motions automatically. And all the while she was thinking:  ""So, he's written about us!",1
4160,"That's what it is! Her mind rushed furiously on through a chaos of unresolved emotions. Well, I'm sure I don't know what it's all about, but there's one thing certain--my conscience is clear. If anyone thinks they've got anything on me, they're very much mistaken... Now, if he wants to criticise me""--in her mind the word implied a derogatory appraisal of a person's life and conduct--""why he can go right ahead. I've lived all my life in this town, and everybody knows--no matter what anybody says--that I've never done anything immoral. By this word she meant solely and simply a deviation from the standards of sexual chastity. Now I'm sure I don't know what Harley meant by its being hard to take and people will talk, but I know I've got nothing to be ashamed about...""  Her mind was full of frantic questions.",1
4161,"A hundred apprehensions, fears, and terrors swept through her. But through it all there were shafts of stubborn strength and loyalty:  ""Whatever it's about, I know there can't be any harm in it. We've all done things we're sorry for, but we're not bad people, any of us. No one I know is really very bad. He couldn't harm us if he wanted to. And,"" she added, ""he wouldn't want to. To her brother, Randy, when he came home that night, she said:  ""Well, we're in for it!...I saw Harley McNabb on the street and he said the book is pretty bad...",1
4162,"Now, I don't know what he said about you--Ho! Ho! Ho!--but my conscience is clear!""  Randy followed her back to the kitchen and they talked about it long and earnestly while Margaret cooked supper. They were both puzzled and bewildered by what McNabb had said. Neither of them had yet read the book, so they searched their memories for all sorts of things that might be in it, but they couldn't imagine what it was. Supper was late that night, and when Margaret brought it to the table it was burned.",1
4163,"Three weeks later, in New York, George sat in the back room of his dismal flat on Twelfth Street, reading his morning mail. He had always wanted letters. Now he had them. It seemed to him that all the letters he had been waiting for all his life, all the letters he had longed for, all the letters that had never come, had now descended in a flood.",1
4164,"He remembered all the years, all the weary and unnumbered days and hours of waiting, after he had first left home for college. He remembered that first year away from home, his freshman year, and how it seemed to him that he was always waiting for a letter that never came. He remembered how the students gathered for their mail twice a day, at noon and then again at night when they had finished dinner. He remembered the dingy little post office on the main street of the little college town, and the swarm of students shuffling in and out--the whole street dense with them, the dingy little post office packed with them, opening their boxes, taking out their mail, milling round the delivery window.",1
4165,"Everyone, it seemed, got letters except himself. Here were boys packed in the corners, leaning against the walls, propped up against trees, squatted on steps and porch rails and the verandas of fraternity houses, walking oblivious across the village street--all immersed, all reading, all buried in their letters. Here was the boy who had only one girl and wanted no one but the girl he had, who had wormed himself away into a corner, just out of contact with that noisy and good-natured crowd, where he read slowly, carefully, word for word, the letter that she wrote him every day. Here was another lad, a sleek and handsome youth, one of the Casanovas of the campus, walking along and skimming the contents of a dozen scented epistles, shuffling through the pages and responding with a touch of complaisant satisfaction to the gibes of his fellows over his latest conquest. Here were boys reading letters from their friends, from boys in other colleges, from older brothers and from younger sisters, from fathers, mothers, and from favourite aunts and uncles. From all these people these boys received the tokens of friendship, kinship, fellowship, and love--the emotions that give a man his place, that secure him in the confident, brave knowledge of his home, that wall his soul about with comfort, and that keep him from the desolation of an utter nakedness, from the dreadful sense of his atomic nullity in the roofless openness of life.",1
4166,"It seemed to him that everyone had this, except himself. And, later, he remembered his first years in the city, his years of wandering, his first years of living utterly alone. Here, too, even more than in his college days, it seemed to him that he was always waiting for a letter that never came. That was the time when he had eaten out his heart at night in the cell-like privacy of little rooms. That was the time when he had beaten his knuckles raw and bloody at the walls that hemmed him in. That was the time--and it was ten thousand times of longing, disappointment, bitter grief, and loneliness--when his unresting mind had written to himself the letters that never came. Letters from the noble, loyal, and gracious people he had never known. Letters from the heroic and great-hearted friends that he had never had. Letters from the faithful kinsmen, neighbours, schoolmates who had all forgotten him.",1
4167,"Well, he had them now--all of them--and he had not foreseen it. He sat there in his room and read them, numb in the city's roar. Two shafts of light sank through the windows to the floor. Outside, the cat crept trembling at his merciless stride along the ridges of the back-yard fence.",1
4168,"Anonymous, in pencil, on a sheet of ruled tablet paper:  ""Well author old lady Flood went away to Florida yestiddy after a so-called litterary book arrived from a so-called author that she thought she knew. Oh God how can you have this crime upon your soal. I left your pore dere aunt Maggie lying on her back in bed white as a sheet where she will never rise again where you have put her with your murder pen. Your dere friend Margaret Shepperton who was always like a sister to you is ruined and disgraced for life you have made her out no better than a wanton woman. You have murdered and disgraced your friends never come back here you are the same as dead to all of us we never want to see your face again. I never believed in linch law but if I saw a mob drag that monkeyfied karkus of yours across the Public Square I would not say a word. How can you sleep at night with this crime upon your soal. Destroy this vile and dirty book at once let no more copies be published the crime that you have done is worse than Cain. On a postcard, sealed in an envelope:  ""We'll kill you if you ever come back here.",1
4169,"You know who. From an old friend:  ""My dear boy,  ""What is there to say? It has come, it is here, it has happened--and now I can only say, as that good woman who brought you up and now lies dead and buried on the hill would have said: '0 God! If I had only known!' For weeks I have waited for nothing else except the moment when your book should come and I should have it in my hands. Well, it has come now. And what is there to say?",1
4170,"You have crucified your family in a way that would make the agony of Christ upon the Cross seem light in the comparison. You have laid waste the lives of your kinsmen, and of dozens of your friends, and to us who loved you like our own you have driven a dagger to the heart, and twisted it, and left it fixed there where it must always stay. From a sly and hearty fellow who thought he understood:  ""...if I had known you were going to write this kind of book, I could have told you lots of things.",1
4171,Why didn't you come to me? I know dirt about the people in this town you never dreamed of. Letters like this last one hurt him worst of all.,1
4172,"They were the ones that made him most doubt his purpose and accomplishment. What did such people think he had been trying to write--nothing but an encyclopaedia of pornography, a kind of prurient excavation of every buried skeleton in town? He saw that his book had unreefed whole shoals of unsuspected bitterness and malice in the town and set evil tongues to wagging. The people he had drawn upon to make the characters in his book writhed like hooked fish on a line, and the others licked their lips to see them squirm.",1
4173,"Those who were the victims of all this unleashed malice now struck back, almost to a man, at the hapless author--at him whom they considered to be the sole cause of their woe. Day after day their letters came, and with a perverse satisfaction in his own suffering, a desire to take upon himself now all the searing shame that he had so naively and so unwittingly brought to others, he read and re-read every bitter word of every bitter letter, and his senses and his heart were numb. They said at first that he was a monster against life, that he had fouled his own nest. Then they said he had turned against the South, his mother, and spat upon her and defiled her. Then they levelled against him the most withering charge they could think of, and said he was ""not Southern"". Some of them even began to say that he was ""not American"". This was really rather hard on him, George thought with a wry, grim humour, for if he was not American, he was not anything at all.",1
4174,"And during those nightmarish first weeks following the publication of his book, only two rays of warmth and comforting assurance came to him from anyone he knew. One was a letter from Randy Shepperton. As a boy, and later as a student at college, Randy had possessed a spirit that always burned with the quick, pure flame of a Mercutio. And now, in spite of what life had done to him--the evidence of which George had seen in his troubled eyes and deeply furrowed face--his letter showed that he was still essentially the same old Randy. What he wrote was full of understanding about the book; he saw its purpose clearly, and he gave, George thought, a shrewd appraisal of its accomplishment and its weaknesses; and he ended with a generous burst of pride and honest pleasure in the thing itself. Not a word about personalities, not a breath of all the gossip in the town, not even a hint that he had recognised himself among the portraits George had drawn.",1
4175,"The other ray of comfort was of quite another kind. One day the telephone rang, and it was Nebraska Crane howling his friendship over the wire:  ""Hi, there, Monkus! That you? How you makin' out, boy?""  ""Oh, all right, I guess,"" George answered, in a tone of resignation which he could not conceal even in the pleasure that he felt at hearing the hearty ring of the familiar voice.",1
4176,"You sound sorta down in the mouth,"" said Nebraska, full of immediate concern. What's the matter? Ain't nothin' wrong with you, is there? Oh, no.",1
4177,"No. It's nothing. Forget it. Then, shaking off the mood that had been with him for days, he began to respond with something of the warmth he felt for his old friend. God, I'm glad to hear from you, Bras! I can't tell you how glad I am! How are you, Bras?""  ""Oh, cain't complain,"" he shouted lustily.",1
4178,"I think maybe they're gonna give me a contrack for one more year. Looks like it, anyways. If they do, we'll be all set. That's swell, Bras!",1
4179,"That's wonderful!... And how is Myrtle?""  ""Fine! Fine!...Say""--he howled--""she's here now! She's the one put me up to callin' you. I never woulda thought of it. You know me!... We been readin' all about you--about that book you wrote. Myrtle's been tellin' me about it. She's cut out all the pieces from the papers... That sure went over big, didn't it?""  ""It's doing pretty well, I suppose,"" said George without enthusiasm.",1
4180,"It seems to be selling all right, if that's what you mean. Well, now, I knowed it!"" said Nebraska. Me an' Myrtle bought a copy... I ain't read it yet,"" he added apologetically.",1
4181,"You don't have to. I'm goin' to, I'm goin' to,"" he howled vigorously. Just as soon as I git time. You're a damned liar!",1
4182,"George said good-naturedly. You know you never will!""  ""Why, I will! Nebraska solemnly declared. I'm just waitin' till I git a chance to settle down... Boy, you shore do write 'em long, don't you?""  ""Yes, it is pretty long.",1
4183,Longest darn book I ever seen! Nebraska yelled enthusiastically. Makes me tard just to tote it roun'!,1
4184,"Well, it made me tired to write it. Dogged if I don't believe you! I don't see how you ever thought up all them words... But I'm gonna read it!...Some of the boys on the Club know about it already. Jeffertz was talkin' to me about it the other day. Who?""  ""Jeffertz--Matt Jeffertz, the ketcher.",1
4185,"Has he read it?""  ""Naw, he ain't read it yet, but his wife has. She's a big book-reader an' she knows all about you. They knowed I knowed you, an' that's how come he tells me--""  ""Tells you what?",1
4186,"George broke in with a feeling of sudden panic. Why, that you got me in there! he yelled. Is that right! George reddened and began to stammer:  ""Well, Bras, you see----""  ""Well, that's what Matt's wife said!",1
4187,"Nebraska shouted at the top of his lungs, without waiting for an answer. Said I'm in there so's anyone would know me!...What'd you say about me, Monk? You sure it's me?""  ""Well--you see, now, Bras--it was like this----""  ""What's eatin' on you, boy?",1
4188,"It is me, ain't it?... Well, what d'you know?"" he yelled with evident amazement and delight. Ole Bras right there in the book! His voice grew low and more excited as, evidently turning to Myrtle, he said: ""It's me, all right! Then, to George again: ""Say, Monk""--solemnly--""you shore do make me feel mighty proud! That's what I called you up to tell you. 23.",1
4189,"The Lion Hunters In New York his book got a somewhat better reception than it 'enjoyed back home. The author was unknown. Nobody had any advance reason to care about what he had written one way or another. Though this was not exactly an asset, at least it gave the book a chance to be considered on its merits.",1
4190,"Surprisingly enough, it got pretty good reviews in most of the leading newspapers and magazines. That is, they were the kind of reviews that his publisher called ""good"". They said nice things about the book and made people want to buy it. George himself could have wished that some of the reviewing gentry, even some of those who hailed him as ""a discovery"" and studded their sentences with superlatives, had been a little more discriminating in what they said of him. Occasionally he could have asked for a little more insight into what he had been driving at. But after reading the letters from his former friends and neighbours he was in no mood to quarrel with anybody who felt disposed to speak him a soft and gentle word, and on the whole he had every reason to be well pleased with his press.",1
4191,"He read the notices avidly, feverishly, and sooner or later he must have seen them all, for his publisher showed him the clippings as they came in from every section of the country. He would take great bunches of them home to devour. When his eager eye ran upon a word of praise it was like magic to him, and he would stride about his room in a delirium of joy. When he read a savage, harsh, unfavourable review, he felt crushed: even though it came from some little rural paper in the South, his fingers would tremble, his face turn pale, and he would wad it up in his hand and curse it bitterly.",1
4192,"Whenever a notice of his work appeared in one of the best magazines or weekly journals, he could hardly bring himself to read it; neither could he go away from it and leave it unread. He would approach it as a man creeps stealthily to pick a snake up by the tail, his heart leaping at the sight of his name. He would scan the last line first, then with a rush of blood to his face he would plunge into it at once, devouring the whole of it as quickly as he could. And if he saw that it was going to be ""good"", a feeling of such powerful joy and exultancy would well up in his throat that he would want to shout his triumph from the windows. If he saw that the verdict was going to be ""thumbs down"", he would read on with agonised fascination, and his despair would be so great that he would feel he was done for, that he had been exposed to the world as a fool and a failure, and that he would never be able to write another line.",1
4193,"After the more important reviews appeared, his mail gradually took on a different complexion. Not that the flood of damning letters from home had ceased, but now, along with them, began to come messages of another kind, from utter strangers who had read his novel and liked it. The book was doing pretty well, it seemed. 'It even appeared on some of the best-seller lists, and then things really began to happen. Soon his box was stuffed with fan mail, and the telephone jingled merrily all day long with invitations from wealthy and cultivated people who wanted him for lunch, for tea, for dinner, for theatre parties, for week-ends in the country--for anything at all if he would only come.",1
4194,"Was this Fame at last? It looked so, and in the first flush of his eager belief he almost forgot about Libya Hill and rushed headlong into the welcoming arms of people he had never seen before. He accepted invitations right and left, and they kept him pretty busy. And each time he went out it seemed to him that he was on the very point of capturing all the gold and magic he had ever dreamed of finding, and that now he was really going to take a place of honour among the great ones of the city, in a life more fortunate and good than any he had ever known. He went to each encounter with each new friend as though some wonderful and intoxicating happiness were impending for him.",1
4195,"But he never found it. For, in spite of all the years he had lived in New York, he was still a country boy, and he did not know about the lion hunters. They are a peculiar race of people who inhabit the upper jungles of Cosmopolis and subsist entirely on some rarefied and ambrosial ectoplasm that seems to emanate from the arts. They love art dearly--in fact, they dote on it--and they love the artists even more. So they spend their whole lives running after them, and their favourite sport is trapping literary lions. The more intrepid hunters go after nothing but the full-grown lions, who make the most splendid trophies for exhibition purposes, but others--especially the lady hunters--would rather bag a cub. A cub, once tamed and housebroken, makes a nice pet--much nicer than a lap dog--because there's just no limit to the beguiling tricks a gentle hand can teach him.",1
4196,For a few weeks George was quite the fair-haired boy among these wealthy and cultivated people. One of his new-found friends told him about an aesthetic and high-minded millionaire who was panting with eagerness to meet him. From others came further confirmation of the fact.,1
4197,"The man is mad about your work,"" people would say to him. He's crazy to meet you. And you ought to go to see him, because a man like that might be of great help to you. They told George that this man had asked all kinds of questions about him, and had learned that he was very poor and had to work for a small salary as an instructor in the School for Utility Cultures.",1
4198,"When the millionaire heard this, his great heart began to bleed for the young author immediately. It was intolerable, he said, that such a state of affairs should exist. America was the only country in the world where it would be permitted. Anywhere in Europe--yes, even in poor little Austria!--the artist would be subsidised, the ugly threat of poverty that hung over him would be removed, his best energies would be released to do his finest work--and, by God, he was going to see that this was done for George!",1
4199,"George had never expected anything like this to happen, and he could not see why such a thing should be done for any man. Nevertheless, when he thought of this great-hearted millionaire, he burned with eagerness to meet him and began to love him like a brother. So a meeting was arranged, and George went to see him, and the man was very fine to him. The millionaire had George to his house for dinner several times and showed him off to all of his rich friends. And one lovely woman to whom the millionaire introduced the poor young author took him home with her that very night and granted him the highest favour in her keeping.",1
4200,"Then the millionaire had to go abroad on brief but urgent business. George went to the boat to see him off, and his friend shook him affectionately by the shoulder, called him by his first name, and told him that if there was anything he wanted, just to let him know by cable and he would see that it was done. He said he would be back within a month at most, and would be so busy that he wouldn't have time to write, but he would get in touch with George again as soon as he returned. With this he wrung George by the hand and sailed away.",1
4201,"A month, six weeks, two months went by, and George heard nothing from the man. It was well into the new year before he saw him again, and then by accident. A young lady had invited George to have lunch with her at an expensive speak-easy. As soon as they entered the place George saw his millionaire friend sitting alone at one of the tables. Immediately George uttered a cry of joy and started across the room to meet him with his hand outstretched, and in such precipitate haste that he fell sprawling across an intervening table and two chairs. When he picked himself up from the floor, the man had drawn back with an expression of surprise and perplexity on his face, but he unbent sufficiently to take the young man's proffered hand and to say coolly, in an amused and tolerant voice:  ""Ah--it's our writer friend again?",1
4202,"How are you?""  The young man's crestfallen confusion and embarrassment were so evident that the rich man's heart was quite touched. His distant manner thawed out instantly, and now nothing would do but that George should bring the young lady over to the millionaire's table so that they could all have lunch together. During the course of the meal the man became very friendly and attentive. It seemed he just couldn't do enough for George. He kept helping him to various dishes and filling his glass with more wine. And whenever George turned to him he would find the man looking at him with an expression of such obvious sympathy and commiseration that finally he felt compelled to ask him what the trouble was.",1
4203,"Ah,"" he said, shaking his head with a doleful sigh, ""I was mighty sorry when I read about it. Read about what?""  ""Why,"" he said, ""the prize. What prize?""  ""But didn't you read about it in the paper?",1
4204,"Didn't you see what happened?""  ""I don't know what you are talking about,"" said George, puzzled. What did happen?""  ""Why,"" he said, ""you didn't get it. Didn't get what?""  ""The prize!",1
4205,"he cried--""the prize!""--mentioning a literary prize that was awarded every year. I thought you would be sure to get it, but""--he paused a moment, then went on sorrowfully--""they gave it to another man... You got mentioned...you were runner-up...but""--he shook his head gloomily--""you didn't get it. So much for his gocd friend, the millionaire.",1
4206,"George never saw him again after that. And yet, let no one say that he was ever bitter. Then there was Dorothy.",1
4207,"Dorothy belonged to that fabulous and romantic upper crust of New York ""Society"" which sleeps by day and begins to come awake at sunset and never seems to have any existence at all outside of the better-known hot spots of the town. She had been expensively educated for a life of fashion, she had won a reputation in her set for being quite an intellectual because she had been known to read a book, and so, of course, when George Webber's novel was listed as a best seller she bought it and left it lying around in prominent places in her apartment. Then she wrote the author a scented note, asking him to come and have a cocktail with her. He did, and at her urging he went back to see her again and again.",1
4208,"Dorothy was no longer as young as she had been, but she was well built, had kept her figure and her face, and was not a bad-looking wench. She had never married, and apparently felt she did not need to, for it was freely whispered about that she seldom slept alone. One heard that she had bestowed her favours not only upon all the gentlemen of her own set, but also upon such casual gallants as the milkmen on her family's estate, stray taxi-drivers, writers of da-da, professional bicycle riders, wasteland poets, and plug-ugly bruisers with flat feet and celluloid collars. So George had expected their friendship to come quickly to its full flower, and he was quite surprised and disappointed when nothing happened.",1
4209,"His evenings with Dorothy turned out to be quiet and serious tête-à-têtes devoted to highly intellectual conversation. Dorothy remained as chaste as a nun, and George began to wonder whether she had not been grossly maligned by evil tongues. He found her intellectual and aesthetic interests rather on the dull side, and was several times on the point of giving her up in sheer boredom. But always she would pursue him, sending him notes and letters written in a microscopic hand on paper edged with red, and he would go back again, partly out of curiosity and a desire to find out what it was the woman was after.",1
4210,"He found out. Dorothy asked him to dine with her one night at a fashionable restaurant, and on this occasion she brought along her current sleeping companion, a young Cuban with patent-leather hair. George sat at the table between them. And while the Cuban gave his undivided attention to the food before him, Dorothy began to talk to George, and he learned to his chagrin that she had picked him out of all the world to be the victim of her only sacred passion.",1
4211,"I love you, Jawge,"" she leaned over and whispered loudly in her rather whiskified voice. I love you--but mah love for you is pewer! She looked at him with a soulful expression. You, Jawge--I love you for your maind,"" she rumbled on, ""for your spirit! But Miguel! Miguel!""--here her eyes roved over the Cuban as he sat tucking the food away with both hands--""Miguel--I love him for his bawd-y! He has no maind, but he has a fa-ine bawd-y,"" she whispered lustfully, ""a fa-ine beaut-iful bawd-y--so slim--so boyish--so La-tin!",1
4212,"She was silent for a moment, and when she went on it was in a tone of foreboding:  ""I wantcha to come with us to-naight, Jawge! she said abruptly. I don't know what is going to happen,"" she said ominously, ""and I wantcha nee-ah me. But what is going to happen, Dorothy?""  ""I don't know,"" she muttered.",1
4213,"I just don't know. Anything might happen!...Why, last night I thought that he was gone! We had a fight and he walked out on me! These La-tins are so proud, so sen-sitive! He caught me looking at another man, and he got up and left me flat!...If he left me I don't know what I'd do, Jawge,"" she panted. I think I'd die! I think I'd kill myself! Her eye rested broodingly upon her lover, who at this moment was bending forward with bared teeth towards the tines of his uplifted fork on which a large and toothsome morsel of broiled chicken was impaled.",1
4214,"Feeling their eyes upon him, he looked up with his fork poised in mid-air, smiled with satisfaction, then seized the bit of chicken in his jaws, took a drink to wash it down, and wiped his moist lips with a napkin. After that he elegantly lifted one hand to shield his mouth, inserted a finger-nail between his teeth, detached a fragment of his victuals, and daintily ejected it upon the floor, while his lady's fond eye doted on him. Then he picked up the fork again and resumed his delightful gastronomic labours.",1
4215,"I shouldn't worry about it, Dorothy,"" George said to her. I don't think he's going to leave you for some time. I should die!",1
4216,"she muttered. I really think that it would kill me!... Jawge, you've got to come with us to-naight! I just wantcha to be nee-ah me! I feel so safe--so secure--when you're around! You're so sawlid, Jawge--so comfawtin'! she said. I wantcha to be theah to tawk to me--to hold mah hand and comfawt me--if anything should happen,"" she said, at the same time putting her hand on his and squeezing it.",1
4217,"But George did not go with her that night, nor any night thereafter. This was the last he saw of Dorothy. But surely none can say that he was ever bitter.",1
4218,"Again, there was the rich and beautiful young widow whose husband had died just a short time before, and who mentioned this sad fact in the moving and poignantly understanding letter she wrote to George about his book. Naturally, he accepted her kind invitation to drop in for tea. And almost at once the lovely creature offered to make the supreme sacrifice, first beginning with an intimate conversation about poetry, then looking distressed and saying it was very hot in here and did he mind if she took off her dress, then taking it off, and everything else as well, until she stood there as God made her, then getting into bed and casting the mop of her flaming red hair about on the pillow, rolling her eyes in frenzied grief, and crying out in stricken tones: ""0 Algernon! Algernon! Algernon!""--which was the name of her departed husband.",1
4219,"0 Algernon! she cried, rolling about in grief and shaking her great mop of flaming hair--""Algie, darling, I am doing it for you! Algie, come back to me! Algie, I love you so! My pain is more than I can bear! Algernon!--No, no, poor boy! she cried, seizing George by the arm as he started to crawl out of bed, because, to tell the truth, he did not know whether she had gone mad or was playing some wicked joke on him. Don't go! she whispered tenderly, clinging to his arm. You just don't understand! I want to be so good to you--but everything I do or think or feel is Algernon, Algernon, Algernon!",1
4220,"She explained that her heart was buried in her husband's grave, that she was really ""a dead woman"" (she had already told him she was a great reader of psychologies), and that the act of love was just an act of devotion to dear old Algie, an effort to be with him again and to be ""a part of all this beauty. It was very fine and high and rare, and surely no one will think that George would sneer at a beautiful emotion, although it was too fine for him to understand. Therefore he went away, and never saw this lovely and sorrowful widow any more. He knew he was not fine enough. And yet, not for a moment should you think that he was ever bitter.",1
4221,"Finally, there was another girl who came into George Webber's life during this period of his brief glory, and her he understood. She was a beautiful and brave young woman, country-bred, and she had a good job, and a little apartment from which you could see the East River, the bridges, and all the busy traffic of the tugs and barges. She was not too rare and high for him, although she liked to take a part in serious conversations, to know worth-while people with liberal minds, and to keep up her interest in new schools and modern methods for the children. George became quite fond of her, and would stay all night and go away at daybreak when the streets were empty, and the great buildings went soaring up haggardly, incredibly, as if he were the first man to discover them, in the pale, pure, silent light of dawn.",1
4222,"He loved her well; and one night, after a long silence, she put her arms round him, drew him down beside her, and kissed him, whispering: Will you do something for me if I ask you to? Darling, anything!",1
4223,"he said. Anything you ask me, if I can! She held him pressed against her for a moment in the dark and living silence.",1
4224,"I want you to use your influence to get me into the Cosmopolis Club,"" she whispered passionately----  And then dawn came, and the stars fell. This was the last he saw of the great world of art, of fashion, and of letters. And if it seems to anyone a shameful thing that I have written thus of shameful things and shameful people, then I am sorry for it. My only object is to set down here the truthful record of George Webber's life, and he, I feel quite sure, would be the last person in the world to wish me to suppress any chapter of it. So I do not think that I have written shamefully.",1
4225,"The only shame George Webber felt was that at one time in his life, for however short a period, he broke bread and sat at the same table with any man when the living warmth of friendship was not there; or that he ever traded upon the toil of his brain and the blood of his heart to get the body of a scented whore that might have been better got in a brothel for some greasy coins. This was the only shame he felt. And this shame was so great in him that he wondered if all his life thereafter would be long enough to wash out of his brain and blood the last pollution of its loathsome taint.",1
4226,"And yet, he would not have it thought that he was bitter. 24. Man-Creating and Man-Alive It must be abundantly clear by now that George Webber was never bitter. What cause had he for bitterness? When he fled from the lion hunters he could always go back to the loneliness of his dismal two-room flat in Twelfth Street, and that is what he did. Also, he still had the letters from his friends in Libya Hill. They had not forgotten him. For four months and more after the publication of his hook they continued to write him, and all of them took pains to let him know exactly what place he held in their affections.",1
4227,"Throughout this time George heard regularly from Randy Shepperton. Randy was the only one that George had left to talk to, so George, in answering Randy, unburdened himself of everything he t bought and felt. Everything, that is, except upon a single topic--the rancour of his fellow-townsmen against the author who had exposed them naked to the world. Neither of the friends had ever mentioned it. Randy had set the pattern for evasion in his first letter, feeling that it was better to ignore the ugly gossip altogether and to let it die down and be forgotten. As for George, he had been too overwhelmed by it, too sunk and engulfed in it, to be able to speak of it at first. So they had chiefly confined themselves to the book itself, exchanging their thoughts and afterthoughts about it, with comments on what the various critics had said and left unsaid.",1
4228,"But by early March of the new year the flow of damning mail was past its flood and was thinning to a trickle, and one day Randy received from George the letter that he feared would have to come:  ""I have spent most of my time this past week,"" George wrote ""reading and re-reading all the letters that my erstwhile friends and neighbours have written me since the book came out. And now that the balloting is almost over and most of the vote is in, the result is startling and a little confusing. I have been variously compared to Judas Iscariot, Benedict Arnold, and Caesar's Brutus. I have been likened to the bird that fouls its own nest, to a viper that an innocent populace had long nurtured in its bosom, to a carrion crow preying upon the blood and bones of his relatives and friends, and to an unnatural ghoul to whom nothing is sacred, not even the tombs of the honoured dead. I have been called a vulture, a skunk, a hog, deliberately and lustfully wallowing in the mire, a defiler of pure womanhood, a rattlesnake, a jackass, an alley-cat, and a baboon. Although my imagination has been strained trying to conceive of a creature who combined in himself all of these interesting traits--it would be worth any novelist's time to meet such a chap!--there have been moments when I have felt that maybe my accusers are right...""  Behind this semblance of facetiousness, Randy could see that he was sincerely disturbed, and, knowing the capacity of George's soul for self-torture, he could pretty well imagine how deep and sore the extent of his full suffering might be.",1
4229,"He revealed it almost immediately:  ""Great God! What is it I have done? Sometimes I am overwhelmed by a sense of horrible and irrevocable guilt! Never before have I realised as I have this past week how terrible and great may be the distance between the Artist and the Man.",1
4230,"As the artist, I can survey my work with a clear conscience. I have the regrets and dissatisfactions that every writer ought to have: the book should have been better, it failed to measure up to what I wanted for it. But I am not ashamed of it. I feel that I wrote it as I did because of an inner necessity, that I had to do it, and that by doing it I was loyal to the only thing in me which is worth anything.",1
4231,"So speaks Man-Creating. Then, instantly, it all changes, and from Man-Creating I become simply Man-Alive--a member of society, a friend and neighbour, a son and brother of the human race. And when I look at what I have done from this point of view, suddenly I feel lower than a dog. I see all the pain and anguish I have caused to people that I know, and I wonder how I could have done it, and how there could possibly be any justification for it--yes, even if what I wrote had been as great as Lear, as eloquent as Hamlet.",1
4232,"Believe me--incredible as it may sound--when I tell you that during these weeks I have even derived a kind of grotesque and horrible pleasure from reading those letters which simply abused, cursed, or threatened me. There is, I found, a bitter relief in having someone curse me with every foul name he can think of or invent, or tell me he will put a bullet through my brain if I ever set foot in the streets of Libya Hill again. At any rate, I feel that the poor devil got some satisfaction out of writing it.",1
4233,"But the letters that drive the blade into my heart and twist it round are those which neither curse nor threaten--the letters written by stunned and stricken people who never did me any wrong, whose whole feeling towards me was one of kindly good will and belief, who did not know me as I am, and who write me now straight out of the suffering heart of man, with their spirits quivering, stripped, whipped by naked shame, to ask me over and over again in their bewilderment that terrible and insistent question: 'Why did you do it? Why? Why? Why?'  ""And as I read their letters I no longer know why.",1
4234,"I can't answer them. As Man-Creating, I thought I knew, and thought, too, that the answer was all-sufficient. I wrote about them with blunt directness, trying to put in every relevant detail and circumstance, and I did it because I thought it would be cowardly not to write that way, false to withhold or modify. I thought that the Thing Itself was its own and valid reason for being.",1
4235,"But now that it is done, I am no longer sure of anything. I am troubled by the most maddening doubts and impossible regrets. I have moments when I feel that I would give my life if I could un-write my book, un-print its pages. For what has it accomplished, apparently, except to ruin my relatives, my friends, and everyone in town whose life was ever linked with mine? And what is there for me to salvage out of all this wreckage?",1
4236,"'The integrity of the artist,' you may say. Ah, yes--if I could only soothe my conscience with that solacement! For what integrity is there that is not tainted with human frailty? If only I could tell myself that every word and phrase and incident in the book had been created at the top of my bent and with the impartial judgment of unrancorous detachment! But I know it is not true. So many words come back to me, so many whip-lash phrases, that must have been written in a spirit that had nothing to do with art or my integrity. We are such stuff as dust is made of, and where we fail--we fail! Is there, then, no such thing as a pure spirit in creation?",1
4237,"In all the whole wretched experience there is also a grim and horrible humour. It is insanely comical to find in almost all these letters that I am being cursed for doing things I did not do and for saying things I did not say. It is even more ludicrous to hear myself grudgingly praised for having the one thing that I have not got. Few of these letters--even those which threaten hanging, and those which deny me the remotest scrap of talent (except a genius for obscenity)--fail to commend me for what their writers call 'my memory'. Some of them accuse me of sneaking round as a little boy of eight with my pockets stuffed with notebooks, my ears fairly sprouting from my head and my eyes popping out, in my effort to spy upon and snatch up every word and act and phrase among my virtuous and unsuspecting fellow-townsmen.",1
4238,"'It's the dirtiest book I ever read,' one citizen cogently remarks, 'but I'll have to give you credit for one thing--you've got a wonderful memory. ' And that is just exactly what I have not got. I have to see a thing a thousand times before I see it once. This thing they call my memory, this thing they think they can themselves remember, is nothing that they ever saw. It is rather something that I saw after looking at the thing a thousand times, and this is what they think they can remember. Randy paused in his reading of the letter, for he suddenly realised that what George said was literally true.",1
4239,"In the weeks since the book was published, he himself had seen it proved over and over again. He knew that there was scarcely a detail in George's book that was precisely true to fact, that there was hardly a page in which everything had not been transmuted and transformed by the combining powers of George's imagination; yet readers got from it such an instant sense of reality that many of them were willing to swear that the thing described had been not only ""drawn from life"", but was the actual and recorded fact. And that was precisely what had made the outcry and denunciation so furious.",1
4240,"But not only that. It was funny enough to hear people talking and arguing with each other out of a savage conviction that scenes and incidents in the book were literally true because they may have had some basis in remembered fact. It was even more grotesque to hear them testify, as some of them now did, that they had been witnesses to events which he knew to be utter fabrications of the author's imagination.",1
4241,"Why,"" they cried, when final proof of anything was wanted, ""he's got it all in! He's written it all down, just the way it happened! Nothing's changed a bit! Look at the Square! They always came back to the Square, for the Square had occupied a prominent place in Home to Our Mountains.",1
4242,"George had pictured it with such intensity of vision that almost every brick and windowpane and cobblestone became imprinted on the reader's mind. But what was this Square? Was it the town Square of Libya Hill? Everybody said it was. Hadn't the local newspaper set it down in black and white that ""our native chronicler has described the Square with a photographic eye""? Then people had read the book for themselves and had agreed.",1
4243,"So it was useless to argue with them--useless to point out to them how Webber's Square differed from their own, unless to mention a hundred items of variation. They had been pitiful in their anger when t hey first discovered that art had imitated life; now they were ludicrous in their ignorance that life was also imitating art. With a smile and a shake of the head, Randy turned back to the letter:  ""In God's name, what have I done?",1
4244,"George concluded. Have I really acted according to some inner truth and real necessity, or did my unhappy mother conceive and give birth to a perverse monster who has defiled the dead and betrayed his family, kinsmen, neighbours, and the human race? What should I have done? What ought I to do now? If there is any help or answer in you, for Christ's sake let me have it. I feel like a dead leaf in a hurricane. I don't know where to turn. You alone can help me. Stay with me--write me--tell me what you think.",1
4245,"Yours ever,  ""GEORGE. George's suffering had been so palpable in every sentence of his letter that Randy had winced in reading it. He had felt the naked anguish of his friend's raw wound almost as if it had been his own. But he knew that neither he nor any other man could give the help answer that George sought. He would have to find it somehow in himself. That was the only way he had ever been able to learn anything.",1
4246,"So when Randy drafted his reply he deliberately made his letter as casual as he could. He did not want to let it seem that he attached too much importance to the town's reaction. He said that he did not know what he would do if he were George, since he was not a writer, but that he had always supposed a writer had to write about the life he knew. To cheer George up, he added that the people of Libya Hill reminded him of children who had not yet been told the facts of life. They still believed, apparently, in the stork. Only people who knew nothing about the world's literature could be surprised or shocked to learn where every good book came from.",1
4247,"And then, in a kind of mild parenthesis, he said that Tim Wagner, the town's most celebrated souse, noted for his wit in his rare intervals of sobriety, had been a warm supporter of the book from the beginning, but had made one reservation: ""Why, hell! If George wants to write about a horse-thief, that's all right. Only the next time I hope he don't give his street address. And there ain't no use in throwing in his telephone number, too. Randy knew this would amuse George, and it did.",1
4248,"In fact, George told him later that it was the most sound and valuable critical advice that he had ever had. Randy ended his letter by assuring George that even if he was a writer, he still considered him a member of the human race. And he added, in what he hoped would be a comforting postscript, that there were other angry mutterings abroad. He had heard a rumour, whispered by one of the town's leading business men with a great air of hush-hush and please-don't-breathe-a-word-of-this-to-anyone, that Mr. Jarvis Riggs, the president of Libya Hill's largest bank and past hero of infallibilities, was tottering on the brink of ruin.",1
4249,"So you see,"" Randy concluded, ""if that godly gentleman is capable of imperfection, there may still be hope of pardon even in creatures as vile as you. 25. The Catastrophe A day or two after receiving Randy's reply, George was reading the New York Times one morning when his eye was caught by a small news item on an inside page. It occupied only a scant two inches or so at the bottom of a column, but the Libya Hill date line leaped out at him:  BANK FAILS IN SOUTH  LIBYA HILL, 0. C., Mar. 12--The Citizens Trust Company of this city failed to open its doors for business this morning, and throughout the day, as news of its closing spread, conditions of near-panic mounted steadily here and in all the surrounding region.",1
4250,The bank was one of the largest in western Old Catawba and for years had been generally regarded as a model of conservative management and financial strength. The cause of its failure is not yet known. It is feared that the losses of the people of this community may be extensive.,1
4251,"The alarm occasioned by the closing of the bank was heightened later in the day by the discovery of the sudden and rather mysterious death of Mayor Baxter Kennedy. His body was found with a bullet through his head, and all the available evidence seems to point to suicide. Mayor Kennedy was a man of exceptionally genial and cheerful disposition, and is said to have had no enemies.",1
4252,"Whether there is any connection between the two events which have so profoundly disturbed the accustomed calm of this mountain district is not known, although their close coincidence has given rise to much excited conjecture. So,"" thought George, laying down the paper with a stunned and thoughtful air, ""it has come at last!... What was it that Judge Rumford Bland had said to them? The whole scene in the Pullman wash-room came back to him.",1
4253,"He saw again the stark and speechless terror in the faces of Libya Hill's leaders and rulers as the frail but terrible old blind man suddenly confronted them and held them with his sightless eyes and openly accused them of ruining the town. As George remembered this and sat there thinking about the news he had just read, he felt quite sure there must be some direct relation between the failure of the bank and the Mayor's suicide. There was, indeed. Things had been building up to this double climax for a long time.",1
4254,"Jarvis Riggs, the banker, had come from a poor but thoroughly respectable family in the town. When he was fifteen his father died and he had to quit school and go to work to support his mother. He held a succession of small jobs until, at eighteen, he was offered a modest but steady position in the Merchants National Bank.",1
4255,"He was a bright young fellow and a ""hustler"", and step by step he worked his way up until he became a teller. Mark Joyner kept a deposit at the Merchants National and used to come home and talk about Jarvis Riggs. In those days he had none of the brittle manner and pompous assurance that were to characterise him later, after he had risen to greatness. His hair, which was afterwards to turn a dead and lifeless sandy colour, had glints of gold in it then, his cheeks were full and rosy, he had a bright and smiling face, and it was always briskly and cheerfully--""Good morning, Mr. Joyner!"" or ""Good morning, Mr. Shepperton!""--when a customer came in. He was friendly, helpful, courteous, eager to please, and withal businesslike and knowing. He also dressed neatly and was known to be supporting his mother. All these things made people like him and respect him. They wanted to see him succeed. For Jarvis Riggs was a living vindication of an American legend--that of the poor boy who profits from the hardships of his early life and ""makes good"". People would nod knowingly to one another and say of him:  ""That young man has his feet on the ground.",1
4256,"Yes,"" they would say, ""he's going somewhere.  So when, along about 1912, the word began to go round that a small group of conservative business men were talking of starting a new bank, and that Jarvis Riggs was going to be its cashier, the feeling was most favourable. The backers explained that they were not going to compete with the established banks. It was simply their feeling that a growing town like Libya Hill, with its steady increase in population and in its business interests, could use another bank. And the new bank, one gathered, was to be conducted according to the most eminently approved principles of sound finance. But it was to be a progressive bank, too, forward-looking bank, mindful of the future, the great, golden, magnificent future that Libya Hill was sure to have--that it was even heresy to doubt. In this way it was also to be a young man's bank. And this was where Jarvis Riggs came in.",1
4257,"It is not too much to say that the greatest asset the new enterprise had from the beginning was Jarvis Riggs. He had played his cards well. He had offended no one, he had made no enemies, he had always remained modest, friendly, and yet impersonal, as if not wishing to intrude himself too much on the attention of men who stood for substance and authority in the town's life. The general opinion was that he knew what he was doing. He had learned about life in the highly-thought-of ""university of hard knocks"", he had learned business and banking in ""the hard school of experience"", so everybody felt that if Jarvis Riggs was going to be cashier of the new bank, then the new bank was pretty sure to be all right.",1
4258,"Jarvis himself went around town and sold stock in the bank. He had no difficulty at all. He made it quite plain that he did not think anyone was going to make a fortune. He simply sold the stock as a safe and sound investment, and that was how everybody felt about it. The bank was modestly capitalised at $25,000, and there were 250 shares at $100 each. The sponsors, including Jarvis, took 100 shares between them, and the remaining 150 shares were divided among ""a selected group of leading business men"". As Jarvis said, the bank was really ""a community project whose first and only purpose is to serve the community"", so no one was allowed to acquire too large an interest.",1
4259,"This was the way the Citizens Trust Company got started. And in no time at all, it seemed, Jarvis Riggs was advanced from cashier to vice-president, and then to president. The poor boy had come into his own.",1
4260,"In its early years the bank prospered modestly and conservatively. Its growth was steady but not spectacular. After the United States entered the war, it got its share of the nation's prosperity. But after the war, in 1921, there was a temporary lull, a period of ""adjustment"". Then the 1920's began in earnest.",1
4261,"The only way to explain what happened then is to say that there was ""a feeling in the air"". Everybody seemed to sense a prospect of quick and easy money. There was thrilling and rapid expansion in all directions, and it seemed that there were possibilities of wealth, luxury, and economic power hitherto undreamed of just lying around waiting for anyone who was bold enough to seize them.",1
4262,"Jarvis Riggs was no more insensible to these beckoning opportunities than the next man. The time had come, he decided, to step out and show the world what he could do. The Citizens Trust began to advertise itself as ""the fastest-growing bank in the state"". But it did not advertise what it was growing on.",1
4263,"That was the time when the political and business clique which dominated the destinies of the town, and which had put amiable Baxter Kennedy in the Mayor's office as its ""front"", began to focus its activities round the bank. The town was burgeoning rapidly and pushing out into the wilderness, people were confident of a golden future, no one gave a second thought to the reckless increase in public borrowing. Bond issues involving staggering sums were being constantly ""floated"" until the credit structure of the town was built up into a teetering inverted pyramid and the citizens of Libya Hill no longer owned the streets they walked on. The proceeds of these enormous borrowings were deposited with the bank. The bank, for its part, then returned these deposits to the politicians, or to their business friends, supporters, allies, and adherents--in the form of tremendous loans, made upon the most flimsy and tenuous security, for purposes of private and personal speculation. In this way ""The Ring"", as it was called, which had begun as an inner circle of a few ambitious men, became in time a vast and complex web that wove through the entire social structure of the town and involved the lives of thousands of people. And all of it now centred in the bank.",1
4264,"But the weaving of this complicated web of frenzied finance and speculation and special favours to ""The Ring"" could not go on for ever, though there were many who thought it could. There had to come a time when the internal strains and stresses became too great to sustain the load, a time when there would be ominous preliminary tremors to give warning of the crash that was to come. Just when this time arrived is pretty hard to say. One can observe a soldier moving forward in a battle and see him spin and tumble, and know the moment he is hit. But one cannot observe so exactly the moment when a man has been shot down by life.",1
4265,"So it was with the bank and with Jarvis Riggs. All that one can be sure of is that their moment came. And it came long before the mighty roar of tumbling stocks in Wall Street echoed throughout the nation. That event, which had its repercussions in Libya Hill as elsewhere, was not the prime cause of anything. What happened in Wall Street was only the initial explosion which in the course of the next few years was to set off a train of lesser explosions all over the land--explosions which at last revealed beyond all further doubting and denial the hidden pockets of lethal gases which a false, vicious, and putrescent scheme of things had released beneath the surface of American life.",1
4266,"Long before the explosion came that was to blow him sky-high, and the whole town with him, Jarvis Riggs had felt the tremors in the thing he had created, and he knew he was a doomed and ruined man. Before long others knew it, too, and knew that they were ruined with him. But they would not let themselves believe it. They did not dare. Instead, they sought to exorcise the thing they feared by pretending it wasn't there. Their speculations only grew madder, fiercer.",1
4267,"And then, somehow, the cheerful, easy-going Mayor found out what some of those round him must have known for months. That was in the spring of 1928, two years before the failure of the bank. At that time he went to Jarvis Riggs and told him what he knew, and then demanded to withdraw the city's funds. The banker looked the frightened Mayor in the eye and laughed at him.",1
4268,"What are you afraid of, Baxter?"" he said. Are you showing the white feather now that the pinch is on? You say you are going to withdraw the deposits of the city? All right--withdraw them. But I warn you, if you do the bank is ruined. It will have to close its doors to-morrow. And if it closes its doors, where is your town? Your precious town is also ruined. The Mayor looked at the banker with a white face and stricken eyes.",1
4269,"Jarvis Riggs leaned forward and his tones became more persuasive:  ""Pull out your money if you like, and wreck your town. But why not play along with us, Baxter? We're going to see this thing through. He was smiling now, and wearing his most winning manner. We're in a temporary depression--yes. But six months from now we'll be out of the woods. I know we will. We're coming back stronger than ever. You can't sell Libya Hill short,"" he said, using a phrase that was in great vogue just then. We've not begun to see the progress we're going to make. But the salvation and future of this town rests in your hands. So make up your mind about it. What are you going to do? The Mayor made up his mind.",1
4270,Unhappy man. Things drifted along. Time passed. The sands were running low.,1
4271,"By the autumn of 1929 there began to be a vague rumour going about that all was not well at the Citizens Trust. George Webber had heard it himself when he went home in September. But it was a nebulous thing, and as often as not the person who whispered it fearfully would catch himself and say:  ""Oh, pshaw!",1
4272,There's nothing in it. There couldn't be! You know how people talk.,1
4273,"But the rumour persisted through the winter, and by early March it had become a disturbing and sinister contagion. No one could say where it came from. It seemed to be distilled like a poison out of the mind and heart and spirit of the whole town.",1
4274,"On the surface there was nothing to account for it. The Citizens Trust maintained its usual appearance of solid substance, businesslike efficiency, and Greek-templed sanctity. Its broad plate-glass windows opening out upon the Square let in a flood of light, and the whole atmosphere was one of utter clarity. The very breadth of those windows seemed to proclaim to the world the complete openness and integrity of the bank's purpose. They seemed to say:  ""Here is the bank, and here are all the people in the bank, and all the people in the bank are openly at work.",1
4275,"Look, citizens, and see for yourselves. You see there is nothing hidden here. The bank is Libya, and Libya is the bank. It was all so open that one did not have to go inside to know what was going on.",1
4276,"One could stand on the pavement outside and look in and see everything. To the right were the tellers' cages, and to the left there was a railed-off space in which the officers sat at their sumptuous mahogany flat-topped desks. At the largest of these desks, just inside the low enclosure, sat Jarvis Riggs himself. There he sat, talking importantly and pompously, as though laying down the law, to one of his customers. There he sat, briskly reading through the pile of papers on his desk. There he sat, pausing in his work now and then to look up at the ceiling in deep thought, or to lean back in his swivel-chair and gently rock in meditation.",1
4277,"It was all just as it had always been. Then it happened. March 12, 1930 was a day that will be long remembered in the annals of Libya Hill. The double tragedy set the stage as nothing else could have done for the macabre weeks to follow.",1
4278,"If all the fire-bells in town had suddenly begun to ring out their alarm at nine o'clock that morning, the news could not have spread more rapidly that the Citizens Trust Company was closed. Word of it leapt from mouth to mouth. And almost instantly, from every direction, white-faced men and women came running towards the Square. There were housewives with their aprons on, their hands still dripping dishwater; workmen and mechanics with their warm tools in their hands; hatless business men and clerks; young mothers carrying babies in their arms. Everyone in town, it seemed, had dropped whatever he was doing and rushed out in the streets the moment the news had reached him.",1
4279,"The Square itself was soon a seething mass of frenzied people. Frantically, over and over, they asked each other the same questions: Was it really true? How had it happened? How bad was it?",1
4280,"In front of the bank itself the crowd was quieter, more stunned. To this spot, sooner or later, they all came, drawn by a common desperate hope that they would yet be able to see with their own eyes that it was not so. Like a sluggish current within that seething mass the queue moved slowly past, and as the people saw those locked and darkened doors they knew that all hope was gone. Some just stared with stricken faces, some of the women moaned and wailed, from the eyes of strong men silent tears coursed down, and from the mouths of others came the rumble of angry mutterings.",1
4281,"For their ruin had caught up with them. Many of the people in that throng had lost their life savings. But it was not only the bank's depositors who were ruined. Everyone now knew that their boom was over. They knew that the closing of the bank had frozen all their speculations just as they were, beyond the possibility of extricating themselves. Yesterday they could count their paper riches by ten thousands and by millions; to-day they owned nothing, their wealth had vanished, and they were left saddled with debts that they could never pay.",1
4282,"And they did not yet know that their city government was bankrupt, too--that six million dollars of public money had been lost behind those closed and silent doors. It was a little before noon on that ill-omened day that Mayor Kennedy was found dead. And, just to put the final touch of gruesome irony upon the whole event, a blind man found him.",1
4283,"Judge Rumford Bland testified at the inquest that he left his front office, upstairs in the ramshackle building that he owned there on the Square, and went out in the hall, heading in the direction of the toilet, where he proposed to perform an essential function of nature. It was dark out there, he said with his ghostly smile, and the floors creaked, but this didn't matter to him--he knew the way. He said he couldn't have lost his way even if he had wanted to. At the end of the hall he could hear a punctual drip of water, dropping with its slow, incessant monotone; and besides, there was the pervasive smell of the tin urinal--all he had to do was to follow his nose.",1
4284,"He arrived in darkness and pushed open the door, and suddenly his foot touched something. He leaned over, his white, thin fingers groped down, and all at once they were plunged--wet, warm, sticky reeking--into the foundering mass of what just five minutes before had been the face and brains of a living man. --No, he hadn't heard the shot--there was all that infernal commotion out in the Square.",1
4285,"--No, he had no idea how he had got there--walked it, he supposed--the City Hall was only twenty yards away. --No, he couldn't say why His Honour should have picked that spot to blow his brains out--there was no accounting for tastes--but if a man wanted to do it, that was probably as good a place as any. So it was that weak, easy-going, procrastinating, good-natured Baxter Kennedy, Mayor of Libya Hill, was found--all that was left of him--in darkness, by an evil old blind man.",1
4286,"In the days and weeks that followed the closing of the bank, Libya Hill presented a tragic spectacle the like of which had probably never before been seen in America. But it was a spectacle that was to be repeated over and over again, with local variations, in many another town and city within the next few years. The ruin of Libya Hill was much more than the ruin of the bank and the breakdown of the economic and financial order. True, when the bank failed, all that vast and complicated scheme of things which had been built upon it, the ramifications of which extended into every element of the community's life, toppled and crashed. But the closing of the bank was only like the action of a rip-cord which, once jerked, brought the whole thing down, and in doing so laid bare the deeper and more corrosive ruin within. And this deeper ruin--the essence of the catastrophe--was the ruin of the human conscience.",1
4287,"Here was a town of fifty thousand people who had so abdicated every principle of personal and communal rectitude, to say nothing of common sense and decency, that when the blow fell they had no inner resources with which to meet it. The town almost literally blew its brains out. Forty people shot themselves within ten days, and others did so later. And, as so often happens, many of those who destroyed themselves were among the least guilty of the lot. The rest--and this was the most shocking part of it--suddenly realising their devastating guilt to such a degree that they could not face the results of it, now turned like a pack of howling dogs to rend each other. Cries of vengeance rose up from all their throats, and they howled for the blood of Jarvis Riggs. But these cries proceeded not so much from a conviction of wounded justice and deceived innocence as from their opposites. It was the sublime, ironic, and irrevocable justice of what had happened to them, and their knowledge that they alone had been responsible for it, that maddened them. From this arose their sense of outrage and their cries of vengeance.",1
4288,"What happened in Libya Hill and elsewhere has been described in the learned tomes of the overnight economists as a breakdown of ""the system, the capitalist system"". Yes, it was that. But it was also much more than that. In Libya Hill it was the total disintegration of what, in so many different ways, the lives of all these people had come to be. It went much deeper than the mere obliteration of bank accounts, the extinction of paper profits, and the loss of property. It was the ruin of men who found out, as soon as these symbols of their outward success had been destroyed, that they had nothing left--no inner equivalent from which they might now draw new strength. It was the ruin of men who, discovering not only that their values were false but that they had never had any substance whatsoever, now saw at last the emptiness and hollowness of their lives. Therefore they killed themselves; and those who did not die by their own hands died by the knowledge that they were already dead.",1
4289,"How can one account for such a complete drying up of all the spiritual sources in the life of a people? When one observes a youth of eighteen on a city street and sees the calloused scar that has become his life, and remembers the same youth as he was ten years before when he was a child of eight, one knows what has happened though the cause be hidden. One knows that there came a time when life stopped growing for that youth and the scar began; and one feels that if he could only find the reason and the cure, he would know what revolutions are.",1
4290,"In Libya Hill there must have been a time when life stopped growing and the scar began. But the learned economists of ""the system"" do not bother about this. For them, it belongs to the realm of the metaphysical--they are impatient of it, they will not trouble with it, they want to confine the truth within their little picket fence of facts. But they cannot. It is not enough to talk about the subtle complications of the credit structure, the intrigues of politics and business, the floating of bond issues, the dangers of inflation, speculation, and unsound prices, or the rise and decline of banks. When all these facts are added up, they still don't give the answer. For there is something more to say.",1
4291,"So with Libya Hill:  One does not know at just what moment it began, but one suspects that it began at some time long past in the lone, still watches of the night, when all the people lay waiting in their beds in darkness. Waiting for what? They did not know. They only hoped that it would happen--some thrilling and impossible fulfilment, some glorious enrichment and release of their pent lives, some ultimate escape from their own tedium.",1
4292,"But it did not come. Meanwhile, the stiff boughs creaked in the cold bleakness of the corner lights, and the whole town waited, imprisoned in its tedium. And sometimes, in furtive hallways, doors opened and closed, there was a padding of swift, naked feet, the stealthy rattling of brass casters, and behind old battered shades, upon the edge of Nigger-town, the dull and fetid quickenings of lust.",1
4293,"Sometimes, in grimy stews of night's asylumage, an oath, a blow, a fight. Sometimes, through the still air, a shot, the letting of nocturnal blood. And always, through broken winds, the sounds of shifting engines in the station yards, far off, along the river's edge--and suddenly the thunder of great wheels, the tolling of the bell, the loneliness of the whistle cry wailed back, receding towards the North, and towards the hope, the promise, and the memory of the world unfound.",1
4294,"Meanwhile, the boughs creaked bleakly in stiff light, ten thousand men were waiting in the darkness, far off a dog howled, and the Court-House bell struck three. No answer? Impossible?...Then let those--if such there be--who have not waited in the darkness, find answers of their own.",1
4295,"But if speech could frame what spirit utters, if tongue could tell what the lone heart knows, there would be answers somewhat other than those which are shaped by the lean pickets of rusty facts. There would be answers of men waiting, who have not spoken yet. Below the starred immensity of mountain night old Rumford Bland, he that is called ""The Judge"", strokes his sunken jaws reflectively as he stands at the darkened window of his front office and looks out with sightless eyes upon the ruined town. It is cool and sweet to-night, the myriad promises of life are lyric in the air. Gem-strewn in viewless linkage on the hills the lights make a bracelet for the town. The blind man knows that they are there, although he cannot see them. He strokes his sunken jaws reflectively and smiles his ghostly smile.",1
4296,"It is so cool and sweet to-night, and spring has come. There never was a year like this, they say, for dogwood in the hills. There are so many thrilling, secret things upon the air to-night--a burst of laughter, and young voices, faint, half-broken, and the music of a dance--how could one know that when the blind man smiles and stroke's his sunken jaws reflectively, he is looking out upon a ruined town?",1
4297,"The new Court-House and City Hall are very splendid in the dark to-night. But he has never seen them--they were built since he went blind. Their fronts are bathed, so people say, in steady, secret light just like the nation's dome at Washington. The blind man strokes his sunken jaws reflectively. Well, they should be splendid--they cost enough.",1
4298,"Beneath the starred immensity of mountain night there is something stirring in the air, a rustling of young leaves. And round the grass roots there is something stirring in the earth to-night. And below the grass roots and the sod, below the dew-wet pollen of young flowers, there is something alive and stirring. The blind man strokes his sunken jaws reflectively. Aye, there below, where the eternal worm keeps vigil, there is something stirring in the earth. Down, down below, where the worm incessant through the ruined house makes stir.",1
4299,"What lies there stir-less in the earth to-night, down where the worm keeps vigil? The blind man smiles his ghostly smile. In his eternal vigil the worm stirs, but many men are rotting in their graves to-night, and sixty-four have bullet fractures in their skulls. Ten thousand more are lying in their beds to-night, living as shells live. They, too, are dead, though yet unburied. They have been dead so long they can't remember how it was to live. And many weary nights must pass before they can join the buried dead, down where the worm keeps vigil.",1
4300,"Meanwhile, the everlasting worm keeps vigil, and the blind man strokes his sunken jaws, and slowly now he shifts his sightless gaze and turns his back upon the ruined town. 26. The Wounded Faun Ten days after the failure of the bank in Libya Hill, Randy Shepperton arrived in New York. He had made up his mind suddenly, without letting George know, and the motives that brought him were mixed. For one thing, he wanted to talk to George and see if he couldn't help to get him straightened out. His letters had been so desperate that Randy was beginning to be worried about him. Then, too, Randy felt he just had to get away from Libya Hill for a few days and out of that atmosphere of doom and ruin and death. And he was free now, there was nothing to keep him from coming, so he came.",1
4301,"He arrived early in the morning, a little after eight o'clock, and took a taxi from the station to the address on Twelfth Street and rang the bell. After a long interval and another ringing of the bell, the door lock clicked and he entered the dim-lit hall. The stairs were dark and the whole house seemed sunk in sleep. His footfalls rang out upon the silence. The air had a close, dead smell compounded of many elements, among which he could distinguish the dusty emanations of old wood and worn plankings and the ghostly reminders of many meals long since eaten. The light was out on the second-floor landing and the gloom was Stygian, so he groped along the wall until he found the door and rapped loudly with his knuckles.",1
4302,"In a moment the door was almost jerked off its hinges, and George, his hair dishevelled, his eyes red with sleep, an old bathrobe flung hastily over his pyjamas, stood framed in the opening, blinking out into the darkness. Randy was a little taken back by the change in his appearance in the six months since he had last seen him. His face, which had always had a youthful and even childish quality, had grown older and sterner. The lines had deepened. And now his heavy lip stuck out at his caller with a menacing challenge, and his whole pug-nosed countenance had a bulldog look of grim truculence.",1
4303,"When Randy recovered from his first surprise he cried out heartily:  ""Now wait a minute! Wait a minute! Don't shoot! I'm not that fellow at all!",1
4304,"At the unexpected sound of the familiar voice George looked startled, then his face broke into a broad smile of incredulity and delight. Well, I'll be damned! he cried, and with that he seized hold of Randy, wrung him vigorously by the hand, almost dragged him into the room, and then held him off at arm's length while he grinned his pleasure and amazement.",1
4305,"That's better,"" said Randy in a tone of mock relief. I was afraid it might be permanent. They now clapped each other on the back and exchanged those boisterous and half-insulting epithets with which two men who have been old friends like to greet each other when they meet.",1
4306,"Then, almost at once, George asked Randy eagerly about the bank. Randy told him. George listened intently to the shocking details of the catastrophe. It was even worse than he had supposed, and he kept firing questions at Randy. At last Randy said:  ""Well, that's just about the whole story.",1
4307,"I've told you all I know. But come, we can talk about that later. What I want to know is--how the hell are you? You're not cracking up, too, are you? Your last letters made me a little uneasy about you. In their joy at seeing one another again and their eagerness to talk, they had both remained standing by the door.",1
4308,"But now, as Randy put his casual finger on George's sore spot, George winced and began to pace back and forth in an agitated way without answering. Randy saw that he looked tired. His eyes were bloodshot, as if he had not slept well, and his unshaved face made him look haggard. The old bathrobe he was wearing had all the buttons missing, and the corded rope that belonged to it was also gone and George had lashed a frayed necktie round the middle to hold the thing together. This remarkable garment added to his general appearance of weariness and exhaustion. His features as he strode about the room had the contracted intensity of nervous strain, and as he looked up quickly Randy saw the worry and apprehension in his eyes.",1
4309,"Suddenly he paused and faced Randy squarely, and with a grim set to his jaws said:  ""All right, let me have it! What are they saying now?""  ""Who? What is who saying?""  ""The people back home.",1
4310,"That's what you meant, isn't it? From what they've written me and said to my face, I can imagine what they're saying behind my back. Let's have it and get it over with. What are they saying now?""  ""Why,"" said Randy, ""I don't know that they're saying anything.",1
4311,"Oh, they said plenty at first--just the kind of thing they wrote you. But since the bank failed I don't think I've heard your name mentioned. They've got too much real trouble to worry about now. George looked incredulous, and then relieved.",1
4312,"For a moment he studied the floor and said nothing. But as his sense of relief spread its soothing balm upon his agitated spirit he looked up and smiled broadly at his friend, and then, realising for the first time that Randy was standing there with his back against the door, he suddenly remembered his duties as a host and burst out impulsively and warmly:  ""God, Randy, I'm glad to see you! I can't get over it! Sit down. Sit down! Can't you find a chair somewhere? For Christ's sake, where are all the chairs in this dump?""  With that he went over to a chair that was piled high with manuscript and books, brushed these things off unceremoniously on to the floor, and shoved the chair across the room towards his friend.",1
4313,"He apologised now for the coldness of the place, explaining unnecessarily that the door-bell had got him out of bed, and telling Randy to keep his overcoat on and that it would be warmer in a little while. Then he vanished through a doorway into a noisome cubby-hole, turned on a faucet, and came back with a coffee-pot full of water. This he proceeded to pour into the spout of the radiator that stood below a window. When this was done, he got down on his hands and knees, peered about underneath, struck a match, turned some sort of valve, and applied the flame. There was an immediate blast, and pretty soon the water began to rattle and gurgle in the pipes.",1
4314,"It's gas,"" he said, as he clambered to his feet. That's the worst thing about this place--it gives me headaches when I have to spend long hours working here. While this operation had been going on, Randy took a look round.",1
4315,"The room, which was really two large rooms thrown together when the sliding-doors that joined them were pushed into the wall, as now, seemed as big as a barn. The windows at the front gave on to the street, and those at the rear looked out over some bleak little squares of backyard fences to another row of buildings. The first impression Randy got was one of staleness: the whole apartment had that unmistakable look and feeling of a place where someone has lived and where something has been finished so utterly that there is no going back to it. It was not merely the disorder everywhere--the books strewn around, the immense piles of manuscript, the haphazard scattering of stray socks, shirts and collars, old shoes, and unpressed trousers inside out. It was not even the dirty cup and saucer filled with old cigarette-butts, all of them stained with rancid coffee, which was set down in the vast and untidy litter of the table. It was just that life had gone out of all these things--they were finished--all as cold and tired and stale as the old dirty cup and the exhausted butts.",1
4316,"George was living in the midst of this dreary waste with a kind of exasperated and unhappy transciency. Randy saw that he had caught him on the wing, in that limbo of waiting between work which is one of the most tormenting periods a writer can know. He was through with one thing, and yet not really ready to settle down in earnest to another. He was in a state of furious but exhausted ferment. But it was not merely that he was going through a period of gestation before going on with his next book. Randy realised that the reception of his first, the savagery of the attack against him in Libya Hill, the knowledge that he had done something more than write a book--that he had also torn up violently by the roots all those ties of friendship and sentiment that bind a man to home--all of this, Randy felt, had so bewildered and overwhelmed him that now he was caught up in the maelstrom of the conflict which he had himself produced. He was not ready to do another piece of work because his energies were still being absorbed and used up by the repercussions of the first.",1
4317,"Moreover, as Randy looked round the room and his eye took in the various objects that contributed to its incredible chaos, he saw, in a dusty corner, a small green smock or apron, wrinkled as though it had been thrown aside with a gesture of weary finality, and beside it, half-folded inwards, a single small and rather muddy overshoe. The layer of dust upon them showed that they had lain there for months. These were the only poignant ghosts, and Randy knew that something which had been there in that room had gone out of it for ever--that George was done with it.",1
4318,"Randy saw how it was with George, and felt that almost any decisive act would be good for him. So now he said:  ""For God's sake, George, why don't you pack up and clear out of all this? You're through with it--it's finished--it'll only take you a day or two to wind the whole thing up. So pull yourself together and get out. Move away somewhere--anywhere--just to enjoy the luxury of waking up in the morning and finding none of this round you. I know,"" said George, going over to a sagging couch and tossing back the pile of foul-looking bedclothes that covered it and flinging himself down wearily.",1
4319,"I've thought of it,"" he said. Randy did not press the point. He knew it would be no use. George would have to work round to it in his own way and in his own good time.",1
4320,"George shaved and dressed, and they went out for breakfast. Then they returned and talked all morning, and were finally interrupted by the ringing of the telephone. George answered it. Randy could tell by the sounds which came from the transmitter that the caller was female, garrulous, and unmistakably Southern. George did nothing for a while but blurt out polite banalities:  ""Well now, that's fine...",1
4321,"I certainly do appreciate it... That's mighty nice of you... Well now, I'm certainly glad you called. I hope you will remember me to all of them. Then he was silent, listening intently, and Randy gathered from the contraction of his face that the conversation had now reached another stage. In a moment he said slowly, in a somewhat puzzled tone: ""Oh, he is?... He did?... Well""--somewhat indefinitely--""that's mighty nice of him ... Yes, I'll remember...Thank you very much...Good-bye.",1
4322,"He hung up the receiver and grinned wearily. That,"" he said, ""was one of the I-just-called-you-up-to-tell-you-that- I've-read-it-all-every-word-of-it-and-I-think-it's-perfectly-grand people--another lady from the South. As he went on his voice unconsciously dropped into burlesque as he tried to imitate the unction of a certain type of Southern female whose words drip molasses mixed with venom:  ""'Why, I'll declayah, we're all just so proud of yew-w!",1
4323,"I'm just simply thrilled to daith! It's the most wondaful thing I evah read! Why it is! Why, I nevah dreamed that anyone could have such a wondaful command of lang-widge!'""  ""But don't you like it just a little?"" asked Randy.",1
4324,"Even if it's laid on with a trowel, you must get some satisfaction from it. God! George said wearily, and came back and fell upon the couch. If you only knew! That's only one out of a thousand! That telephone there""--he jerked a thumb towards it--""has played a tune for months now! I know them all--I've got 'em classified! I can tell by the tone of the voice the moment they speak whether it's going to be type B or group X.""  ""So the author is already growing jaded?",1
4325,"He's already bored with his first taste of fame? Fame?""--disgustedly. That's not fame--that's just plain damn rag-picking!""  ""Then you don't think the woman was sincere?""  ""Yes""--his face and tone were bitter now--""she had all the sincerity of a carrion crow.",1
4326,"She'll go back and tell them that she talked to me, and by the time she's finished with me she'll have a story that every old hag in town can lick her chops and cackle over for the next six months. It sounded so unreasonable and unjust that Randy spoke up quickly:  ""Don't you think you're being unfair? George's head was down dejectedly and he did not even look up; with his hands plunged in his trouser pockets he just snorted something unintelligible but scornful beneath his breath.",1
4327,"It annoyed and disappointed Randy to see him acting so much like a spoiled brat, so he said:  ""Look here! It's about time you grew up and learned some sense It seems to me you're being pretty arrogant. Do you think you can afford to be? I doubt if you or any man can go through life successfully playing the spoiled genius. Again he muttered something in a sullen tone.",1
4328,"Maybe that woman was a fool,"" Randy went on. Well, a lot of people are. And maybe she hasn't got sense enough to understand what you wrote in the way you think it should be understood. But what of it? She gave the best she had. It seems to me that instead of sneering at her now, you could be grateful. George raised his head: ""You heard the conversation, then?""  ""No, only what you told me.",1
4329,"All right, then--you didn't get the whole story. I wouldn't mind if she'd just called up to gush about the book, but, look here!""--he leaned towards Randy very earnestly and tapped him on the knee. I don't want you to get the idea that I'm just a conceited fool. I've lived through and found out about something these last few months that most people never have the chance to know. I give you my solemn word for it, that woman didn't call up because she liked my book and wanted to tell me so. She called up,"" he cried bitterly, ""to pry round, and to find out what she could about me, and to pick my bones. Oh, look here now--"" Randy began impatiently.",1
4330,"Yes, she did, too! I know what I'm talking about! he said earnestly. Here's what you didn't hear--here's what she was working round to all the time--it came out at the end. I don't know who she is, I never heard of her before--but she's a friend of Ted Reeve's wife. And apparently he thinks I put him in the book, and has been making threats that he's going to kill me if I ever go back home. This was true; Randy had heard it in Libya Hill.",1
4331,"That's what it was about,"" George sneered bitterly--""that woman's call. That's what most of the calls are about. They want to talk to the Beast of the Apocalypse, feel him out, and tell him: 'Ted's all right! Now don't you believe all those things, you hear! He was upset at first--but he sees the whole thing now, the way you meant it--and everything's all right.' That's what she said to me, so maybe I'm not the fool you think I am!",1
4332,"He was so earnest and excited that for a moment Randy did not answer him. Besides, making allowances for the distortion of his feelings, he could see some justice in what George said. Have you had many calls like that? Randy asked.",1
4333,"Oh""--wearily--""almost every day. I think everyone who has been up here from home since the book was published has telephoned me. They go about it in different ways. There are those who call me up as if I were some kind of ghoul: 'How are you?'--in a small, quiet tone such as you might use to a condemned man just before they lead him to the death chamber at Sing Sing--'Are you all right?' And then you get alarmed, you begin to stammer and to stumble round, 'Why, yes? Yes, I'm fine! Fine, thanks!'--meanwhile, beginning to feel yourself all over just to see if you're all there. And then they say in that same still voice: 'Well, I just wanted to know...I just called up to find out... I hope you're all right.' After looking at Randy for a moment in a tormented and bewildered way, he burst out in an exasperated laugh:  ""It's been enough to give a hippopotamus the creeps!",1
4334,"To listen to them talk, you'd think I was Jack the Ripper! Even those who call up to laugh and joke about it take the attitude that the only reason I wrote the book was to see how much dirt and filth I could dig up on people I didn't like. Yes! he cried bitterly. My greatest supporters at home seem to be the disappointed little soda-jerkers who never made a go of it and the frustrated hangers-on who never got into the Country Club. 'You sure did give it to that son-of-a-bitch, Jim So-and-so!' they call me up to tell me. 'You sure did burn him up! I had to laugh when I read what you said about him--boy!' Or: 'Why didn't you say something about that bastard, Charlie What's-his-name? I'd have given anything to see you take him for a ride!'...Jesus God! He struck his fist upon his knee with furious exasperation. That's all it means to them: nothing but nasty gossip, slander, malice, envy, a chance of getting back at someone--you'd think that none of them had ever read a book before. Tell me,"" he said earnestly, bending towards Randy, ""isn't there anyone there--anyone besides yourself--who gives a damn about the book itself? Isn't there anyone who has read it as a book, who sees what it was about, who understands what I was trying to do?""  His eyes were full of torment now.",1
4335,"It was out at last--the thing Randy had dreaded and wanted to avoid. He said:  ""I should think you'd know more about that by this time than anyone. After all, you've had more opportunity than anyone else to find out.",1
4336,"Well, that was out, too. It was the answer that he had to have, that he had feared to get. He stared at Randy for a minute or two with his tormented eyes, then he laughed bitterly and began to rave:  ""Well, then, to hell with it!",1
4337,To hell with all of it! He began to curse violently. The small two-timing bunch of crooked sons-ofbitches! They can go straight to hell! They've done their best to ruin me!,1
4338,"It was ignoble and unworthy and untrue. Randy saw that he was lashing himself into a fit of violent recrimination in which all that was worst and weakest m him was coming out--distortion, prejudice, and self-pity. These were the things he would have to conquer somehow or belost. Randy stopped him curtly:  ""Now, no more of that!",1
4339,"For God's sake, George, pull yourself together! If a lot of damn fools read your book and didn't understand it, that's not Libya Hill, that's the whole world. People there are no different from people anywhere. They thought you wrote about them--and the truth is, you did. So they got mad at you. You hurt their feelings, and you touched their pride. And, to be blunt about it, you opened up a lot of old wounds. There were places where you rubbed salt in. In saying this, I'm not like those others you complain about: you know damn wel! I understand what you did and why you had to do it. But just the same, there were some things that you did not have to do--and you'd have had a better book if you hadn't done them. So don't whine about it now. And don't think you're a martyr.",1
4340,"But he had got himself primed into a mood of martyrdom. As Randy looked at him sitting there, one hand gripping his knee, his face sullen, his head brooding down between his hulking shoulders, he could see how this mood had grown upon him. To begin with, he had been naive not to realise how people would feel about some of the things he had written. Then, when the first accusing letters came, he had been overwhelmed and filled with shame and humility and guilt over the pain he had caused. But as time went on and the accusations became more vicious and envenomed, he had wanted to strike back and defend himself. When he saw there was no way to do that--when people answered his explanatory letters only with new threats and insults--he had grown bitter. And finally, after taking it all so hard and torturing himself through the whole gamut of emotions, he had sunk into this morass of self-pity.",1
4341,"George began to talk now about ""the artist"", spouting all the intellectual and aesthetic small change of the period. The artist, it seemed, was a kind of fabulous, rare, and special creature who lived on ""beauty"" and ""truth"" and had thoughts so subtle that the average man could comprehend them no more than a mongrel could understand the moon he bayed at. The artist, therefore, could achieve his ""art"" only through a constant state of flight into some magic wood, some province of enchantment.",1
4342,"The phrases were so spurious that Randy felt like shaking him. And what annoyed him most was the knowledge that George was really so much better than this. He must know how cheap and false what he was saying really was. At last Randy said to him quietly:  ""George, of all the people I have ever known, you are the least qualified to play the wounded faun.",1
4343,"But he was so immersed in his fantasy that he paid no attention. He just said: ""Huh?""--and then was off again. Anybody who was ""a real artist,"" he said, was doomed to be an outcast from society. His inevitable fate was to be ""driven out by the tribe. It was all so wrong that Randy lost patience with him:  ""For Christ's sake, George, what's the matter with you?",1
4344,"You're talking like a fool! he said. You haven't been driven out of anywhere! You've only got yourself in a little hot water at home! Here you've been ranting your head off about 'beauty' and 'truth'! God! Why in hell, then, don't you stop lying to yourself? Can't you see? The truth is that for the first time in your life you've managed to get a foothold in the thing you want to do. Your book got some good notices and has had a fair sale. You're in the right spot now to go on. So where have you been driven? No doubt all those threatening letters have made you feel like an exile from home, but hell, man!--you've been an exile for years. And of your own accord, too! You know you've had no intention of ever going back there to live. But just as soon as they started yelling for your scalp, you fooled yourself into believing you'd been driven out by force! And, as for this idea of yours that a man achieves 'beauty' by escaping somewhere from the life he knows, isn't the truth just the opposite? Haven't you written me the same thing yourself a dozen times? How do you mean?",1
4345,"he said sullenly. I mean, taking your own book as an example, isn't it true that every good thing in it came, not because you withdrew from life, but because you got into it--because you managed to understand and use the life you knew? He was silent now.",1
4346,"His face, which had been screwed up into a morose scowl, gradually began to relax and soften, and at last he looked up with a little crooked smile. I don't know what comes over me sometimes,"" he said. He shook his head and looked ashamed of himself and laughed. You're right, of course,"" he went on seriously. What you say is true. And that's the way it has to be, too. A man must use what he knows--he can't use what he doesn't know... And that's why some of the critics make me mad,"" he added bluntly.",1
4347,"How's that?"" asked Randy, glad to hear him talking sense at last. Oh, you know,"" he said, ""you've seen the reviews. Some of them said the book was 'too autobiographical'. This was surprising.",1
4348,"And Randy, with the outraged howls of Libya Hill still ringing in his ears, and with George's outlandish rantings in answer to those howls still echoing in the room, could hardly believe he had heard him aright. He could only say in frank astonishment: Well, it was autobiographical--you can't deny it. But not 'too autobiographical',"" George went on earnestly.",1
4349,"If the critics had just crossed those words out and written in their place 'not autobiographical enough', they'd have hit it squarely. That's where I failed. That's where the real fault was. There was no question that he meant it, for his face was twisted suddenly with a grimace, the scar of his defeat and shame. My young hero was a stick, a fool, a prig, a snob, as Dedalus was--as in my own presentment of the book I was. There was the weakness. Oh, I know--there were lots of autobiographical spots in the book, and where it was true I'm not ashamed of it, but the hitching-post I tied the horses to wasn't good enough. It wasn't true autobiography. I've learned that now, and learned why. The failure comes from the false personal. There's the guilt. That's where the young genius business gets in--the young artist business, what you called a while ago the wounded faun business. It gets in and it twists the vision. The vision may be shrewd, subtle, piercing, within a thousand special frames accurate and Joycean--but within the larger one, false, mannered, and untrue. And the large one is the one that matters. He meant it now, and he was down to solid rock.",1
4350,"Randy saw the measure of his suffering. And yet, now as before, he seemed to be going to extremes and taking it too hard. In some such measure all men fail, and Randy said:  ""But was anything ever as good as it could be?",1
4351,"Who succeeded anyway? Oh, plenty did! he said impatiently. Tolstoy when he wrote War and Peace. Shakespeare when he wrote King Lear. Mark Twain in the first part of Life on the Mississippi. Of course they're not as good as they might have been--nothing ever is. Only, they missed in the right way: they might have put the shot a little further--but they were not hamstrung by their vanity, shackled by their damned self-consciousness. That's what makes for failure. That's where I failed. Then what's the remedy?""  ""To use myself to the top of my bent.",1
4352,"To use everything I have. To milk the udder dry, squeeze out the last drop, until there is nothing left. And if I use myself as a character, to withhold nothing, to try to see and paint myself as I am--the bad along with the good, the shoddy alongside of the true--just as I must try to see and draw every other character. No more false personal, no more false pride, no more pettiness and injured feelings. In short, to kill the wounded faun. Randy nodded: ""Yes.",1
4353,"And what now? What comes next? I don't know,"" he answered frankly.",1
4354,"His eyes showed his perplexity. That's the thing that's got me stumped. It's not that I don't know what to write about.--God! he laughed suddenly. You hear about these fellows who write one book and then can't do another because they haven't got anything else to write about!""  ""You're not worried about that?""  ""Lord, no!",1
4355,"My trouble's all the other way round! I've got too much material. It keeps backing up on me""--he gestured round him at the tottering piles of manuscript that were everywhere about the room--""until sometimes I wonder what in the name of God I'm going to do with it all--how I'm going to find a frame for it, a pattern, a channel, a way to make it flow! He brought his fist down sharply on his knee and there was a note of desperation in his voice. Sometimes it actually occurs to me that a man may be able to write no more because he gets drowned in his own secretions!""  ""So you're not afraid of ever running dry?""  He laughed loudly.",1
4356,"At times I almost hope I will,"" he said. There'd be a kind of comfort in the thought that some day--maybe after I'm forty--I would dry up and become like a camel, living on my hump. Of course, I don't really mean that either. It's not good to dry up--it's a form of death... No, that's not what bothers me. The thing I've got to find out is the way! He was silent a moment, staring at Randy, then he struck his fist upon his knee again and cried: ""The way! The way! Do you understand?""  ""Yes,"" said Randy, ""I think I do.",1
4357,"But how?""  George's face was full of perplexity.. He was silent, trying to phrase his problem. I'm looking for a way,"" he said at last. I think it may be something like what people vaguely mean when they speak of fiction. A kind of legend, perhaps. Something--a story--composed of all the knowledge I have, of all the living I've seen. Not the facts, you understand--not just the record of my life--but something truer than the facts--something distilled out of my experience and transmitted into a form of universal application. That's what the best fiction is, isn't it?""  Randy smiled and nodded encouragement.",1
4358,"George was all right. He needn't have worried about him. He would work his way out of the morass. So Randy said cheerfully:  ""Have you started the new book yet?""  He began to talk rapidly, and again Randy saw worried tension in his eyes.",1
4359,"Yes,"" he said, ""I've written a whole lot. These ledgers here""--he indicated a great stack of battered ledgers on the table--""and all this manuscript""--he swept his arms in a wide gesture round the room--""they are full of new writing. I must have written half a million words or more. Randy then made the blunder which laymen so often innocently make when they talk to writers.",1
4360,"What's it about?"" he said. He was rewarded with an evil scowl. George did not answer. He began to pace up and down, thinking to himself with smouldering intensity. At last he stopped by the table, turned and faced Randy, and, with the redemptive honesty that was the best thing in him, bluntly said:  ""No, I haven't started my new book yet!...Thousands of words""--he whacked the battered ledgers with a flattened palm--""hundreds of ideas, dozens of scenes, of scraps, of fragments--but no book!...And""--the worried lines about his eyes now deepened--""time goes by!",1
4361,"It has been almost five months since the other book was published, and now""--he threw his arms out towards the huge stale chaos of that room with a gesture of exasperated fury--""here I am! Time gets away from me before I know that it has gone! Time! he cried, and smote his fist into his palm and stared before him with a blazing and abstracted eye as though he saw a ghost--""Time!",1
4362,His enemy was Time. Or perhaps it was his friend. One never knows for sure.,1
4363,"Randy stayed in New York several days, and the two friends talked from morning till night and from night till morning. Everything that came into their heads they talked about. George would stride back and forth across the floor in his restless way, talking or listening to Randy, and suddenly would pause beside the table, scowl, look round him as though he were seeing the room for the first time, bring down his hand with a loud whack on a pile of manuscript, and boom out:",1
4364,"Do you know what the reason is for all these words I've written? Well, I'll tell you. It's because I'm so damned lazy!""  ""It doesn't look like the room of a lazy man to me,"" said Randy, laughing.",1
4365,"It is though,"" George answered. That's why it looks this way. You know""--his face grew thoughtful as he spoke--""I've got an idea that a lot of the work in this world gets done by lazy people. That's the reason they work--because they're so lazy. I don't follow you,"" said Randy, ""but go on--spill it--get it off your chest.",1
4366,"Well,"" he said, quite seriously, ""it's this way: you work because you're afraid not to. You work because you have to drive yourself to such a fury to begin. That part's just plain hell 1 It's so hard to get started that once you do you're afraid of slipping back. You'd rather do anything than go through all that agony again--so you keep going--you keep going faster all the time--you keep going till you couldn't stop even if you wanted to. You forget to eat, to shave, to put on a clean shirt when you have one. You almost forget to sleep, and when you do try to you can't--because the avalanche has started, and it keeps going night and day. And people say: 'Why don't you stop some time? Why don't you forget about it now and then? Why don't you take a few days off?' And you don't do it because you can't--you can't stop yourself--and even if you could you'd be afraid to because there'd be all that hell to go through getting started up again. Then people say you're a glutton for work, but it isn't so. It's laziness--just plain, damned, simple laziness, that's all. Randy laughed again.",1
4367,"He had to--it was so much like George--no one else could have come out with a thing like that. And what made it so funny was that he knew George saw the humour of it, too, and yet was desperately in earnest. He could imagine the weeks and months of solemn cogitation that had brought George to this paradoxical conclusion, and now, like a whale after a long plunge, he was coming up to spout and breathe.",1
4368,"Well, I see your point,"" Randy said. Maybe you're right. But at least it's a unique way of being lazy. No,"" George answered, ""I think it's probably a very natural one.",1
4369,"Now take all those fellows that you read about,"" he went on excitedly --""Napoleon--and--and Balzac--and Thomas Edison""--he burst out triumphantly--""these fellows who never sleep more than an hour or two at a time, and can keep going night and day--why, that's not because they love to work! It's because they're really lazy--and afraid not to work because they know they're lazy! Why, hell yes! he went on enthusiastically. I know that's the way it's been with all those fellows! Old Edison now,"" he said scornfully, ""going round pretending to people that he works all the time because he likes it!""  ""You don't believe that?",1
4370,"Hell, no!""--scornfully. I'll bet you anything you like that if you could really find out what's going on in old Edison's mind, you'd find that he wished he could stay in bed every day until two o'clock in the afternoon! And then get up and scratch himself! And then lie around in the sun for a while! And hang round with the boys down at the village store, talking about politics, arid who's going to win the World Series next autumn! Then what keeps him from it, if that's what he wants to do?""  ""Why,"" he cried impatiently, ""laziness!",1
4371,"That's all. He's afraid to do it because he knows he's so damned lazy! And he's ashamed of being lazy, and afraid he'll get found out! That's why!""  ""Ah, but that's another thing!",1
4372,"Why is he ashamed of it?""  ""Because,"" he said earnestly, ""every time he wants to lie in bed until two o'clock in the afternoon, he hears the voice of his old man----""  ""His old man?""  ""Sure. His father. He nodded vigorously.",1
4373,"But Edison's father has been dead for years, hasn't he?""  ""Sure--but that doesn't matter. He hears him just the same. Every time he rolls over to get an extra hour or two, I'll bet you he hears old Pa Edison hollering at him from the foot of the stairs, telling him to get up, and that he's not worth powder enough to blow him sky high, and that when he was his age, he'd been up four hours already and done a whole day's work--poor, miserable orphan that he was!""  ""Really, I didn't know that.",1
4374,"Was Edison's father an orphan?""  ""Sure--they all are when they holler at you from the foot of the stairs. And school was always at least six miles away, and they were always barefooted, and it was always snowing. God! he laughed suddenly. No one's old man ever went to school except under polar conditions. They all did. And that's why you get up, that's why you drive yourself, because you're afraid not to--afraid of 'that damned Joyner blood in you.'... So I'm afraid that's the way it's going to be with me until the end of my days. Every time I see the Ile de France or the Aquitania or the Berengaria backing into the river and swinging into line on Saturday, and see the funnels with their racing slant, and the white breasts of the great liners, and something catches at my throat, and suddenly I hear mermaids singing--I'll also hear the voice of the old man yelling at me from as far as back as I can remember, and telling me I'm not worth the powder to blow me up. And every time I dream of tropic isles, of plucking breadfruit from the trees, or of lying stretched out beneath a palm-tree in Samoa, fanned by an attractive lady of those regions clad in her latest string of beads--I'll hear the voice of the old man. Every time I dream of lying sprawled out with Peter Breughel in Cockaigne, with roast pigs trotting by upon the hoof, and with the funnel of a beer bung in my mouth--I'll hear the voice of the old man. Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all. I'm lazy--but every time I surrender to my baser self, the old man hollers from the stairs. George was full of his own problems and talked about them constantly.",1
4375,"Randy was an understanding listener. But suddenly one day, towards the end of Randy's visit, the thought struck George as strange that his friend should be taking so much time off from his job. He asked Randy about it. How had he managed it?",1
4376,"I haven't got a job,"" Randy answered quietly with his little embarrassed laugh. They threw me out. You mean to say that that bastard Merrit--",1
4377,"George began, hot with instant anger. Oh, don't blame him,"" Randy broke in. He couldn't help it. The higher-ups were on his tail and he had to do it. He said I wasn't getting the business, and it's true--I wasn't. But what the Company doesn't know is that nobody can get the business any more. It isn't there, and hasn't been for the last year or so. You saw how it was when you were home. Every penny anybody could get hold of went into real estate speculation. That was the only business they had left down there. And now, of course, that's gone, too, since the bank failed. And do you mean to say,"" George commented, speaking the words slowly and with emphasis--""do you mean to say that Merrit seized that moment to throw you out on your ear?",1
4378,"Why, the dirty----""  ""Yes,"" said Randy. I got the sack just a week after the bank closed. I don't know whether Merrit figured that was the best time to get rid of me or whether it just happened so. But what's the difference? It's been coming for a long time. I've seen it coming for a year or more. It was just a question of when. And believe me,"" he said with quiet emphasis, ""I've been through hell. I lived from day to day in fear and dread of it, knowing it was coming and knowing there wasn't anything I could do to head it off. But the funny thing is, now it's happened I feel relieved. He smiled his old clear smile. It's the truth,"" he said. I never would have had the guts to quit--I was making pretty good money, you know--but now that I'm out, I'm glad. I'd forgotten how it felt to be a free man. Now I can hold my head up and look anybody in the eye and tell the Great Man, Paul S. Appleton himself, to go to the devil. It's a good feeling. I like it. But what are you going to do, Randy?"" asked George with evident concern.",1
4379,"I don't know,"" said Randy cheerfully. I haven't any plans. All the years I was with the Company I lived pretty well, but I also managed to save a little something. And, luckily, I didn't put it in the Citizens Trust, or in real estate either, so I've still got it. And I own the old family house. Margaret and I can get along all right for a while. Of course, jobs that pay as well as the one I had don't turn up round every corner, but this is a big country and there's always a place for a good man. Did you ever hear of a good man who couldn't find work?"" he said.",1
4380,"Well, you can't be too sure of that,"" said George, shaking his head dubiously. Maybe I'm wrong,"" he went on, pausing and frowning thoughtfully, ""but I don't think the Stock Market crash and the bank failure in Libya Hill were isolated events. I'm coming to feel,"" he said, ""that we may be up against something new--something that's going to cut deeper than anything America has experienced before. The papers are beginning to take it seriously. They're calling it a depression. Everybody seems to be scared. Oh, pshaw!"" said Randy with a laugh.",1
4381,"You are feeling low. That's because you live in New York. Here the Stock Market is everything. When it's high, times are good; when it's low, they're bad. But New York is not America. I know,"" said George.",1
4382,"But I'm not thinking about the Stock Market. I'm thinking about America... Sometimes it seems to me,"" he continued slowly, like a man who gropes his way in darkness over an unfamiliar road, ""that America went off the track somewhere--back round the time of the Civil War, or pretty soon afterwards. Instead of going ahead and developing along the line in which the country started out, it got shunted off in another direction--and now we look round and see we've gone places we didn't mean to go. Suddenly we realise that America has turned into something ugly--and vicious--and corroded at the heart of its power with easy wealth and graft and special privilege... And the worst of it is the intellectual dishonesty which all this corruption has bred. People are afraid to think straight--afraid to face themselves--afraid to look at things and see them as they are. We've become like a nation of advertising men, all hiding behind catch phrases like 'prosperity' and 'rugged individualism' and 'the American way'. And the real things like freedom, and equal opportunity, and the integrity and worth of the individual--things that have belonged to the American dream since the beginning--they have become just words, too. The substance has gone out of them--they're not real any more...Take your own case. You say you feel free at last because you've lost your job. I don't doubt it--but it's a funny kind of freedom. And just how free are you?""  ""Well, free enough to suit me,"" said Randy heartily.",1
4383,"And, funny or not, I'm freer than I've ever been before. Free enough to take my time and look round a bit before I make a new connection. I don't want to get in with another outfit like the old one. I'll land on my feet,"" he said serenely.",1
4384,"But how are you going to do it?"" asked George. There can't be anything for you in Libya Hill, with the bottom dropped out of everything down there. Hell, I'm not wedded to the place!"" said Randy.",1
4385,"I'll go anywhere. Remember, I've been a salesman all my life--I'm used to travelling round. And I have friends in the game--in other lines--who'll help me. That's one good thing about being a salesman: if you can sell one thing, you can sell anything, and it's easy to switch products. I know my way round,"" he concluded with strong confidence. Don't you worry about me. They said very little more about it.",1
4386,"And when Randy left, his parting words at the station were:  ""Well, so long, fellow! You're going to be all right. But don't forget to kill that wounded faun! As for me, I don't know just what the next move is, but I'm on my way!",1
4387,"With that he got aboard his train, and was gone. But George wasn't too sure about Randy. And the more he thought about him, the less sure he became. Randy had certainly not been licked by what had happened to him, and that was good; but there was something about his attitude--his cheerful optimism in the face of disaster--that seemed spurious. He had the clearest head of anybody George knew, but it was almost as if he had shut off one compartment of his brain and wasn't using at. It was all very puzzling.",1
4388,"There are tides in the affairs of men,"" George thought musingly--""definite periods of ebb and flow... And when they come, they come, and can't be held back by wishing. That was it, perhaps.",1
4389,"It seemed to George that Randy was caught in the ebb and didn't know it. And that was what made it so queer and puzzling--that he, of all people, shouldn't know it. Also, he had spoken about not wanting to get mixed up with another outfit like the old one. Did he think the fearful pressures he had been subject to were peculiar to the company he had been working for, and that their counterparts existed nowhere else? Did he suppose he could escape those conditions just by changing jobs? Did he believe it was possible by such a shift to enjoy all the glorious advantages he had ever dreamed of as a bright, ambitious youth--high income and good living far beyond what most men are accustomed to--and to do it without paying the cost in other ways?",1
4390,"What will you have? quoth God; pay for it, and take it,"" said Emerson, in that wonderful essay on ""Compensation"" that every American ought to be required by law to read... Well, that was true. One always paid for it...  Good Lord!",1
4391,"Didn't Randy know you can't go home again? The next few years were terrible ones for all America, and especially terrible for Randy Shepperton. He didn't get another job. He tried everything, but nothing worked. There just weren't any jobs. Men were being let off by the thousands everywhere, and nowhere were new ones being taken on.",1
4392,"After eighteen months his savings were gone, and he was desperate. He had to sell the old family house, and what he got for it was a mere pittance. He and Margaret rented a small apartment, and for another year or so, by careful management, they lived on what the house had brought them. Then that, too, was gone. Randy was on his uppers now. He fell ill, and it was an illness of the spirit more than of the flesh. At last, when there was nothing else to do, he and Margaret moved away from Libya Hill and went to live with the older sister who was married, and stayed there with her husband's family--dependents on the bounty of these kindly strangers.",1
4393,"And at the end of all of this, Randy--he of the clear eyes and the quick intelligence--he who was nobody's fool--he who thought he loved the truth and had always been able to see straight to the heart of most things--Randy went on relief. And by that time George thought he understood it. Behind Randy's tragedy George thought he could see a personal devil in the form of a very bright and plausible young man, oozing confidence and crying: ""Faith! when there was no faith, and dressed like a travelling salesman. Yes, salesmanship had done its job too well. Salesmanship--that commercial brand of special pleading--that devoted servant of self-interest--that sworn enemy of truth. George remembered how Randy had been able to look at his alien problem and see it in the abstract, whole and clear, because there was no self-interest to cast its shadow on his vision. He could save others--himself he could not save, because he could no longer see the truth about himself.",1
4394,"And it seemed to George that Randy's tragedy was the essential tragedy of America. America--the magnificent, unrivalled, unequalled, unbeatable, unshrinkable, supercolossal, 99-and-44-one-hundredths-per-cent-pure, schoolgirl-complexion, covers-the-earth, I'd-walk-a-mile-for-it, four-out-of-five-have-it, his master's-voice, askthe-man-who-owns-one, blueplate-special home of advertising, salesmanship, and special pleading in all its many catchy and beguiling forms. Had not the real rulers of America--the business men--been wrong about the depression from the start? Had they not pooh-poohed it and tried to wipe it out with words, refusing to see it for what it was? Had they not kept saying that prosperity was just round the corner--long after ""prosperity"", so-called, had vanished, and the very corner it was supposed to be round had flattened out and bent into a precipitate downward curve of hunger, want, and desperation?",1
4395,"Well, Randy had been right about the wounded faun. For George knew now that his own self-pity was just his precious egotism coming between him and the truth he strove for as a writer. What Randy didn't know was that business also had its wounded fauns. And they, it seemed, were a species that you could not kill so lightly. For business was the most precious form of egotism--self-interest at its dollar value. Kill that with truth, and what would be left?",1
4396,"A better way of life, perhaps, but it would not be built on business as we know it. BOOK IV. - THE QUEST OF THE FAIR MEDUSA George took Randy's advice and moved. He did not know where to go. All he wanted was to get away as far as possible from Park Avenue, from the aesthetic jungles of the lion hunters, from the half-life of wealth and fashion that had grown like a parasite upon the sound body of America. He went to live in Brooklyn.",1
4397,"He had made a little money from his book, so now he paid his debts and quit the job he held as a teacher at the School for Utility Cultures. From this time on, he earned his precarious living solely by what he wrote. For four years he lived in Brooklyn, and four years in Brooklyn are a geologic age--a single stratum of grey time. They were years of poverty, of desperation, of loneliness unutterable. All about him were the poor, the outcast, the neglected and forsaken people of America, and he was one of them. But life is strong, and year after year it went on round him in all its manifold complexity, rich with its unnoticed and unrecorded little happenings. He saw it all, be took it all in hungrily as part of his experience, he recorded much of it, and in the end he squeezed it dry as he tried to extract its hidden meanings.",1
4398,"And what was he like inside while these grey years were slipping by? What was he up to, what was he doing, what did he want? That's rather hard to tell, because he wanted so many things, but the thing he wanted most was Fame. Those were the years of his concentrated quest of that fair Medusa. He had had his little taste of glory, and it was bitter in his mouth. He thought the reason was that he had not been good enough--and he had not been good enough. Therefore he thought that what be had had was not Fame at all, but only a moment's notoriety. He had been a seven-day wonder--that was all.",1
4399,"Well, he had learned some things since he wrote his first book. He would try again. So he lived and wrote, and wrote and lived, and lived there by himself in Brooklyn. And when he had worked for hours at a stretch, forgetting food and sleep and everything, he would rise from his desk at last and stagger forth into the night-time streets, reeling like a drunkard with his weariness. He would eat his supper at a restaurant, and then, because his mind was feverish and he knew he could not sleep, he would walk to Brooklyn Bridge and cross It to Manhattan, and ferret out the secret heart of darkness in all the city's ways, and then at dawn come back across the Bridge once more, and so to bed in Brooklyn.",1
4400,"And in these nightly wanderings the old refusals dropped away, the old avowals stood. For then, somehow, it seemed to him that he who had been dead was risen, be who had been lost was found again, and be who in his brief day of glory bad sold the talent, the passion, and the belief of youth into the keeping of the fleshless dead, until his heart was corrupted and all hope gone, would win his life back bloodily, in solitude and darkness. And be felt then that things would be for him once more as they had been, and he saw again, as be bad once seen, the image of the shining city. Far-flung, and blazing into into tiers of jewelled light, it burned forever in his vision as he walked the Bridge, and strong tides were bound round it, and the great ships called. So he walked the Bridge, always be walked the Bridge.",1
4401,"And by his side was that stern friend, the only one to whom be spoke what in his secret heart he most desired. To Loneliness he whispered: ""Fame!""--and Loneliness replied: ""Aye, brother, wait and see. 27. The Locusts Have No King The tragic light of evening falls upon the huge and rusty jungle of South Brooklyn. It falls without glare or warmth upon the faces of all the men with dead eyes and flesh of tallow-grey as they lean upon their window-sills at the sad, hushed end of day.",1
4402,"If at such a time you walk down this narrow street, between the mean and shabby houses, past the eyes of all the men who lean there quietly at their open windows in their shirt-sleeves, and turn in at the alley here and follow the two-foot strip of broken concrete pavement that skirts the alley on one side, and go to the very last shabby house down at the end, and climb up the flight of worn steps to the front entrance and knock loudly at the door with your bare knuckles (the bell is out of order) and then wait patiently until someone comes, and ask whether Mr. George Webber lives here, you will be informed that he most certainly does, and that if you will just come in and go down this stairway to the basement and knock at the door there on your right, you will probably find him in. So you go down the stairway to the damp and gloomy basement hall, thread your way between the dusty old boxes, derelict furniture, and other lumber stored there in the passage, rap on the door that has been indicated to you, and Mr. Webber himself will open it and usher you right into his room, his home, his castle. The place may seem to you more like a dungeon than a room that a man would voluntarily elect to live in. It is long and narrow, running parallel to the hall from front to rear, and the only natural light that enters it comes through two small windows rather high up in the wall, facing each other at the opposite ends, and these are heavily guarded with iron bars, placed there by some past owner of the house to keep the South Brooklyn thugs from breaking in.",1
4403,"The room is furnished adequately but not so luxuriously as to deprive it of a certain functional and Spartan simplicity. In the back half there is an iron bed with sagging springs, a broken-down dresser with a cracked mirror above it, two kitchen chairs, and a steamer trunk and some old suitcases that have seen much use. At the front end, under the yellow glow of an electric light suspended from the ceiling by a cord, there is a large desk, very much scarred and battered, with the handles missing on most of the drawers, and in front of it there is a straight-backed chair made out of some old, dark wood. In the centre, ranged against the walls, where they serve to draw the two ends of the room together into aesthetic unity, stand an ancient gate-legged table, so much of its dark green paint flaked off that the dainty pink complexion of its forgotten youth shows through all over, a tier of book-shelves, unpainted, and two large crates or packing-cases, their thick top boards pried off to reveal great stacks of ledgers and of white and yellow manuscript within. On top of the desk, on the table, on the book-shelves, and all over the floor are scattered, like fallen leaves in autumn woods, immense masses of loose paper with writing on every sheet, and everywhere are books, piled up on their sides or leaning crazily against each other.",1
4404,"This dark cellar is George Webber's abode and working quarters. Here, in winter, the walls, which sink four feet below the level of the ground, sweat continuously with clammy drops of water. Here, in summer, it is he who does the sweating.",1
4405,"His neighbours, he will tell you, are for the most part Armenians, Italians, Spaniards, Irishmen, and Jews--in short, Americans. They live in all the shacks, tenements, and slums in all the raw, rusty streets and alleys of South Brooklyn. And what is that you smell?  Oh, that!",1
4406,"Well, you see, he shares impartially with his neighbours a piece of public property in the vicinity; it belongs to all of them in common, and it gives to South Brooklyn its own distinctive atmosphere. It is the old Gowanus Canal, and that aroma you speak of is nothing but the huge symphonic stink of it, cunningly compacted of unnumbered separate putrefactions. It is interesting sometimes to try to count them. There is in it not only the noisome stenches of a stagnant sewer, but also the smells of melted glue, burned rubber, and smouldering rags, the odours of a boneyard horse, long dead, the incense of putrefying offal, the fragrance of deceased, decaying cats, old tomatoes, rotten cabbage, and prehistoric eggs.",1
4407,"And how does he stand it? Well, one gets used to it. One can get used to anything, just as all these other people do. They never think of the smell, they never speak of it, they'd probably miss it if they moved away.",1
4408,"To this place, then, George Webber has come, and here ""holed in"" with a kind of dogged stubbornness touched with desperation. And you will not be far wrong if you surmise that he has come here deliberately, driven by a resolution to seek out the most forlorn and isolated hiding spot that he could find. Mr. Marple, a gentleman who has a room on the second floor, comes stumbling down the darkened basement stairway with a bottle in his hand and knocks upon George Webber's door.",1
4409,"Come in!""  Mr. Marple comes in, introduces himself, does the right thing with the bottle, sits down, and begins to make talk. Well, now, Mr. Webber, how d'yah like that drink I mixed for yah?""  ""Oh, I like it, I like it. Well, now, if yah don't, I want yah t'come right out an' say so.",1
4410,"Oh, I would, I would. I mean I'd like to know. I'd appreciate yah tellin' me. What I mean is, I made that stuff myself from a little private formuler I got--I wouldn't buy no stuff from a bootlegger--I wouldn't take no chance wit' the bastards. I buy the alcohol that goes into that drink from a place I know, an' I always know what I'm gettin'--d'yah know what I mean?""  ""Yes, I certainly do.",1
4411,"But I'd like to know what yah think of it, I'd appreciate yah tellin' me. Oh, it's fine, it couldn't be better. I'm glad yah like it, an' you're sure I didn't disturb yah?""  ""Oh, no, not at all.",1
4412,"Because I was on my way in when I sees your light there in the winder, so I says to myself, now that guy may think I've got an orful nerve buttin' in like this but I'm gonna stop an' get acquainted an' ast him if he'd like a little drink. I'm glad you did.",1
4413,"But if I disturbed yah I wantcha t'say so. Oh, no, not at all.""  ""Because here's the way it is wit' me. I'm interested in youman nature--I'm a great student of psychology--I can read faces the minute I look at a guy--it's somethin' that I always had--I guess that's why I'm in the insurance game. So when I sees a guy that interests me I wanta get acquainted wit' him an' get his reactions to things. So when I sees your light I says to myself, he may tell me to get the hell outa there but there ain't no harm in tryin'. I'm glad you did.",1
4414,"Now Mr. Webber, I think I'm a pretty good judge of character----""  ""Oh, I'm sure you are. --an' I been lookin' at yah an' sorta sizin' yah up while yah been sittin' there. Yah didn't know I was sizin' yah up but that's what I been doin' all the time yah been sittin' there because I'm a great student of youman nature, Mr. Webber, an' I gotta size up all grades an' classes every day in my business--you know--I'm in the insurance game. An' I wanna ast yah a question. Now if it's too personal I wantcha t'come right out an' say so, but if yah don't mind answerin' I'm gonna ast it to yah. Not at all.",1
4415,"What is it?""  ""Well, Mr. Webber, I already reached my own conclusions, but I'm gonna ast it to yah just t'see if it don't bear me out. Now what I'm gonna ast yah--an' yah don't have to answer if yah don't want to--is--What's your line?--What business are yah in? Now yah don't need to tell me if it's too personal. Not at all.",1
4416,"I'm a writer. A what?""  ""A writer. I wrote a book once. I'm trying to write another one now. Well now, it may surprise yah",1
4417,"but that's just what I figgered out myself. I says to myself, now there's a guy, I says, that's in some kind of intelleckshul work where he's got t'use his head. He's a writer or a newspaperman or in the advertisin' business. Y'see I've always been a great judge of youman nature--that's my line. Yes, I see.",1
4418,"An' now I wanna tell yah somethin' else, Mr. Webber. You're doin' the thing yah was cut out for, you're doin' the thing yah was born to do, it's what yah been preparin' to do all your life sinct yah was a kid--am I right or wrong? Oh, I guess you're right.",1
4419,"An' that's the reason you're gonna be a big success at it. Stick to writin', Mr. Webber. I'm a great judge of youman nature an' I know what I'm talkin' about. Just stick to the thing yah always wanted to be an' yah'll get there. Now some guys never find theirselves. Some guys never know what they wanna be. That's the trouble wit' some guys. Now wit' me it's different. I didn't find myself till I was a grown man. You'd have t'laugh, Mr. Webber, if I told yah what it was I wanted t'be when I was a kid. What was it, Mr. Marple?""  ""Say, Mr. Webber--y'know it's funny--yah won't believe me--but up to the time I was about twenty years old, a grown man, I was crazy to be a railway engineer.",1
4420,"No kiddin'. I was nuts about it. An' I'd a-been just crazy enough to've gone ahead an' got a job on the railway if the old man hadn't yanked me by the collar an' told me t'snap out of it. Yah know I'm a Down-Easter by birth--don't talk like it any more--I been here too long--but that's where I grew up. My old man was a plumber in Augusta, Maine. So when I tells him I'm gonna be a locomotive engineer he boots me one in the seat of the pants an' tells me I ain't no such thing. 'I've sent yah to school,' he says, 'you've had ten times the schoolin' that I had, an' now yah tell me that you're gonna be a railway hogger. Well, you're not,' the old man says, 'you're gonna be one member of the fambly that's comin' home at night wit' clean hands an' a white collar. Now you get the hell outa here an' hunt yah up a job in some decent high-class business where yah'll have a chanct t'advance an' associate wit' your social ekals.' Jesus! It was a lucky thing for me he took that stand or I'd never a-got where I am to-day. But I was good an' sore about it at the time. An' say, Mr. Webber--you're gonna laugh when I tell yah this one--I ain't actually over the darn thing yet. No kiddin'. When I see one of these big engines bargin' down the track I still get that funny crawly feelin' I usta have when I was a kid an' looked at 'em. The guys at the office had t'laugh about it when I told 'em, an' now when I come in they call me Casey Jones.--Well, what d'yah say yah have another little snifter before I go?""  ""Thanks, I'd like to, but maybe I'd better not.",1
4421,"I've still got a little work I ought to do before I turn in. Well now, Mr. Webber, I know just how it is. An' that's the way I had yah sized up from the first. That guy's a writer, I says, or in some sort of intelleckshul occupation where he's got to use his head--was I right or wrong? Oh, you were right.",1
4422,"Wel!, I'm glad to've metcha, Mr. Webber. Don't make yourself a stranger round here. Yah know, a guy gets sorta lonely sometimes. My wife died four years ago so I been livin' upstairs here ever sinct--sorta figgered that a single guy didn't need no more room than I got here. Come up to see me. I'm interested in youman nature an' 1 like to talk to people an' get their different reactions. So any time yah feel like chewin' the rag a bit, drop in. Oh, I will, I will.",1
4423,"Good night, Mr. Webber. Good night, Mr. Marple. Good night.",1
4424,"Good night. Good night. Across the basement hall, in another room similar to George Webber's, lived an old man by the name of Wakefield. He had a son somewhere in New York who paid his rent, but Mr. Wakefield rarely saw his son. He was a brisk and birdy little man with a chirping, cheerful voice; and, although he was almost ninety, he always seemed to be in good health and was still immensely active. His son had provided him with a room to live in, and he had a little money of his own--a few dollars a month from a pension--enough to supply his meagre wants; but he lived a life of utter loneliness, seeing his son only on the occasion of a holiday or a rare visit, and the rest of the time living all by himself in his basement room.",1
4425,"Yet he had as brave and proud a spirit as any man on earth. He longed desperately for companionship, but he would have died rather than admit he was lonely. So independent was he, and so sensitive, that, while he was always courteous and cheerful, his tone when he responded to a greeting was a little cold and distant, lest anyone should think he was too forward and eager. But, once satisfied of one's friendliness, no one could respond more warmly or more cordially than old man Wakefield.",1
4426,"George grew fond of him and liked to talk with him, and the old man would invite him eagerly into his part of the basement and proudly display his room, which he kept with a soldierlike neatness. He was a veteran of the Union Army in the Civil War, and his room was filled with books, records, papers, and old clippings bearing on the war and on the part his regiment had played in it. Although he was alert and eager towards the life round him, and much too brave and hopeful a spirit to live mournfully in the past, the Civil War had been the great and central event in old man Wakefield's life. Like many of the men of his generation, both North and South, it had never occurred to him that the war was not the central event in everyone's life. Because it was so with him, he believed that people everywhere still lived and thought and talked about the war all the time.",1
4427,"He was a leading figure in the activities of his Grand Army Post, and was always bustling about with plans and projects for the coming year. It seemed to him that the Grand Army organisation, whose thinning ranks of old and feeble men he still saw with the proud eyes of forty or fifty years before, was the most powerful society in the nation, and that its word of warning or stern reproof was enough to make all the kings of the earth quake and tremble in their boots. He was bitterly scornful and would bristle up immediately at mention of the American Legion: he fancied slights and cunning trickery on the part of this body all the time, and he would ruffle up like a rooster when he spoke of the Legionnaires, and say in an angry, chirping voice:  ""It's jealousy!",1
4428,"Nothing in the world but sheer tar-nation jealousy--that's what it is! But why, Mr. Wakefield? Why should they be jealous of you?""  ""Because we reely did some soldierin'--that's why!",1
4429,"he chirped angrily. Because they know we fit the Rebels--yes! and fit 'em good--and licked 'em, too! he cackled triumphantly--""in a war that was a war!...Pshaw! he said scornfully, in a lowered voice, looking out the window with a bitter smile and with eyes that had suddenly grown misty. What do these fellows know about a war?--Some bob-tail--raggedy--two-by-two--little jackleg feller--of a Legionnary! He spat the words out with a malignant satisfaction, breaking at the end into a vindictive cackle. Standin' to their necks all day in some old trench and never gettin' within ten miles of the enemy! he sneered. If they ever saw a troop of cavalry, I don't know what they'd make of it! I reckon they'd think it was the circus come to town! he cackled. A war! A war! Hell-fire, that warn't no war! he cried derisively. If they wanted to see a war, they should've been with us at the Bloody Angle! But, pshaw! he said. They'd a-run like rabbits if they'd been there! The only way you could a-kept 'em would've been to tie 'em to a tree!""  ""Don't you think they could have beaten the Rebels, Mr. Wakefield?""  ""Beat 'em?",1
4430,"he shrilled. Beat 'em! Why, boy, what are you talkin' about?...Hell! If Stonewall Jackson ever started for that gang, he'd run 'em ragged! Yes, sir! They'd light out so fast they'd straighten out all the bends of the road as they went by! cried old man Wakefield, cackling. Pshaw! he said quietly and scornfully again. They couldn't do it! It ain't in 'em!... But I'll tell you this much! he cried suddenly in an excited voice. We're not goin' to put up with it much longer! The boys have had just about as much of it as they can stand! If they try to do us like they done last year--pshaw! he broke off again, and looked out the window shaking his head--""Why it's all as plain as the nose on your face! It's jealousy--just plain, confounded jealousy--that's all in the world it is!""  ""What is, Mr. Wakefield?""  ""Why, the way they done us last year!",1
4431,"he cried. Puttin' us way back there at the tail-end of the pee-rade, when by all the rights--as everybody knows--we should've come first! But we'll fix 'em! he cried warningly. We've got a way to fix 'em! he said with a triumphant shake of the head. I know the thing we're goin' to do this year,"" he cried, ""if they try another trick like that on us!""  ""What are you going to do, Mr. Wakefield?""  ""Why,"" he cackled, ""we won't pee-rade!",1
4432,"We simply won't pee-rade! We'll tell 'em they can hold their derned pee-rade without us! he chirped exultantly. And I reckon that'll fix 'em! Oh yes! That'll bring 'em round, or I miss my guess! he crowed.",1
4433,"It ought to, Mr. Wakefield. Why, boy,"" he said solemnly, ""if we ever did a thing like that, there would be a wave of protest--a wave of protest""--he cried with a sweeping gesture of the arm, as his voice rose strongly--""from here to Californy!... The people wouldn't stand for it! he cried. They'd make those fellers back down in a hurry!",1
4434,"And as George left him, the old man would come with him to the door, shake his hand warmly and, with an eager and lonely look in his old eyes, say:  ""Come again, boy! I'm always glad to see you!... I got stuff in here--photygraphs an' books, an' such as that about the war--that you ain't seen yet. No, nor no one else! he cackled. For no one else has got 'em!...Just let me know when you're comin' an' I'll be here. Slowly the years crept by and George lived alone in Brooklyn.",1
4435,"They were hard years, desperate years, lonely years, years of interminable writing and experimentation, years of exploration and discovery, years of grey timelessness, weariness, exhaustion, and self-doubt. He had reached the wilderness period of his life and was hacking his way through the jungles of experience. He had stripped himself down to the brutal facts of self and work. These were all he had.",1
4436,"He saw himself more clearly now than he had ever done before, and, in spite of living thus alone, he no longer thought of himself as a rare and special person who was doomed to isolation, but as a man who worked and who, like other men, was a part of life. He was concerned passionately with reality. He wanted to see things whole, to find out everything he could, and then to create out of what he knew the fruit of his own vision.",1
4437,"One criticism that had been made of his first book still rankled in his mind. An unsuccessful scribbler turned critic had simply dismissed the whole book as a ""barbaric yawp"", accusing Webber of getting at things with his emotions rather than with his brains, and of being hostile towards the processes of the intellect and ""the intellectual point of view. These charges, if they had any truth in them, seemed to George to be the kind of lifeless half-truth that was worse than no truth at all. The trouble with the so-called ""intellectuals"" was that they were not intellectual enough, and their point of view more often than not had no point, but was disparate, arbitrary, sporadic, and confused.",1
4438,"To be an ""intellectual"" was, it seemed, a vastly different thing from being intelligent. A dog's nose would usually lead him towards what he wished to find, or away from what he wished to avoid: this was intelligent. That is, the dog had the sense of reality in his nose. But the ""intellectual"" usually had no nose, and was lacking in the sense of reality. The most striking difference between Webber's mind and the mind of the average ""intellectual"" was that Webber absorbed experience like a sponge, and made use of everything that he absorbed. He really learned constantly from experience. But the ""intellectuals"" of his acquaintance seemed to learn nothing. They had no capacity for rumination and digestion. They could not reflect.",1
4439,"He thought over a few of them that he had known:  There was Haythorpe, who when George first knew him was an esthete of the late baroque in painting, writing all the arts, author of one-act costume plays--""Gesmonder! Thy hands pale chalices of hot desire! Later he became an esthete of the primitives--the Greek, Italian, and the German; then esthete of the nigger cults--the wood sculptures, coon songs, hymnals, dances, and the rest; still later, esthete of the comics--of cartoons, Chaplin, and the Brothers Marx; then of Expressionism; then of the Mass; then of Russia and the Revolution; at length, esthete of homo-sexuality; and finally, death's esthete--suicide in a graveyard in Connecticut.",1
4440,"There was Collingswood, who, fresh out of Harvard, was not so much the esthete of the arts as of the mind. First, a Bolshevik from Beacon Hill, practitioner of promiscuous, communal love as the necessary answer to ""bourgeois morality""; then back to Cambridge for post-graduate study at the feet of Irving Babbitt--Collingswood is now a Humanist, the bitter enemy of Rousseau, Romanticism, and of Russia (which is, he now thinks, Rousseau in modern form); the playwright, next--New Jersey, Beacon Hill, or Central Park seen in the classic unities of the Greek drama; at length, disgusted realist--""all that's good in modern art or letters is to be found in advertisements""; then a job as a scenario writer and two years in Hollywood--all now is the moving picture, with easy money, easy love affairs, and drunkenness; and finally, back to Russia, but with his first love lacking--no sex triflings now, my comrades--we who serve the Cause and wait upon the day lead lives of Spartan abstinence--what was the free life, free love, enlightened pleasure of the proletariat ten years ago is now despised as the contemptible debauchery of ""bourgeois decadence"". There was Spurgeon from the teaching days at the School for Utility Cultures--good Spurgeon--Chester Spurgeon of the Ph.D.--Spurgeon of ""the great tradition""--thin-lipped Spurgeon, ex-student of Professor Stuart Sherman, and bearer-onwards of the Master's Torch. Noble-hearted Spurgeon, who wrote honeyed flatteries of Thornton Wilder and his Bridge--""The tradition of the Bridge is Love, just as the tradition of America and of Democracy is Love. Hence""--Spurgeon hences--Love grows Wilder as the years Bridge on across America. Oh, where now, good Spurgeon, ""intellectual"" Spurgeon--Spurgeon whose thin lips and narrowed eyes were always so glacial prim on Definitions? Where now, brave intellect, by passion uninflamed? Spurgeon of the flashing mind, by emotion unimpulsed, is now a devoted leader of the intellectual Communists (See Spurgeon's article entitled: ""Mr. Wilder's Piffle"", in the New Masses).--So, Comrade Spurgeon, hail! Hail, Comrade Spurgeon--and most heartily, my bright-eyed Intellectual, farewell!",1
4441,"Whatever George Webber was, he knew he was not an ""intellectual"". He was just an American who was looking hard at the life round him, and sorting carefully through all the life he had ever seen and known, and trying to extract some essential truth out of this welter of his whole experience. But, as he said to his friend and editor, Fox Edwards:  ""What is truth?",1
4442,"No wonder jesting Pilate turned away. The truth, it has a thousand faces--show only one of them, and the whole truth flies away! But how to show the whole? That's the question...  ""Discovery in itself is not enough.",1
4443,"It's not enough to find out what things are. You've also got to find out where they come from, where each brick fits in the wall. He always came back to the wall.",1
4444,"I think it's like this,"" he said. You see a wall, you look at it so much and so hard that one day you see clear through it. Then, of course, it's not just one wall any longer. It's every wall that ever was. He was still spiritually fighting out the battle of his first book, and all the problems it had raised.",1
4445,"He was still searching for a way. At times he felt that his first book had taught him nothing--not even confidence. His feelings of hollow desperation and self-doubt seemed to grow worse instead of better, for he had now torn himself free from almost every personal tie which had ever bound him, and which formerly had sustained him in some degree with encouragement and faith. He was left, therefore, to rely almost completely on his own resources.",1
4446,"There was also the insistent, gnawing consciousness of work itself, the necessity of turning towards the future and the completion of a new book. He was feeling, now as never before, the inexorable pressure of time. In writing his first book, he had been unknown And obscure, and there had been a certain fortifying strength in that, for no one had expected anything of him. But now the spotlight of publication had been turned upon him, and he felt it beating down with merciless intensity. He was pinned beneath the light--he could not crawl out of it. Though he had not won fame, still he was known now. He had been examined, probed, and talked about. He felt that the world was looking at him with a critic eye.",1
4447,"It had been easy in his dreams to envision a long and fluent sequence of big books, but now he was finding it a different matter to accomplish them. His first book had been more an act of utterance than an act of labour. It was an impassioned expletive of youth--something that had been pent up in him, something felt and seen and imagined and put down at white-hot heat. The writing of it had been a process of spiritual and emotional evacuation. But that was behind him now, and he knew he should never try to repeat it. Henceforth his writing would have to come from unending labour and preparation.",1
4448,"In his effort to explore his experience, to extract the whole, essential truth of it, and to find a way to write about it, he sought to recapture every particle of the life he knew down to its minutest details. He spent weeks and months trying to put down on paper the exactitudes of countless fragments--what he called: ""the dry, caked colours of America""--how the entrance to a subway looked, the design and webbing of the elevated structure, the look and feel of an iron rail, the particular shade of rusty green with which so many things are painted in America. Then he tried to pin down the foggy colour of the brick of which so much of London is constructed, the look of an English doorway, of a French window, of the roofs and chimney-pots of Paris, of a whole street in Munich--and each of these foreign things he then examined in contrast to its American equivalent.",1
4449,"It was a process of discovery in its most naked, literal, and primitive terms. He was just beginning really to see thousands of things for the first time, to see the relations between them, to see here and there whole series and systems of relations. He was like a scientist in some new field of chemistry who for the first time realises that he has stumbled upon a vast new world, and who will then pick out identities, establish affiliations, define here and there the outlines of sub-systems in crystalline union, without yet being aware what the structure of the whole is like, or what the final end will be.",1
4450,"The same processes now began to inform his direct observation of the life round him. Thus, on his nocturnal ramblings about New York, he would observe the homeless men who prowled in the vicinity of restaurants, lifting the lids of garbage cans and searching round inside for morsels of rotten food. He saw them everywhere, and noticed how their numbers increased during the hard and desperate days of 1932. He knew what kind of men they were, for he talked to many of them; he knew what they had been, where they had come from, and even what kind of scraps they could expect to dig out of the garbage cans. He found out the various places all over the city where such men slept at night. A favourite rendezvous was a corridor of the subway station at Thirty-third Street and Park Avenue in Manhattan. There one night he counted thirty-four huddled together on the cold concrete, wrapped up in sheathings of old newspaper.",1
4451,"It was his custom almost every night, at one o'clock or later, to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, and night after night, with a horrible fascination, he used to go to the public latrine or ""comfort station"" which was directly in front of the New York City Hall. One descended to this place down a steep flight of stairs from the street, and on bitter nights he would find the place crowded with homeless men who had sought refuge there. Some were those shambling hulks that one sees everywhere, in Paris as well as New York, in good times as well as bad--old men, all rags and bags and long white hair and bushy beards stained dirty yellow, wearing tattered overcoats in the cavernous pockets of which they carefully stored away all the little rubbish they lived on and spent their days collecting in the streets--crusts of bread, old bones with rancid shreds of meat still clinging to them, and dozens of cigarette-butts. Some were the ""stumble bums"" from the Bowery, criminal, fumed with drink or drugs, or half insane with ""smoke"". But most of them were just flotsam of the general ruin of the time--honest, decent, middle-aged men with faces seamed by toil and want, and young men, many of them mere boys in their teens, with thick, unkempt hair. These were the wanderers from town to town, the riders of freight trains, the thumbers of rides on highways, the uprooted, unwanted male population of America. They drifted across the land and gathered in the big cities when winter came, hungry, defeated, empty, hopeless, restless, driven by they knew not what, always on the move, looking everywhere for work, for the bare crumbs to support their miserable lives, and finding neither work nor crumbs. Here in New York, to this obscene meeting-place, these derelicts came, drawn into a common stew of rest and warmth and a little surcease from their desperation.",1
4452,"George had never before witnessed anything to equal the indignity and sheer animal horror of the scene. There was even a kind of devil's comedy in the sight of all these filthy men squatting upon those open, doorless stools. Arguments and savage disputes and fights would sometimes break out among them over the possession of these stools, which all of them wanted more for rest than for necessity. The sight was revolting, disgusting, enough to render a man forever speechless with very pity.",1
4453,"He would talk to the men and find out all he could about them, and when he could stand it no more he would come out of this hole of filth and suffering, and there, twenty feet above it, he would see the giant hackles of Manhattan shining coldly in the cruel brightness of the winter night. The Woolworth Building was not fifty yards away, and, a little farther down were the silvery spires and needles of Wall Street, great fortresses of stone and steel that housed enormous hanks. The blind injustice of this contrast seemed the most brutal part of the whole experience, for there, all round him in the cold moonlight, only a few blocks away from this abyss of human wretchedness and misery, blazed the pinnacle of power where a large portion of the entire world's wealth was locked in mighty vaults.",1
4454,"They were now dosing up the restaurant. The tired waitresses were racking the chairs upon the tables, completing the last formalities of their hard day's work in preparation for departure. At the cash register the proprietor was totting up the figures of the day's take, and one of the male waiters hovered watchfully near the table, in a manner politely indicating that while he was not in a hurry he would be glad if the last customer would pay his bill and leave.",1
4455,"George called for his check and gave the man some money. He took it and in a moment returned with the change. He pocketed his tip and said: ""Thank you, sir. Then as George said good night and started to get up and leave, the waiter hesitated and hung round uncertainly as if there was something he wanted to say but scarcely knew whether he ought to say it or not.",1
4456,"George looked at him inquiringly, and then, in a rather embarrassed tone, the waiter said:  ""Mr. Webber...there's...something I'd like to talk over with you sometime...I--I'd like to get your advice about something--that is, if you have time,"" he added hastily and almost apologetically. George regarded the waiter with another inquiring look,-in which the man evidently read encouragement, for now he went on quickly, in a manner of almost beseeching entreaty:  ""It's--it's about a story. The familiar phrase awakened countless weary echoes in Webber's memory.",1
4457,"It also resolved that hard and honest patience with which any man who ever sweated to write a living line and to earn his bread by the hard, uncertain labour of his pen will listen, as an act of duty and understanding, to any other man who says he has a tale to tell. His mind and will wearily composed themselves, his face set in a strained smile of mechanical anticipation, and the poor waiter, thus encouraged, went on eagerly:  ""It's--it's a story a guy told me several years ago. I've been thinking about it ever since. The guy was a foreigner,"" said the waiter impressively, as if this fact was enough to guarantee the rare colour and fascinating interest of what he was about to reveal. He was an Armenian,"" said the waiter very earnestly. Sure! He came from over there! He nodded his head emphatically. And this story that he told me was an Armenian story,"" said the waiter with solemn emphasis, and then paused to let this impressive fact sink in. It was a story that he knew about--he told it to me--and I'm the only other guy that knows about it,"" said the waiter, and paused again, looking at his patron with a very bright and feverish eye.",1
4458,"George continued to smile with wan encouragement, and in a moment the waiter, after an obvious struggle with his soul, a conflict between his desire to keep his secret and to tell it, too, went on:  ""Gee! You're a writer, Mr. Webber, and you know about these things. I'm just a dumb guy working in a restaurant--but if I could put it into words--if I could get a guy like you who knows how it's done to tell the story for me--why--why""--he struggled with himself, then burst out enthusiastically--""there'd be a fortune in it for the both of us!""  George felt his heart sink still lower.",1
4459,"It was turning out just as he knew it would. But he still continued to smile pallidly. He cleared his throat in an undecided fashion, but then said nothing. And the waiter, taking silence for consent, now pressed on impetuously:  ""Honest, Mr. Webber--if I could get somebody like you to help me with this story--to write it down for me the way it ought to be-I'd--I'd""--for a moment the waiter struggled with his lower nature, then magnanimity got the better of him and he cried out with t",1
4460,"he decided air of a man who is willing to make a generous bargain and stick to it--""I'd go fifty-fifty with him! I'd--I'd be willing to give him half!... And there's a fortune in it! he cried. I go to the movies and I read True Story Magazine--and I never seen a story like it! It's got 'em all beat! I've thought about it for years, ever since the guy told it to me--and I know I've got a gold mine here if I could only write it down!...It's--it's----""  Now, indeed, the waiter's struggle with his sense of caution became painful to watch.",1
4461,"He was evidently burning with a passionate desire to reveal his secret, but he was also obviously tormented by doubts and misgivings lest he should recklessly give away to a comparative stranger a treasure which the other might appropriate to his own use. I I is manner was very much that of a man who has sailed strange seas and seen, in some unknown coral island, the fabulous buried cache of forgotten pirates' plundering, and who is now being torn between two desperate needs--his need of partnership, of outward help, and his imperative need of secrecy and caution. The fierce interplay of these two powers discrete was waged there on the open battlefield of the waiter's countenance. And in the end he took the obvious way out. Like an explorer who will take from his pocket an uncut gem of tremendous size and value and cunningly hint that in a certain place he knows of there are many more like it, the waiter decided to tell a little part of his story without revealing it.",1
4462,"I--I can't tell you the whole thing to-night,"" he said apologetically. Some other night, maybe, when you've got more time. But just to give you an idea of what's in it""--he looked round stealthily to make sure he was in no danger of being overheard, then bent over and lowered his voice to an impressive whisper--""just to give you an idea, now--there's one scene in the story where a woman puts an advertisement in the paper that she will give a ten-dollar gold piece and as much liquor as he can drink to any man who comes round to see her the next day! After imparting this sensational bit of information, the waiter regarded his patron with glittering eyes. Now!"" said the waiter, straightening up with a gesture of finality. You never heard of anything like that, did you? You ain't never seen that in a story!""  George, after a baffled pause, admitted feebly that he had not.",1
4463,"Then, when the waiter continued to regard him feverishly, with a look that made it plain that he was supposed to say something more, he inquired doubtfully whether this interesting event had really happened in Armenia. Sure!"" cried the waiter, nodding vigorously. That's what I'm telling you! The whole thing happens in Armenia! He paused again, torn fiercely between his caution and his desire to go on, his feverish eyes almost burning holes through his questioner. It's--it's--"" he struggled for a moment more, then surrendered; abjectly--""well, I'll tell you,"" he said quietly, leaning forward, with his hands resting on the table in an attitude of confidential intimacy. The idea of the story runs like this. You got this rich dame to begin with, see?""  He paused and looked at George inquiringly.",1
4464,"George did not: know what was expected of him, so he nodded to show that his min had grasped this important fact, and said hesitatingly:  ""In Armenia? Sure! Sure! The waiter nodded. This dame comes from over there--she's got a big pile of dough--I guess she's the richest dame in Armenia. And then she falls for this guy, see? he went on. He's nuts about her, and he comes to see her every night. The way the guy told it to me, she lives up at the top of this big house--so every night the guy comes and climbs up there to see her--oh, a hell of a long ways up""--the waiter said--""thirty floors or more!""  ""In Armenia?",1
4465,"George asked feebly. Sure!"" cried the waiter, a little irritably. That's where it all takes place! That's what I'm telling you!""  He paused and looked searchingly at George, who finally asked, with just the proper note of hesitant thoughtfulness, why the lover had had to climb up so far.",1
4466,"Why,"" said the waiter impatiently, ""because the dame's old man wouldn't let him in! That was the only way the guy could get to her! The old man shut her up way up there at the top of the house because he didn't want the dame to get married!... But then,"" he went on triumphantly, ""the old man dies, see? He dies and leaves all his dough to this dame--and then she ups and marries this guy!",1
4467,"Dramatically, with triumph written in his face, the waiter paused to let this startling news soak into the consciousness of his listener. Then he continued:  ""They lived together for a while--the dame's in love with him--and for a year or two they're sitting pretty. But then the guy begins to drink--he's a booze hound, see?--only she don't know it--she's been able to hold him down for a year or two after they get married...Then he begins to step out again... The first thing you know he's staying out all night and running round with a lot of hot blondes, see?... Well, then, you see what's coming now, don't you?"" said the waiter quickly and eagerly.",1
4468,"George had no notion, but he nodded his head wisely. Well, that's what happens,"" said the waiter. The first thing you know the guy ups and leaves the dame and takes with him a lot of her dough and joolry...He just disappears--just like the earth had opened and swallowed him up! the waiter declared, evidently pleased with his poetic simile. He leaves her cold, and the poor dame's almost out of her head. She does everything--she hires detectives--she offers rewards--she puts ads in the paper begging him to come back... But it's no use--she can't find him--the guy's lost... Well, then,"" the waiter continued, ""three years go by while the poor dame sits and eats her heart out about this guy... And then""--here he paused impressively, and it was evident that he was now approaching the crisis--""then she has an idea! He paused again, briefly, to allow this extraordinary accomplishment on the part of his heroine to be given due consideration, and in a moment, very simply and quietly, he concluded: ""She opens up a night club. The waiter fell silent now, and stood at ease with his hands clasped quietly before him, with the modest air of a man who has given his all and is reasonably assured it is enough.",1
4469,"It now became compellingly apparent that his listener was supposed to make some appropriate comment, and that the narrator could not continue with his tale until this word had been given. So George mustered his failing strength, moistened his dry lips with the end of his tongue, and finally said in a halting voice:  ""In--in Armenia? The waiter now took the question, and the manner of its utterance, as signs of his listener's paralyzed surprise.",1
4470,"He nodded his head victoriously and cried:  ""Sure! You see, the dame's idea is this--she knows the guy's a booze hound and that sooner or later he'll come to a place where there's lots of bar-flies and fast women. That kind always hang together--sure they do!... So she opens up this joint--she sinks a lot of dough in it--it's the swellest joint they got over there. And then she puts this ad in the paper. George was not sure that he had heard aright, but the waiter was looking at him with an expression of such exuberant elation that he took a chance and said:  ""What ad?""  ""Why,"" said the waiter, ""this come-on ad that I was telling you about.",1
4471,"You see, that's the big idea--that's the plan the dame dopes out to get him back. So she puts this ad in the paper saying that any man who comes to her joint the next day will be given a ten-dollar gold piece and all the liquor he can drink. She figures that will bring him. She knows the guy is probably down and out by this time and when he reads this ad he'll show up... And that's just what happens. When she comes down next morning she finds a line twelve blocks long outside, and sure enough, here's this guy the first one in the line. Well, she pulls him out of the line and tells the cashier to give all the rest of 'em their booze and their ten bucks, but she tells this guy he ain't gonna get nothing. 'What's the reason I ain't?' he says--you see, the dame is wearing a heavy veil so he don't recognise her. Well, she tells him she thinks there's something phoney about him--gives him the old line, you know--tells him to come upstairs with her so she can talk to him and find out if he's O.K... Do you get it?""  George nodded vaguely.",1
4472,"And then what?"" he said. Why,"" the waiter cried, ""she gets him up there--and then""--he leaned forward again with fingers resting on the table, and his voice sank to an awed whisper--""she--takes--off--her--veil!""  There was a reverential silence as the waiter, still leaning forward with his fingers arched upon the table, regarded his listener with bright eyes and a strange little smile. Then he straightened up slowly, stood erect, still smiling quietly, and a long, low sigh like the coming on of evening came from his lips, and he was still. The silence drew itself out until it became painful, and at length George squirmed wretchedly in his chair and asked:",1
4473,"And then--then what?""  The waiter was plainly taken aback. He stared in frank astonishment, stunned speechless by the realisation that anybody could be stupid. Why""--he finally managed to say with an expression of utter disillusion--""that's all! Don't you see? That's all there is! The dame takes off her veil--he recognises her--and there you are!... She's found him!... She's got him back!...They're together again!... That's the story! He was hurt, impatient, almost angry as he went on: ""Why, anybody ought to be able to see----""  ""Good night, Joe.",1
4474,"The last waitress was just going out and had spoken to the waiter as she passed the table. She was a blonde, slender girl, neatly dressed Her voice was quiet and full of the casual familiarity of her daily work and association; it was a pleasant voice, and it was a little tired. Her face, as she paused a moment, was etched in light and shadow, and there were little pools of violet beneath her clear grey eyes. Her face had the masklike fragility and loveliness, the almost hair-drawn fine-MSS, that one often sees in young people who have lived in the great city and who have never had wholly enough of anything except work and their own hard youth. One felt instantly sorry for the girl, because one knew that her face would not long be what it was now.",1
4475,"The waiter, interrupted in the flood of his impassioned argument, had been alittle startled by the casual intrusion of the girl's low voice turned towards her. When he saw who it was, his manner changed at once, and his own seamed face softened a little with instinctive and unconscious friendliness. Oh, hello, Billie. Good night, kid. She went out, and the sound of her brisk little heels clacked away on the hard pavement.",1
4476,"For a moment more the waiter continued to look after her, and then, turning back to his sole remaining customer with a queer, indefinable little smile hovering in the hard lines about his mouth, he said very quietly and casually, in the tone men use to speak of things done and known and irrecoverable:  ""Did you see that kid?... She came in here about two years ago and got a job. I don't know where she came from, but it was some little hick town somewhere. She'd been a chorus girl--a hoofer in some cheap road show--until her legs gave out...You find a lot of 'em in this game--the business is full of 'em... Well, she worked here for about a year, and then she began going with a cheap gigolo who used to come in here. You know the kind--you can smell 'em a mile off--they stink. I could've told her! But, hell, what's the use? They won't listen to you--you only get yourself in dutch all round--they got to find out for themselves--you can't teach 'em. So I left it alone--that's the only way... Well, six or eight months ago, some of the girls found out she was pregnant. The boss let her out. He's not a bad guy--but, hell, what can you expect? You can't keep 'em round a place like this when they're in that condition, can you?... She had the kid three months ago, and then she got her job back. I understand she's put the kid in a home somewhere. I've never seen it, but they say it's a swell kid, and Billie's crazy about it--goes out there to see it every Sunday... She's a swell kid, too. The waiter was silent for a moment, and there was a far-off look of tragic but tranquil contemplation in his eyes.",1
4477,"Then, quietly, wearily, he said:  ""Hell, if I could tell you what goes on here every day--the things you see and hear--the people you meet and all that happens. Jesus, I get sick and tired of it. Sometimes I'm so fed up with the whole thing that I don't care if I never see the joint again. Sometimes I get to thinking how swell it would be not to have to spend your whole life waiting on a lot of mugs--just standing round and waiting on 'em and watching 'em come in and out...and feeling sorry for some little kid who's fallen for some dope you wouldn't wipe your feet on...and wondering just how long it'll be before she gets the works... Jesus, I'm fed up with it!",1
4478,"Again he was silent. His eyes looked off into the distance, and his face was set in that expression of mildly cynical regret and acceptance that one often notices in people who have seen much of life, and experienced its hard and seamy side, and who know that there is very little they can do or say. At last he sighed deeply, shook himself, threw off the mood, and resumed his normal manner.",1
4479,"Gee, Mr. Webber,"" he said with a return of his former eagerness, ""it must be great to be able to write books and stories--to have the gift of gab--all that flow of language--to go anywhere you like--to work when you want to! Now, take that story I was telling you about,"" he said earnestly. I never had no education--but if I could only get some guy like you to help me--to write it down the way it ought to be--honest, Mr. Webber, it's a great chance for somebody--there's a fortune in it--I'd go fifty-fifty! His voice was pleading now. A guy I knew one time, he told it to me--and me and him are the only two that knows it. The guy was an Armenian, like I said, and the whole thing happened over there...There'd be a gold mine in it if I only knew how to do it. It was long after midnight, and the round disc of the moon was sinking westward over the cold, deserted streets of slumbering Manhattan.",1
4480,"The party was in full swing now. The gold and marble ballroom of the great hotel had been converted into a sylvan fairyland. In the centre a fountain of classic nymphs and fauns sent up its lighted sprays of water, and here and there about the floor were rustic arbors with climbing roses trailing over them, heavy with scented blossoms. Flowering hot-house trees in tubs were banked round the walls, the shining marble pillars were wreathed about with vines and garlands, and overhead gay lanterns had been strung to illuminate the scene with their gentle glow. The whole effect was that of an open clearing in a forest glade upon Midsummer Night where Queen Titania had come to hold her court and revels.",1
4481,"It was a rare, exotic spectacle, a proper setting for the wealthy, carefree youth for whom it had been planned. The air was heavy with the fragrance of rich perfumes, and vibrant with the throbbing, pulsing rhythms of sensuous music. Upon the polished floor a hundred lovely girls in brilliant evening gowns danced languidly in the close embrace of pink-cheeked boys from Yale and Harvard, their lithe young figures accentuated smartly by the black and white of faultless tailoring.",1
4482,"This was the coming-out party of a fabulously rich young lady, and the like of it had not been seen since the days before the market crashed. The papers had been full of it for weeks. It was said that her father had lost millions in the debacle, but it was apparent that he still had a few paltry dollars left. So now he was doing the right thing, the expected thing, the necessary and inescapable thing, for his beautiful young daughter, who would one day inherit all that these ruinous times had left him of his hard-earned savings. To-night she was being ""presented to Society"" (whose members had known her since her birth), and all ""Society"" was there.",1
4483,"And from this night on, the girl's smiling face would turn up with monotonous regularity in all the rotogravure sections of the Sunday papers, and daily the nation would be kept posted on all the momentous trivia of her life--what she ate, what she wore, where she went, who went with her, what night clubs had been honoured by her presence, what fortunate young gentleman had been seen accompanying her to what race track, and what benefits she had sponsored and poured tea for. For one whole year, from now until another beautiful and rich young lady from next season's crop of beautiful and rich young ladies was chosen by the newspaper photographers to succeed her as America's leading debutante, this gay and care-free creature would be for Americans very much what a royal princess is for Englishmen, and for very much the same reason--because she was her father's daughter, and because her father was one of the rulers of America. Millions would read about her every move and envy her, and thousands would copy her as far as their means would let them. They would buy cheap imitations of her costly dresses, hats, and underclothes, would smoke the same cigarettes, use the same lipsticks, eat the same soups, sleep on the same mattresses that she had allowed herself to be pictured wearing, smoking, using, eating, and sleeping on in the handsome coloured advertisements on the back covers of magazines--and they would do it, knowing full well that the rich young lady had set these fashions for a price--was she not her father's daughter?--all, of course, for the sake of sweet charity and commerce.",1
4484,"Outside the great hotel, on the Avenue in front of it and on all the side streets in the near vicinity, sleek black limousines were parked. In some of them the chauffeurs slouched dozing behind their wheels. Others had turned on their inside lights and sat there reading the pages of the tabloids. But most of them had left their cars and were knotted together in little groups, smoking, talking, idling the time away until their services should be needed again.",1
4485,"On the pavement near the entrance of the hotel, beside the huge marquee which offered shelter from the wind, the largest group of them, neat in their liveried uniforms, had gathered in debate. They were discussing politics and theories of international economy, and the chief disputants were a plump Frenchman with a waxed moustache, whose sentiments were decidedly revolutionary, and an American, a little man with corky legs, a tough, seamed face, the beady eyes of a bird, and the quick, impatient movements of the city. As George Webber came abreast of them, brought thither by the simple chance of his nightly wanderings, the argument had reached its furious climax, and he stopped a while to listen.",1
4486,"The scene, the situation, and the contrast between the two principal debaters made the whole affair seem utterly grotesque. The plump Frenchman, his cheeks glowing with the cold and his own excitement, was dancing about in a frenzy, talking and gesticulating volubly. He would lean forward with thumb and forefinger uplifted and closed daintily in a descriptive circle--a gesture that eloquently expressed the man's conviction that the case he had been presenting for immediate and bloody world revolution was complete, logical, unshakable, and beyond appeal. When any of the others interposed an objection, he would only grow more violent and inflamed.",1
4487,"At last his little English began to break down under the strain imposed upon it. The air about him fairly rang with objurgations, expletives, impassioned cries of ""Mais oui!...Absolument!... C'est la vérité!""--and with laughs of maddened exasperation, as if the knowledge that anyone could be so obtuse as not to see it as he saw it was more than he could endure.",1
4488,"Mais non! Mais non! he would shout. Vous avez tort!...Mais c'est stupide! he would cry, throwing his plump arms up in a gesture of defeat, and turning away as if he could stand it no longer and was departing--only to return immediately and begin all over again.",1
4489,"Meanwhile, the chief target of this deluge, the little American with the corky legs and the birdy eyes, let him go on. He just leaned up against the building, took an occasional puff at his cigarette, and gave the Frenchman a steady look of cynical impassivity. At last he broke in to say:  ""O.K...",1
4490,"O.K., Frenchy... When you get through spoutin', maybe I'll have somethin' to say. Seulement un mot!"" replied the Frenchman, out of breath.",1
4491,"One vord! he cried impressively, drawing himself up to his full five feet three and holding one finger in the air as if he were about to deliver Holy Writ--""I 'ave to say one vord more!""  ""O.K.! O.K.! said the corky little American with cynical weariness. Only don't take more than an hour and a half to say it!""  Just then another chauffeur, obviously a German, with bright blue eyes and a nut-cracker face, rejoined the group with an air of elated discovery.",1
4492,"Noos! I got noos for you! he said. I haf been mit a drifer who hass in Rooshia liffed, and he says that conditions there far worser are----""  ""Non! Non!",1
4493,"the Frenchman shouted, red in the face with anger and protest. Pas vrai!...Ce n'est par possible!""  ""Oh, for Christ's sake,"" the American said, tossing his cigarette away with a gesture of impatience and disgust. Why don't you guys wake up? This ain't Russia! You're in America! The trouble with you guys,"" he went on, ""is that you've been over there all your life where you ain't been used to nothin'--and just as soon as you get over here where you can live like a human bein' you want to tear it all down. At this, others broke in, and the heated and confused dialogue became more furious than ever.",1
4494,"But the talk just went round and round in circles. George walked away into the night. The lives of men who have to live in our great cities are often tragically lonely. In many more ways than one, these dwellers in the hive are modern counterparts of Tantalus. They are starving to death in the midst of abundance. The crystal stream flows near the lips but always falls away when they try to drink of it. The vine, rich-weighted with its golden fruit, bends down, comes near, but springs back when they reach to touch it.",1
4495,"Melville, at the beginning of his great fable, Moby Dick, tells how the city people of his time would, on every occasion that was afforded them, go down to the dock, to the very edges of the wharf, and stand there looking out to sea. In the great city of to-day, however, there is no sea to look out to, or, if there is, it is so far away, so inaccessible, walled in behind such infinite ramifications of stone and steel, that the effort to get to it is disheartening. So now, when the city man looks out, he looks out on nothing but crowded vacancy.",1
4496,"Does this explain, perhaps, the desolate emptiness of city youth--those straggling bands of boys of sixteen or eighteen that one can always see at night or on a holiday, going along a street, filling the air with raucous jargon and senseless cries, each trying to outdo the others with joyless catcalls and mirthless quips and jokes which are so feeble, so stupidly inane, that one hears them with strong mixed feelings of pity and of shame? Where here, among these lads, is all the merriment, high spirits, and spontaneous gaiety of youth? These creatures, millions of them, seem to have been born but half-made up, without innocence, born old and stale and dull and empty.",1
4497,"Who can wonder at it? For what a world it is that most of them were born into! They were suckled on darkness, and weaned on violence and noise. They had to try to draw out moisture from the cobble-stones, their true parent was a city street, and in that barren universe no urgent sails swelled out and leaned against the wind, they rarely knew the feel of earth beneath their feet and no birds sang, t heir youthful eyes grew hard, unseeing, from being stopped for ever by a wall of masonry.",1
4498,"In other times, when painters tried to paint a scene of awful desolation, they chose the desert or a heath of barren rocks, and there would try to picture man in his great loneliness--the prophet in the desert, Elijah being fed by ravens on the rocks. But for a modern painter, the most desolate scene would be a street in almost any one of our great cities on a Sunday afternoon. Suppose a rather drab and shabby street in Brooklyn, not quite tenement perhaps, and lacking therefore even the gaunt savagery of I overty, but a street of cheap brick buildings, warehouses, and garages, with a cigar store or a fruit stand or a barber shop on the corner. Suppose a Sunday afternoon in March--bleak, empty, slaty grey. And suppose a group of men, Americans of the working class, dressed in t heir ""good"" Sunday clothes--the cheap machine-made suits, the new cheap shoes, the cheap felt hats stamped out of universal grey. Just suppose this, and nothing more. The men hang round the corner before the cigar store or the closed barber shop, and now and then, through the bleak and empty street, a motor-car goes flashing past, and in the distance they hear the cold rumble of an elevated train. For hours they hang round the corner, waiting--waiting--waiting----  For what?  Nothing.",1
4499,"Nothing at all. And that is what gives the scene its special quality of tragic loneliness, awful emptiness, and utter desolation. Every modern city man is familiar with it. And yet--and yet----  It is also true--and this is a curious paradox about America--that these same men who stand upon the corner and wait around on Sunday afternoons for nothing are filled at the same time with an almost quenchless hope, an almost boundless optimism, an almost indestructible belief that something is bound to turn up, something is sure to happen.",1
4500,"This is a peculiar quality of the American soul, and it contributes largely to the strange enigma of our life, which is so incredibly mixed of harshness and of tenderness, of innocence and of crime, of loneliness and of good fellowship, of desolation and of exultant hope, of terror and of courage, of nameless fear and of soaring conviction, of brutal, empty, naked, bleak, corrosive ugliness, and of beauty so lovely and so overwhelming that the tongue is stopped by it, and the language for it has not yet been uttered. How explain this nameless hope that seems to lack all reasonable foundation? I cannot. But if you were to go up to this fairly intelligent-looking truck-driver who stands and waits there with his crowd, and if you put to him your question, and if he understood what you were talking about (he wouldn't), and if he were articulate enough to frame in words the feelings that are in him (he isn't)--he might answer you with something such as this:  ""Now is duh mont' of March, duh mont' of March--now it is Sunday afternoon in Brooklyn in duh mont' of March, an' we stand upon cold corners of duh day.",1
4501,"It's funny dat dere are so many corners in duh mont' of March, here in Brooklyn where no corners are. Jesus! On Sunday in duh mont' of March we sleep late in duh mornin' den we get up an' read duh papers--dub funnies an' duh sportin' news. We eat some chow. An' den we dress up in duh afternoon, we leave our wives, we leave dub funnies littered on duh floor, an' go outside in Brooklyn in duh mont' of March an' stand around upon ten t'ousand corners of duh day. We need a corner in, duh mont' of March, a wall to stand to, a shelter an' a door. Dere must be some place inside in duh mont' of March, but we never found it. So we stand around on corners where duh sky is cold an' ragged still wit' winter, in our good clothes we stand around wit' a lot of udder guys we know, before dub, barber shop, just lookin' for a door. Ah, yes, for in summer:  It is so cool and sweet to-night, a million feet are walking here across the jungle web of Brooklyn in the dark, and it's so hard now to remember that it ever was the month of March in Brooklyn and that we couldn't find a door.",1
4502,"There are so many million doors tonight. There's a door for everyone to-night, all's open to the air , all's interfused to-night: remote the thunder of the elevated trains on Fulton Street, the rattling of the cars along Atlantic Avenue, the glare of Coney Island seven miles away, the mob, the racket, and the barkers shouting, the cars swift-shuttling through the quiet streets, the people swarming in the web, lit here and there with livid blurs of light, the voices of the neighbours leaning at their windows, harsh, soft, all interfused. All's illusive in the liquid air to-night, all mixed in with the radios that blare from open windows. And there is something over all to-night, something fused, remote, and trembling, made of all of this, and yet not of it, upon the huge and weaving ocean of the night in Brooklyn--something that we had almost quite forgotten in the month of March. What's this?--a sash raised gently?--a window?--a near voice on the air?--something swift and passing, almost captured, there below?--there in the gulf of night the mournful and yet thrilling voices of the tugs?--the liner's blare? Herethere--some otherwhere--was it a whisper?--a woman's call?--a sound of people talking behind the screens and doors in Flatbush? It trembles in the air throughout the giant web to-night, as fleeting as a step--near--as soft and sudden as a woman's laugh. The liquid air is living with the very whisper of the thing that we are looking for to-night throughout America--the very thing that seemed so bleak, so vast, so cold, so hopeless, and so lost as we waited in out good clothes on ten thousand corners of the day in Brooklyn in the month of March.",1
4503,"If George Webber had never gone beyond the limits of the neighbourhood in which he lived, the whole chronicle of the earth would have been there for him just the same. South Brooklyn was a universe. The people in the houses all round him, whose lives in the cold, raw days of winter always seemed hermetic, sterile, and remote, as shut out from him as though they were something sealed up in a tin, became in spring and summer so real to him it seemed that he had known them from his birth. For, as the days and nights grew warmer, everybody kept their windows open, and all the dwellers in these houses conducted their most intimate affairs in loud and raucous voices which carried to the street and made the casual passer-by a confidant of every family secret.",1
4504,"God knows he saw squalor and filth and misery and despair enough, violence and cruelty and hate enough, to crust his lips for ever with the hard and acrid taste of desolation. He found a sinister and demented Italian grocer whose thin mouth writhed in a servile smile as he cringed before his customers, and the next moment was twisted in a savage snarl as he dug his clawlike fingers into the arm of his wretched little son. And on Saturdays the Irishmen would come home drunk, and then would beat their wives and cut one another's throats, and the whole course and progress of their murderous rages would be published nakedly from their open windows with laugh, shout, scream, and curse.",1
4505,"But he found beauty in South Brooklyn, too. There was a tree that leaned over into the narrow alley where he lived, and George could stand at his basement window and look up at it and watch it day by day as it came into its moment's glory of young and magic green. And then towards sunset, if he was tired, he could lie down to rest awhile upon his iron bed and listen to the dying birdsong in the tree. Thus, each spring, in that one tree, he found all April and the earth. He also found devotion, love, and wisdom in a shabby little Jewish tailor and his wife, whose dirty children were always tumbling in and out of the dingy suffocation of his shop.",1
4506,"In the infinite variety of such common, accidental, oft-unheeded things one can see the web of life as it is spun. Whether we wake at morning in the city, or lie at night in darkness in the country towns, or walk the streets of furious noon in all the dusty, homely, and enduring lights of present time, the universe round us is the same. Evil lives for ever--so does good. Man alone has knowledge of these two, and he is such a little thing.",1
4507,"For what is man?  First, a child, soft-boned, unable to support itself on its rubbery legs, befouled with its excrement, that howls and laughs by turns, cries for the moon but hushes when it gets its mother's teat; a sleeper, eater, guzzler, howler, laugher, idiot, and a chewer of its toe; a little tender thing all blubbered with its spit, a reacher into fires, a beloved fool. After that, a boy, hoarse and loud before his companions, but afraid of the dark; will beat the weaker and avoid the stronger; worships strength and savagery, loves tales of war and murder, and violence done to others; joins gangs and hates to be alone; makes heroes out of soldiers, sailors, prize-fighters, football players, cowboys, gunmen, and detectives; would rather die than not out-try and out-dare his companions, wants to beat them and always to win, shows his muscle and demands that it be felt, boasts of his victories and will never own defeat. Then the youth: goes after girls, is foul behind their backs among the drug-store boys, hints at a hundred seductions, but gets pimples on his face; begins to think about his clothes, becomes a fop, greases his hair, smokes cigarettes with a dissipated air, reads novels, and writes poetry on the sly. He sees the world now as a pair of legs and breasts; he knows hate, love, and jealousy; he is cowardly and foolish, he cannot endure to be alone; he lives in a crowd, thinks with the crowd, is afraid to be marked off from his fellows by an eccentricity. He joins clubs and is afraid of ridicule; he is bored and unhappy and wretched most of the time. There is a great cavity in him, he is dull.",1
4508,"Then the man: he is busy, he is full of plans and reasons, he has work. He gets children, buys and sells small packets of everlasting earth, intrigues against his rivals, is exultant when he cheats them. He wastes his little three score years and ten in spendthrift and ingloriousliving; from his cradle to his grave he scarcely sees the sun or moon or stars; he is unconscious of the immortal sea and earth; he talks of he future and he wastes it as it comes. If he is lucky, he saves money. At the end his fat purse buys him flunkeys to carry him where his shanks no longer can; he consumes rich food and golden wine that his wretched stomach has no hunger for; his weary and lifeless eyeslook out upon the scenery of strange lands for which in youth his heart was panting. Then the slow death, prolonged by costly doctors, and finally the graduate undertakers, the perfumed carrion, the suave ushers with palms outspread to leftwards, the fast motor hearses, and the earth again.",1
4509,"This is man: a writer of books, a putter-down of words, a painter of pictures, a maker of ten thousand philosophies. He grows passion-site over ideas, he hurls scorn and mockery at another's work, he finds the one way, the true way, for himself, and calls all others false--yet in the billion books upon the shelves there is not one that can tell him how to draw a single fleeting breath in peace and comfort. He makes histories of the universe, he directs the destiny of nations, but he does not know his own history, and he cannot direct his own destiny with dignity or wisdom for ten consecutive minutes.",1
4510,"This is man: for the most part a foul, wretched, abominable creature, a packet of decay, a bundle of degenerating tissues, a creature that gets old and hairless and has a foul breath, a hater of his kind, a cheater, a scorner, a mocker, a reviler, a thing that kills and murders in a mob or in the dark, loud and full of brag surrounded by his fellows, but without the courage of a rat alone. He will cringe for a coin, and show his snarling fangs behind the giver's back; he will cheat for two sous, and kill for forty dollars, and weep copiously in court to keep another scoundrel out of jail. This is man, who will steal his friend's woman, feel the leg of his host's wife below the table-cloth, dump fortunes on his whores, bow down in worship before charlatans, and let his poets die. This is man, who swears he will live only for beauty, for art, for the spirit, but will live only for fashion, and will change his faith and his convictions as soon as fashion changes. This is man, the great warrior with the flaccid gut, the great romantic with the barren loins, the eternal knave devouring the eternal fool, the most glorious of all the animals, who uses his brain for the most part to make himself a stench in the nostrils of the Bull, the Fox, the Dog, the Tiger, and the Goat.",1
4511,"Yes, this is man, and it is impossible to say the worst of him, for the record of his obscene existence, his baseness, lust, cruelty, and treachery, is illimitable. His life is also full of toil, tumult, and suffering. His days are mainly composed of a million idiot, repetitions--in goings and comings along hot streets, in sweatings and freezings, in the senseless accumulation of fruitless tasks, in decaying and being patched, in grinding out his life so that he may buy bad food, in eating bad food so that he may grind his life out in distressful defecations. He is the dweller in that ruined tenement who, from one moment's breathing to another, can hardly forget the bitter weight of his uneasy flesh, the thousand diseases and distresses of his body, the growing incubus of his corruption. This is man, who, if he can remember ten golden moments of joy and happiness out of all his years, ten moments unmarked by care, unseamed by aches or itches, has power to lift himself with his expiring breath and say: ""I have lived upon this earth and known glory! This is man, and one wonders why he wants to live at all.",1
4512,"A third of his life is lost and deadened under sleep; another third is given to a sterile labour; a sixth is spent in all his goings and his comings, in the moil and shuffle of the streets, in thrusting, shoving, pawing. How much of him is left, then, for a vision of the tragic stars? How much of him is left to look upon the everlasting earth? How much of him is left for glory and the making of great songs? A few snatched moments only from the barren glut and suck of living.",1
4513,"Here, then, is man, this moth of time, this dupe of brevity and numbered hours, this travesty of waste and sterile breath. Yet if the gods could come here to a desolate, deserted earth where only the ruin of man's cities remained, where only a few marks and carvings of his hand were legible upon his broken tablets, where only a wheel lay rusting in the desert sand, a cry would burst out of their hearts and they would say: ""He lived, and he was here!""  Behold his works:  He needed speech to ask for bread--and he had Christ! He needed songs to sing in battle--and he had Homer! He needed words to curse his enemies--and he had Dante, he had Voltaire, he had Swift! He needed cloth to cover up his hairless, puny flesh against the seasons--and he wove the robes of Solomon, he made the garments of great kings, he made the samite for the young knights! He needed walls and a roof to shelter him--and he made Blois! He needed a temple to propitiate his God--and he made Chartres and Fountains Abbey! He was born to creep upon the earth--and he made great wheels, he sent great engines thundering down the rails, he launched great wings into the air, he put great ships upon the angry sea!",1
4514,"Plagues wasted him, and cruel wars destroyed his strongest sons, but fire, flood, and famine could not quench him. No, nor the inexorable grave--his sons leaped shouting from his dying loins. The shaggy bison with his thews of thunder died upon the plains; the fabled mammoths of the unrecorded ages are vast scaffoldings of dry, insensate loam; the panthers have learned caution and move carefully among tall grasses to the water-hole; and man lives on amid the senseless nihilism of the universe.",1
4515,"For there is one belief, one faith, that is man's glory, his triumph, his immortality--and that is his belief in life. Man loves life, and, loving life, hates death, and because of this he is great, he is glorious, he is beautiful, and his beauty is everlasting. He lives below the senseless stars and writes his meanings in them. He lives in fear, in toil, in agony, and in unending tumult, but if the blood foamed bubbling from his wounded lungs at every breath he drew, he would still love life more dearly than an end of breathing. Dying, his eyes burn beautifully, and the old hunger shines more fiercely in them--he has endured all the hard and purposeless suffering, and still he wants to live.",1
4516,"Thus it is impossible to scorn this creature. For out of his strong belief in life, this puny man made love. At his best, he is love. Without him there can be no love, no hunger, no desire.",1
4517,"So this is man--the worst and best of him--this frail and petty thing who lives his day and dies like-all the other animals, and is forgotten. And yet, he is immortal, too, for both the good and evil that he does live after him. Why, then, should any living man ally himself with death, and, in his greed and blindness, batten on his brother's blood?  28.",1
4518,"The Fox During all these desperate years in Brooklyn, when George lived and worked alone, he had only one real friend, and this was his editor, Foxhall Edwards. They spent many hours together, wonderful hours of endless talk, so free and full that it combed the universe and bound the two of them together in bonds of closest friendship. It was a friendship founded on many common tastes and interests, on mutual liking and admiration of each for what the other was, and on an attitude of respect which allowed unhampered expression of opinion even on those rare subjects which aroused differences of views and of belief. It was, therefore, the kind of friendship that can exist only between two men. It had in it no element of that possessiveness which always threatens a woman's relations with a man, no element of that physical and emotional involvement which, while it serves nature's end of bringing a man and woman together, also tends to thwart their own dearest wish to remain so by throwing over their companionship a constricting cloak of duty and obligation, of right' and vested interest.",1
4519,"The older man was not merely friend but father to the younger. Webber, the hot-blooded Southerner, with his large capacity for sentiment and affection, had lost his own father many years before and now had found a substitute in Edwards. And Edwards, the reserved New Englander, with his deep sense of family and inheritance, had always wanted a son but had had five daughters, and as time went on he made of George a kind of foster son. Thus each, without quite knowing that he did it, performed an act of spiritual adoption.",1
4520,"So it was to Foxhall Edwards that George now turned whenever his loneliness became unbearable. When his inner turmoil, confusion, and self-doubts overwhelmed him, as they often did, and his life went dead and stale and empty till it sometimes seemed that all the barren desolation of the Brooklyn streets had soaked into his very blood and marrow--then he would seek out Edwards. And he never went to him in vain. Edwards, busy though he always was, would drop whatever he was doing and would take George out to lunch or dinner, and in his quiet, casual, oblique, and understanding way would talk to him and draw him out until he found out what it was that troubled him. And always in the end, because of Edward's faith in him, George would be healed and find himself miraculously restored to self-belief.",1
4521,"What manner of man was this great editor and father-confessor and true friend--he of the quiet, shy, sensitive, and courageous heart who often seemed to those who did not know him well an eccentric, cold, indifferent fellow--he who, grandly christened Foxhall, preferred to be the simple, unassuming Fox? The Fox asleep was a breathing portrait of guileless innocence. He slept on his right side, legs doubled up a little, hands folded together underneath the ear, his hat beside him on the pillow. Seen so, the sleeping figure of the Fox was touching--for all his five and forty years, it was so plainly boylike. By no stretch of fancy the old hat beside him on the pillow might have been a childish toy brought to bed with him the night before--and this, in fact, it was!",1
4522,"It was as if, in sleep, no other part of Fox was left except the boy. Sleep seemed to have resumed into itself this kernel of his life, to have excluded all transitions, to have brought the man back to his acorn, keeping thus inviolate that which the man, indeed, had never lost, but which had passed through change and time and all the accretions of experience--and now had been restored, unwoven back into the single oneness of itself. And yet it was a guileful Fox, withal. Oh, guileful Fox, how innocent in guilefulness and in innocence how full of guile! How straight in cunning, and how cunning-straight, in all directions how strange-devious, in all strange-deviousness how direct! Too straight for crookedness, and for envy too serene, too fair for blind intolerance, too just and seeing and too strong for hate, too honest for base dealing, too high for low suspiciousness, too innocent for all the scheming tricks of swarming villainy--yet never had been taken in a horse trade yet!",1
4523,"So, then, life's boy is he, life's trustful child; life's guileful-guileless Fox is he, but not life's angel, not life's fool. Will get at all things like a fox--not full-tilt at the fences, not head-on, but through coverts peering, running at fringes of the wood, or by the wall; will swing round on the pack and get behind the hounds, cross them up and be away and gone when they are looking for him where he's not--he will not mean to fox them, but he will. Gets round the edges of all things the way a fox does. Never takes the main route or the worn handle. Sees the worn handle, what it is, says: ""Oh,"" but knows it's not right handle though most used: gets right handle right away and uses it. No one knows how it is done, neither knows the Fox, but does it instantly. It seems so easy when Fox does it, easy as a shoe, because he has had it from his birth. It is a genius.",1
4524,"Our Fox is never hard or fancy, always plain. He makes all plays look easy, never brilliant; it seems that anyone can do it when Fox does it. He covers more ground than any other player in the game, yet does not seem to do so. His style is never mannered, seems no style at all; the thrilled populace never holds its breath in hard suspense when he takes aim, because no one ever saw the Fox take aim, and yet he never misses. Others spend their lives in learning to take aim: they wear just the proper uniform for taking aim, they advance in good order, they signal to the breathless world for silence--""We are taking aim! they say, and then with faultless style and form, with flawless execution, they bring up their pieces, take aim--and miss! The great Fox never seems to take aim, and never misses. Why? He was just born that way--fortunate, a child of genius, innocent and simple--and a Fox!",1
4525,"And ah!--a cunning Fox! the Aimers and the Missers say. A damned subtle, devilish, and most cunning Fox! they cry, and grind their teeth. Be not deceived by his appearance--'tis a cunning Fox! Put not your faith in Foxes, put not your faith in this one, he will look so shy, and seem so guileless and so bewildered--but he will never miss!",1
4526,"But how""--the Aimers and the Missers plead with one another in exasperation--""how does he do it? What has the fellow got? He's nothing much to look at--nothing much to talk to. He makes no appearance! He never goes out in the world--you never see him at receptions, parties, splendid entertainments--he makes no effort to meet people--no, or to talk to them! He hardly talks at all!... What has he got? Where does it come from? Is it chance or luck? There is some mystery----""  ""Well, now,"" says one, ""I'll tell you what my theory is----""  Their heads come close, they whisper craftily together until----  ""No!"" another cries.",1
4527,"It is not that. I tell you what he does, it's----""  And again they whisper close, argue and deny, get more confused than ever, and finally are reduced to furious impotence:  ""Bah!"" cries one. How does the fellow do it, anyway? How does he get away with it? He seems to have no sense, no knowledge, no experience. He doesn't get round the way we do, lay snares and traps. He doesn't seem to know what's going on, or what the whole thing's all about--and yet----""  ""He's just a snob!",1
4528,"another snarls. When you try to be a good fellow, he high-hats you! You try to kid him, he just looks at you! He never offers to shake hands with you, he never slaps you on the back the way real fellows do! You go out of your way to be nice to him--to show him you're a real guy and that you think he is, too--and what does he do? He just looks at you with that funny little grin and turns away--and wears that damned hat in the office all day long--I think he sleeps with it! He never asks you to sit down--and gets up while you're talking to him--leaves you cold--begins to wander up and down outside, staring at everyone he sees--his own associates--as if he were some half-wit idiot boy--and wanders back into his office twenty minutes later--stares at you as if he never saw your face before--and jams that damned hat farther down round his ears, and turns away--takes hold of his lapels--looks out the window with that crazy grin--then looks at you again, looks you up and down, stares at your face until you wonder if you've changed suddenly into a baboon--and turns back to the window without a word--then stares at you again--finally pretends to recognise you, and says: 'Oh, it's you!'... I tell you he's a snob, and that's his way of letting you know you don't belong! Oh, I know about him--I know what he is! He's an old New Englander--older than God, by God! Too good for anyone but God, by God!--and even God's a little doubtful! An aristocrat--a rich man's son--a Groton-Harvard boy--too fine for the likes of us, by God!--too good for the 'low bounders' who make up this profession! He thinks we're a bunch of business men and Babbitts--and that's the reason that he looks at us the way he does--that's the reason that he grins his grin, and turns away, and catches at his coat lapels, and doesn't answer when you speak to him--""  ""Oh, no,"" another quickly interrupts.",1
4529,"You're wrong there! The reason that he grins that grin and turns away is that he's trying hard to hear--the reason that he doesn't answer when you speak to him is that he's deaf----""  ""Ah, deaf! says still another in derision. Deaf, hell! Deaf as a Fox, he is! That deafness is a stall--a trick--a gag! He hears you when he wants to hear you! If it's anything he wants to hear, he'll hear you though you're forty yards away and talking in a whisper! He's a Fox, I tell you!""  ""Yes, a Fox, a Fox!",1
4530,"they chorus in agreement. That much is certain--the man's a Fox! So the Aimers and the Missers whisper, argue, and deduce. They lay siege to intimates and friends of Fox, ply them with flattery and strong drink, trying thus to pluck out the heart of Fox's mystery. They find out nothing, because there's nothing to find out, nothing anyone can tell them. They are reduced at length to exasperated bafflement and finish where they started. They advance to their positions, take aim--and miss!",1
4531,"And so, in all their ways, they lay cunning snares throughout the coverts of the city. They lay siege to life. They think out tactics, crafty stratagems. They devise deep plans to bag the game. They complete masterly flanking operations in the night-time (while the great Fox sleeps), get in behind the enemy when he isn't looking, are sure that victory is within their grasp, take aim magnificently--and fire--and shoot one another painfully in the seats of their expensive pants!",1
4532,"Meanwhile, the Fox is sleeping soundly through the night, as sweetly as a child. Night passes, dawn comes, eight o'clock arrives. How to describe him now as he awakes?",1
4533,"A man of five and forty years, not really seeming younger, yet always seeming something of the boy. Rather, the boy is there within that frame of face, behind the eyes, within the tenement of flesh and bone--not imprisoned, just held there in a frame--a frame a little worn by the years, webbed with small wrinkles round the eyes--invincibly the same as it has always been. The hair, once fair and blond, no longer fair and blond now, feathered at the temples with a touch of grey, elsewhere darkened by time and weather to a kind of steel-grey--blondness really almost dark now, yet, somehow, still suggesting fair and blond. The head well set and small, boy's head still, the hair sticking thick and close to it, growing to a V in the centre of the forehead, then back straight and shapely, full of natural grace. Eyes pale blue, full of a strange misty light, a kind of far weather of the sea in them, eyes of a New England sailor long months outbound for China on a clipper ship, with something drowned, sea-sunken in them.",1
4534,"The general frame and structure of the face is somewhat lean and long and narrow--face of the ancestors, a bred face, face of people who have looked the same for generations. A stern, lonely face, with the enduring fortitude of granite, face of the New England seacoast, really his grandfather's face, New England statesman's face, whose bust sits there on the mantel, looking at the bed. Yet something else has happened on Fox's face to transfigure it from the primeval nakedness of granite: in its essential framework, granite still, but a kind of radiance and warmth of life has enriched and mellowed it. A light is burning in the Fox, shining outwards through the face, through every gesture, grace, and movement of the body, 'something swift, mercurial, mutable, and tender, something buried and withheld, but passionate--something out of his mother's face, perhaps,' or out of his father's or his father's mother's--something that subdues the granite with warmth--something from poetry, intuition, genius, imagination, living, inner radiance, and beauty. This face, then, with the shapely head, the pale, far-misted vision of the eyes, held in round bony cages like a bird's, the strong, straight nose, curved at the end, a little scornful and patrician, sensitive, sniffing, swift-nostriled as a hound's--the whole face with its passionate and proud serenity might almost be the face of a great poet, or the visage of some strange and mighty bird.",1
4535,"But now the sleeping figure stirs, opens its eyes and listens, rouses, starts up like a flash. What?"" says Fox. The Fox awake now.",1
4536,"FOXHALL MORTON EDWARDS. The great name chanted slowly through his brain--someone had surely spoken it--it filled his ears with sound--it rang down solemnly through the aisles of consciousness--it was no dream--the very walls were singing with its grave and proud sonorities as he awoke. What?"" cried Fox again.",1
4537,"He looked about him. There was no one there. He shook his head as people do when they shake water from their ears. He inclined his good right ear and listened for the sound again. He tugged and rubbed his good right ear--yes, it was unmistakable--the good right ear was ringing with the sound.",1
4538,"Fox looked bewildered, puzzled, searched round the room again with sea-pale eyes, saw nothing, saw his hat beside him on the pillow, said, ""Oh,"" in a slightly puzzled tone, picked up the hat and jammed it on his head, half-covering the ears, swung out of bed and thrust his feet into his slippers, got up, pyjamaed and behatted, walked over to the door, opened it, looked out, and said:  ""What? Is anybody there?--Oh! For there was nothing--just the hall, the quiet, narrow hall of morning, the closed door of his wife's room, and the stairs.",1
4539,"He closed the door, turned back into his room, still looking puzzled, intently listening, his good right ear half-turned and searching for the sounds. Where had they come from then? The name--he thought he heard it still, faintly now, mixed in with many other strange, confusing noises. But where? From, what direction did they come? Or had he heard them? A long, droning sound, like an electric fan--perhaps a motor in the street? A low, retreating thunder--an elevated train, perhaps? A fly buzzing? Or a mosquito with its whining bore? No, it could not be: it was morning, spring-time, and the month of May.",1
4540,"Light winds of morning fanned the curtains of his pleasant room. An old four-poster bed, a homely, gay old patch-quilt coverlet, an old chest of drawers, a little table by his bed, piled high with manuscripts, a glass of water and his eyeglasses, and a little ticking clock. Was that what he had heard? He held it to his ear and listened. On the mantel, facing him, the bust of his grandfather, Senator William Fox-hall Morton, far-seeing, sightless, stern, lean, shrewd with decision; a chair or two, and on the wall an engraving of Michelangelo's great Lorenzo Medici. Fox looked at it and smiled.",1
4541,"A man,"" said he in a low voice. The way a man should look! The figure of the young Caesar was mighty-limbed, enthroned; helmeted for war; the fine hand half-supporting the chin of the grand head, broodingly aware of great events and destiny; thought knit to action, poetry to fact, caution to boldness, reflection to decision--the Thinker, Warrior, Statesman, Ruler all conjoined in one. And what a man should be,"" thought Fox.",1
4542,"A little puzzled still, Fox goes to his window and looks out, pyjamaed and behatted still, the fingers of one hand back upon his hips, a movement lithe and natural as a boy's. The head goes back, swift nostrils sniff, dilate with scorn. Light winds of morning fan him, gauzy curtains are blown back.",1
4543,"And outside, morning, and below him, morning, sky-shining morning all above, below, around, across from him, cool-slanting morning, gold-cool morning, and the street. Black fronts of rusty brown across from him, the flat fronts of Turtle Bay. Fox looks at morning and the street with sea-pale eyes, as if he never yet had seen them, then in a low and husky voice, a little hoarse, agreeable, half-touched with whisper, he says with slow recognition, quiet wonder, and--somehow, somewby--resignation:",1
4544,"Oh...I see. Turns now and goes into his bathroom opposite, surveys himself in the mirror with the same puzzled, grave, and sea-pale wonder, looks at his features, notes the round cages that enclose his eyes, sees Boy-Fox staring gravely out at him, bethinks him suddenly of Boy-Fox's ear, which stuck out at right angles forty years ago, getting Boy-Fox gibes at Groton--so jams hat farther down about the ear, so stick-out ear that's stick-out ear no longer won't stick out! So standing, he surveys himself for several moments, and finding out at length that this indeed is he, says, as before, with the same slightly puzzled, slow, and patiently resigned acceptance:",1
4545,Oh. I see. Turns on the shower faucet now--the water spurts and hisses in jets of smoking steam.,1
4546,"Fox starts to step beneath the shower, suddenly observes pyjamas on his person, mutters slowly--""Oh-h!""--and takes them off. Unpyjamaed now, and as God made him, save for hat, starts to get in under shower with hat on--and remembers hat, remembers it in high confusion, is forced against his will to acknowledge the unwisdom of the procedure--so snaps his fingers angrily, and, in a low, disgusted tone of acquiescence, says: Oh, well, then! All right!",1
4547,"So removes his hat, which is now jammed on so tightly that he has to take both hands and fairly wrench and tug his way out of it, hangs the battered hulk reluctantly within easy reaching distance on a hook upon the door, surveys it for a moment with an undecided air, as if still not willing to relinquish it--and then, still with a puzzled air, steps in beneath those hissing jets of water hot enough to boil an egg! Puzzled no longer, my mad masters, ye may take it, Fox comes out on the double-quick, and loudly utters: ""Damn!""--and fumes and dances, snaps his fingers, loudly utters ""Damn! again-- but gets his water tempered to his hide this time, and so, without more peradventure, takes his shower.",1
4548,"Shower done, hair brushed at once straight back around his well-shaped head, on goes the hat at once. So brushes teeth, shaves with a safety razor, walks out naked but behatted into his room, starts to go downstairs, remembers clothing--""Oh!""--looks round, bepuzzled, sees clothing spread out neatly on a chair by womenfolks the night before--fresh socks, fresh underwear, a clean shirt, a suit, a pair of shoes. Fox never knows where they come from, wouldn't know where to look, is always slightly astonished when he finds them. Says ""Oh! again, goes back and puts clothes on, and finds to his amazement that they fit.",1
4549,"They fit him beautifully. Everything fits the Fox. He never knows what he has on, but he could wear a tow-sack, or a shroud, a sail, a length of canvas--they would fit the moment that he put them on, and be as well the elegance of faultless style. His clothes just seem to grow on him: whatever he wears takes on at once the grace, the dignity, and the unconscious ease of his own person. Never exercises much, but never has to; loves to take a walk, is bored by games and plays none; has same figure that he had at twenty-one--five feet ten, one hundred and fifty pounds, no belly and no fat, the figure of a boy.",1
4550,"Dressed now, except for necktie, picks up necktie, suddenly observes it, a very gay one with blue polka dots, and drops it with dilating nostrils, muttering a single word that seems to utter volumes: Women!""  Then searches vaguely on a tie rack in his closet, finds a modest grey cravat, and puts it on. So, attired now, picks up a manuscript, his pince-nez glasses, opens the door, and walks out in the narrow hall.",1
4551,"His wife's door closed and full of sleep, the air touched subtly with a faint perfume. The Fox sniffs sharply, with a swift upward movement of his head, and, looking with scorn, mixed with compassion, pity, tenderness, and resignation, inclines his head in one slow downward movement of decision, and says:  ""Women! So, down the narrow, winding staircase now, his head thrown sharply back, one hand upon his lapel, the other holding manuscript, and reaches second floor. Another narrow hall. Front, back and to the side, three more closed doors of sleep and morning, and five daughters----  ""Women!""  Surveys the door of Martha, the oldest, twenty, a----  Woman!",1
4552,"And next the door of Eleanor, aged eighteen, and Amelia, just sixteen, but----  Women! And finally, with a gentle scorn, touched faintly with a smile, the door of the two youngest, Ruth, fourteen, little Ann, just seven, yet----  Women! So, sniffing sharply the woman-laden air, descends now to the first floor, enters living-room, and scornfully surveys the work of----  Women!",1
4553,"The carpets are rolled up, the morning sunlight slants on the bare boards. The chairs, the sofas, and upholstery have been ripped open, the stuffing taken out. The place smells of fresh paint. The walls, brown yesterday, are robin's-egg blue this morning. Buckets of paint are scattered round the floor. Even the books that lined the walls have been taken from the tall, indented shelves. The interior decorators are at their desperate work again, and all because of----  Women!",1
4554,"Fox sniffs the fresh paint with sharp disgust, crosses the room, mounts winding steps, which also have been painted robin's-egg blue, and goes out on the terrace. Gay chairs and swings and tables, gay-striped awnings, and in an ash-tray several cigarette-butts with tell-tale prints upon them----  Women! The garden backs of Turtle Bay are lyrical with tender green, with birdsong and the hidden plash of water--the living secret of elves' magic embedded in the heart of the gigantic city--and beyond, like some sheer, terrific curtain of upward-curving smoke, the frontal cliff of the sky-waving towers.",1
4555,"Fox sniffs sharply the clean green fragrance of the morning, sea-pale eyes are filled with wonder, strangeness, recognition. Something passionate and far transforms his face--and something rubs against his leg, moans softly. Fox looks down into the melancholy, pleading eyes of the French poodle. He observes the ridiculous barbering of the creature--the fuzzy muff of kinky wool around the shoulders, neck, and head, the skinned nakedness of ribs and loins, wool-fuzzy tail again, tall, skinny legs--a half-dressed female creature with no wool at all just where the wool is needed most--no dog at all, but just a frenchified parody of dog--an absurd travesty of all the silly fashions, mannerisms, conquettishness, and irresponsibility of a----  Woman!",1
4556,"Fox turns in disgust, leaves terrace, descends steps to the living-room again, traverses barren boards, threads way round the disembowelled furnishings, and descends the stairs to the basement floor. What's this?""  In entrance hall below, a lavish crimson carpet where yesterday there was a blue one, cream-white paint all over walls to-day, which yesterday were green, the wall all chiselled into, a great sheet of mirror ready to be installed where yesterday no mirror was. Fox traverses narrow hallway, past the kitchen, through the cloakroom--this, too, redolent of fresh paint--and into little cubbyhole that had no use before.",1
4557,"Good God, what's this?""  Transfigured now to Fox's ""cosy den"" (Fox wants no ""cosy den""--will have none!) , walls are painted, bookshelves built, a reading lamp and easy chairs in place, the Fox's favourite books (Fox groans!) transplanted from their shelves upstairs and brought down here where Fox can never find them.",1
4558,"Fox bumps his head against the low doorway in going out, traverses narrow hall again, at last gets into dining-room. Seats himself at head of the long table (six women make a long table!), looks at the glass of orange juice upon his plate, does nothing to it, makes no motion towards it, just sits there waiting in a state of patient and resigned dejection, as who should say: ""It's no one but the Old Grey Mule. Portia enters--a plump mulatto, nearing fifty, tinged so imperceptibly with yellow that she is almost white.",1
4559,"She enters, stops, stares at Fox sitting motionless there, and titters coyly. Fox turns slowly, catches his coat lapels, and looks at her in blank astonishment. She drops her eyelids shyly, tittering, and spreads plump fingers over her fat mouth. Fox surveys her steadily, as if trying to peer through her fingers at her face, then with a kind of no-hope expression in his eyes, he says slowly, in a sepulchral tone:  ""Fruit salad.",1
4560,"And Portia, anxiously:  ""What fo' you doesn't drink yo' orange juice, Mistah Edwands? Doesn't you like it?""  ""Fruit salad,"" repeats Fox tonelessly.",1
4561,"What fo' you always eat dat ole fruit salad, Mistah Edwahds? What fo' you wants dat ole canned stuff when we fixes you de nice fresh orange juice?""  ""Fruit salad,"" echoes Fox dolefully, utter resignation in his tone. Portia departs protesting, but presently fruit salad is produced and put before him. Fox eats it, then looks round and up at Portia, and, still with no-hope resignation in his voice, says low and hoarsely:  ""Is that--all?""  ""Why, no suh, Mistah, Edwahds,"" Portia replies.",1
4562,"You can have anything you likes if you jest lets us know. We nevah knows jest what you's goin' to awdah. All las' month you awdahed fish fo' brek-fus'--is dat what you wants? Breast of guinea-hen,"" says Fox tonelessly.",1
4563,"Why, Mistah Edwahds!"" Portia squeals. Breas' of guinea-hen fo' brek-fus'?""  ""Yes,"" says Fox, patient and enduring. But, Mistah Edwahds! Portia protests. You know you doesn't want breas' of guinea-hen fo' brek-fus'!""  ""Yes,"" says Fox in his hopeless tone, ""I do.",1
4564,"And he regards her steadily with sea-misted eyes, with proud and scornful features, eloquent with patient and enduring bitterness as if to say: ""Man is born of woman and is made to mourn. But Mistah Edwahds,"" Portia pleads with him, ""fokes don't eat breas' of guinea-hen fo' brek-fus'! Dey eats ham an' aiggs, an' toast an' bacon--things like dat. Fox continues to regard her fixedly.",1
4565,"Breast of guinea-hen,"" he says wearily, implacably as before. B-b-b-but, Mistah Edwahds,"" Portia stammers, thoroughly demoralised by this time, ""we ain't got no breas' of guinea-hen. We had some night before last,"" says Fox.",1
4566,"Yes, suh, yes, suh! Portia almost tearfully agrees. But dat's all gone! We et up all dere was!... Besides, you been eatin' breas' of guinea-hen ev'ry night fo' dinnah de las' two weeks, an' Miz Edwands--she say you had enough--she say de chillun gettin' tired of it--she tol' us to get somep'n else! ... If you tol' us dat you wanted guinea-hen fo' brek-fus', we'd a-had it. But you nevah tol' us, Mista Edwahds. Portia is on the verge of open tears by now. You nevah tells us what you wants--an' dat's why we nevah knows. One time you wanted cream chicken fo' yo' brek-fus' ev'ry mawnin' fo' a month... Den you changed roun' to codfish balls, an' had dat fo' a long, long time... An' now it's guinea-hen,"" she almost sobs--""an' we ain't got none, Mistah Edwahds. You nevah tol' us what you wanted. We got ham an' aiggs--we got bacon--we got--"",  ""Oh, well,"" says Fox wearily, ""bring what you have, then--anything you like.",1
4567,"He turns away full of patient scorn, enduring and unhoping bitterness--and ""aiggs"" are brought him. Fox eats them with relish; toast, too, three brown slices, buttered; and drinks two cups of strong hot coffee. Just at half-past eight something entered the dining-room as swift and soundless as a ray of light. It was a child of fourteen years, a creature of surpassing loveliness, the fourth daughter of the Fox, named Ruth. It was the Fox in miniature: a little creature, graceful as a bird, framed finely as some small and perfect animal. The small, lean head was shaped and set exactly as the head of Fox, the dark blonde hair grew cleanly to it, the child's face was of an ivory transparency, the features and the sensitivity of expression were identical with those of Fox, transformed to femininity, and the lines of the whole face were cut and moulded with the exquisite delicacy of a cameo.",1
4568,"The shyness of this little girl was agonising; it was akin to terror. She entered the room breathlessly, noiselessly, stricken, with her head lowered, her arms held to her side, her eyes fixed on the floor. The ordeal of passing by her father, and of speaking to him, was obviously a desperate one; she glided past as if she almost hoped to escape notice. Without raising her eyes, she said: ""Good morning, daddy,"" in a timid little voice, and was about to duck into her chair, when Fox looked up startled, got up quickly, put his arms round her, and kissed her. In answer to his kiss, she pecked her cheek towards him like a bird, still keeping her eyes desperately on the floor.",1
4569,"The face of Fox was illuminated by a radiant tenderness as, in a low, deaf, slightly hoarse tone, he said:  ""Good morning, darling. Still without looking at him, stricken, desperate, she tried to get away from him, yet, even in the act, her affection for the Fox was eloquent. Her heart was beating like a trip-hammer, her eyes went back and forth like a frightened fledgling's, she wanted to vanish through the walls, dart out of doors, turn into a shadow--anything, anything, if only she could utterly escape notice, having no one look at her, pay any attention to her, above all, speak to her. So she fluttered there in his embrace like a dove caught in a snare, tried to get away from him, was in a state of agony so acute and sensitive that it was painful to watch her or to do anything that would in any way increase the embarrassment and desperate shyness of this stricken little girl.",1
4570,"Fox's embrace tightened round her as she tried to escape, and he grew full of solicitude and anxiety as he looked at her. Darling! he whispered, in a low and troubled tone. He shook her gently. What, darling?"" he demanded. Now what?"" he finally demanded, with a touch of the old scorn.",1
4571,"But nothing, daddy! she protested, her timid little voice rising in a note of desperate protest. Nothing, daddy! She squirmed a little to get free. Reluctantly Fox let her go. The child ducked right down into her chair, still with her eyes averted, and concluded with a little gasping laugh of protest: ""You're so funny, daddy!""  Fox resumed his seat and still continued to regard her sternly, gravely, with alarmed solicitude, and a little scorn.",1
4572,"She shot a frightened look at him and ducked her head down towards her plate. Is anything wrong?"" said Fox, in a low voice. But naturally--not!""--a protesting and exasperated little gasp of laughter. Why should anything be wrong? Honestly, you're so strange, daddy!""  ""Well, then,"" said Fox, with patient resignation.",1
4573,"But nothing! I keep telling you, there's nothing! That's what I've told you from the feerst!""  All of the children of the Fox say ""feerst"" for ""first"", ""beerst"" for ""burst"", ""theerst"" for ""thirst"".",1
4574,"Why, no one knows. It seems to be a tribal accent, not only among all of Fox's children, but among all of their young cousins on the Fox's side. It is almost as if they were creatures of some isolated family, immured for generations on some lonely island, cut off from the world, and speaking some lost accent that their ancestors spoke three hundred years ago. Moreover, their tone is characterised by a kind of drawl--not the languorous drawl of the deep South, but a protesting drawl, a wearied-out, exasperated drawl, as if they have almost given up hope of making Fox--or someone--understand what ought to be obvious without any explanation whatsoever. Thus:  ""But nothing, daddy!",1
4575,"I've told you that from the f-e-e-r-s-t! Well, then, what is it, darling? Fox demanded. Why do you look like that?""--with an emphatic downward movement of the head.",1
4576,"But look like what? the child protested. Oh, daddy, honestly""--she gasped, with a little strained laugh, and looked away--""I don't know what you're talking about. Portia brought smoking oatmeal and put it down before her, and the girl, saying timidly: ""Good morning, Portia,"" ducked her head and began to eat hastily.",1
4577,"Fox continued to look at the child sternly, gravely, with a troubled expression in his eyes. Looking up suddenly, she put down her spoon, and cried: But, daddy--wha-a-t?""  ""Are those scoundrels going to be here again to-day?"" said Fox.",1
4578,"Oh, daddy, what scoundrels?...Honestly! She twisted in her chair, gasped a little, tried to laugh, picked up her spoon, started to go on eating, then put her spoon down again. Those scoundrels,"" said the Fox, ""that--you women""--he inclined his head with scornful emphasis--""have brought in to destroy my home. But who are you talking about?"" she protested, looking round like a hunted animal for a means of escape.",1
4579,"I don't know who you mean. I mean,"" said Fox, ""those interior decorating fellows""--here his voice was filled with the dismissal of an unutterable contempt--""that you and your mother have imported to wreck the house. But I had nothing to do with it!",1
4580,"the girl protested. Oh, daddy, you're so-----"" she broke off, squirmed, and turned away with a little laugh. So--what?"" said Fox, low, hoarse, and scornful.",1
4581,"Oh, I don't know--so--so stra-a-nge! You say such funny thi-i-ngs!""  ""Have you women,"" Fox went on, ""decided when you're going to let me have a little peace in my own house?""  ""Let you have a little pe-a-ce?...What have I done? If you don't want the decorators, why don't you speak to mo-o-ther? Because""--Fox inclined his head with a slow, ironic emphasis upon the word--""because--I--don't--count!",1
4582,"I'm only the--Old--Grey--Mule--among six women--and, of course, anything is good enough for me! But what have we done? We haven't done anything to you! Why do you act so p-e-e-r-secuted?...Oh, daddy, honestly! She squirmed desperately, tried to laugh, turned away, and ducked her head down towards her plate again.",1
4583,"Sitting back in his chair, one hand clasped upon the arm, his whole being withdrawn, remote, in an attitude eloquent of deep, unhoping patience, Fox continued to regard the child gravely for a moment. Then he thrust his hand into his pocket, pulled his watch out and looked at it, glanced at the child again, and shook his head in a movement packed with stern reproach and silent accusation. She looked up, quick and startled, laid her spoon down, and gasped:  ""Now what?",1
4584,"What are you shaking your he-a-ad for? What is it now?""  ""Is your mother up? But naturally, I don't kno-o-w!""  ""Are your sisters up?""  ""But, da-a-dy, how can I tell?""  ""Did you get to bed early?""  ""Ye-e-e-s,"" in a drawl of protest.",1
4585,"What time did your sisters get to bed?""  ""But, of course, I have no way of kno-o-wing! Why don't you ask the-e-m?""  Fox looked at the watch again, then at the child, and shook his head once more. Women! he said quietly, and put the watch back into his pocket.",1
4586,"The child by now has finished with her oatmeal--all she wants of it. Now she slides out of her chair and, with face averted, tries to glide past Fox, out of the room. Fox gets up quickly, puts his arms round her, says in a low, quick, worried tone:  ""Oh, darling, where are you going?""  ""But to sch-o-o-ol, of course!""  ""Darling, stay and eat your breakfast!",1
4587,"But I've e-e-a-ten! Oh, you haven't! whispers Fox impatiently.",1
4588,"But I've eaten all I wa-a-a-nt!""  ""You haven't eaten anything! he whispers scornfully. But I don't want any more,"" she protests, looks desperately about, and struggles to free herself. Oh, let me go-o-o, daddy! I'll be late! Then be late!",1
4589,"whispers the great watch-watcher and head-shaker scornfully. Stay and eat your breakfast!""--punctuating these decisive words with slow nods of emphasis. But I ca-a-n't! I've got to read a pa-a-per. A--what?""  ""A t-e-e-r-m paper--for Miss Allen's class--it comes at nine o'clock.""  ""Oh,"" says Fox slowly, ""I see.",1
4590,"In a low, almost inaudible tone, ""On--Whitman?""  ""Ye-e-e-s.""  ""Oh...Did you read the book I gave you--the one with his war diary and notes? Ye-e-e-s.""  ""Astonishing!"" whispers Fox. Isn't it astonishing? You can see just how he did it, can't you? He--he got right up on everything,"" Fox whispers, ""just as if he were the thing itself--as if it were happening to him!""  ""Ye-e-e-s."" She looks desperately around, then with averted eyes blurts out: ""You were right about the other thing, too.",1
4591,"What other thing?""  ""About night--how there's so much night and darkness in himhis--his feeling for night. Oh,"" Fox whispers slowly, his sea-pale eyes misted with reflection. Did you tell about that, too?""  ""Ye-e-s.",1
4592,"It's tr-u-e. After you told me, I read him again, and it's tr-u-e.""  Shy, desperate, timid, stricken as she is, she nevertheless knows it's true when it's true. That's fine! Fox whispers, and shakes his head sharply with immense satisfaction. I'll bet it's good!",1
4593,"The girl's ivory features flush crimson. Like Fox, she loves praise, yet cannot stand to have it spoken. She squirms, is terrified, is hoping against hope----  ""I don't kno-o-w,"" she gasps.",1
4594,"Miss Allen didn't like the last paper I wrote--what I said about Mark Twain. Then,"" Fox whispers, low and scornfully, ""let Miss Allen not like it. That was a fine paper,"" he whispers. What--what you said about the River was just right. I kno-o-w!",1
4595,"And that was the part she didn't like. She didn't seem to know what I was talking about--said it was immature and not sound, and gave me a 'C'. Oh,"" says Fox absently, thinking all the time with an immense satisfaction of the spirit: ""What a girl this is!",1
4596,"She has a fine mind. She--she understands things!""  ""You see, darling,"" Fox whispers gently, coming back to Miss Allen, ""it's not their fault. These people do the best they can--but--but they just can't seem to understand,"" he whispers. You see, Miss Allen is an--an academic kind of person--I guess, kind of an old maid, really,"" he whispers, with an emphatic movement of the head--""and that kind of person, darling, just wouldn't be able to understand what Whitman and Mark Twain and Keats are like...It's--it's a shame,"" Fox mutters, and shakes his head, his eyes troubled with regret--""it's a shame we've got to hear about these people first in--in schools--from--from people like Miss Allen. You see, darling,"" Fox says gently, his face cocked sideways, his good ear pointing towards the girl, his language simple as a shoe, his face keen, shrewd, thoughtful, and absorbed, and radiant as a blade of light, as it always is when interest and reflection hold the wise serpent of his brain--""you see, darling, schools are all right, really--but the Thing they do is different from the Thing that Keats and Whitman and Mark Twain do...People like that really have no place in schools. A--a school,"" Fox whispers, ""is an academic kind of place, you see--and the people that you find in schools are academic people--and these other kind of people--the poets,"" whispers Fox, ""are not academic people--they're--they're really against what the academic people do--they are people who--who discover things for themselves,"" Fox whispers, ""who burst through and make another world--and the academic people cannot understand them--so that's why what the academic people say about them is--is not much good,"" Fox whispers. For a moment he is silent, then shakes his head and mutters in a low tone of profound regret: ""It's a pity! Too bad you've got to hear about it first in schools--but--but just do the best you can with it--get what you can from it--and--and when those people""--whisper mixed with understanding, pity, and contempt--""have gone as far as they can go, just forget about the rest they tell you. I kno-o-w!",1
4597,"But, really, daddy, when Miss Allen starts drawing charts and diagrams upon the blackboard, showing how they did it--it's--it's aw-w-full I can't be-e-ar it--it just makes everything so,--te-er-rible!...Oh, daddy, let me go! She squirms to free herself again, her tender features tortured with self-consciousness. Please, daddy! I've got to! I'll be late! How are you going?""  ""But naturally, the way I always go.",1
4598,"By taxi?""  ""But of course not, I take the str-e-e-t car. Oh...What street car?""  ""The Lexington A-a-a-venue. Alone?"" says Fox in a low, grave, troubled tone.",1
4599,"But, of course, daddy! He looks at her sternly with a sorrow-troubled face, and shakes his head. But what's wrong with taking the str-e-e-t car? Oh, daddy, you're so-o--"" she squirms, looks off indefinitely, her face touched by a smile of agonised embarrassment. Please, daddy! Let me go-o-o! I tell you I'll be late! She pushes a little to release herself, he kisses her, and lets her go reluctantly.",1
4600,"Good-bye, darling""--low, hoarse, tender, troubled with grave solicitude. You will take care, won't you?""  ""But, of course! A little agonised laugh. There's nothing to take care. Then, suddenly, in a timid little voice: ""Good-bye, daddy""--and she is gone, swiftly, silently, like fading light.",1
4601,"Fox, hands upon his hips, with a look half-trouble and half-tenderness, follows her with sea-pale eyes until she has gone. Then he turns back to the table, sits down again, and picks up the paper.  News. 29. The Hollow Men"" Fox picks up the paper and settles back to read it with keen relish. The paper is the Times. (He read the Tribune late last night: waited up for it, would not miss it, has never missed it, could not sleep if he had not read it.) Morning now, Fox reads the Times.",1
4602,"How does he read the Times? He reads it the way Americans have always read the paper. He also reads it as few Americans have ever read the paper--with nostrils sensitive, dilating with proud scorn, sniffing for the news behind the news.",1
4603,"He loves it--even loves the Times--loves Love unlovable--and don't we all? Ink-fresh papers, millions of them--ink-fresh with morning, orange juice, waffles, eggs and bacon, and cups of strong hot coffee. How fine it is, here in America, at ink-fresh, coffee-fragrant morning, to read the paper!",1
4604,"How often have we read the paper in America! How often have we seen it blocked against our doors! Little route-boys fold and block it, so to throw it--and so we find it and unfold it, crackling and ink-laden, at our doors. Sometimes we find it tossed there lightly with flat plop; sometimes we find it thrown with solid, whizzing whack against the clapboards (clapboards here, most often, in America); sometimes, as now in Turtle Bay, servants find just freshly folded sheets laid neatly down in doorways, and take them to the table for their masters. No matter how it got there, we always find it.",1
4605,"How we do love the paper in America! How we do love the paper, all! Why do we love the paper in America? Why do we love the paper, all?  Mad masters, I will tell ye why.",1
4606,"Because the paper is ""the news"" here in America, and we love the smell of news. We love the smell of news that's ""fit to print"". We also love the smell of news not fit to print. We love, besides, the smell of facts that news is made of. Therefore we love the paper because the news is so fit-printable--so unprintable--and so fact-printable.",1
4607,"Is the news, then, like America? No, it's not--and Fox, unlike the rest of you, mad masters, turns the pages knowing it is just the news and not America that he reads there in his Times. The news is not America, nor is America the news--the news is in America. It is a kind of light at morning, and at evening, and at midnight in America. It is a kind of growth and record and excrescence of our life. It is not good enough--it does not tell our story--yet it is the news!",1
4608,"Fox reads (proud nose sharp-sniffing with a scornful relish):  An unidentified man fell or jumped yesterday at noon from the twelfth storey of the Admiral Francis Drake Hotel, corner of Hay and Apple Streets, in Brooklyn. The man, who was about thirty-five years old, registered at the hotel about a week ago, according to the police, as C. Green. Police are of the opinion that this was an assumed name. Pending identification, the body is being held at the King's County Morgue. This, then, is news. Is it also the whole story, Admiral Drake? No! Yet we do not supply the whole story--we who have known all the lights and weathers of America--as Fox supplies it now:",1
4609,"Well, then, it's news, and it happened in your own hotel, brave Admiral Drake. It didn't happen in the Penn-Pitt at Pittsburgh, nor the Phil-Penn at Philadelphia, nor the York-Albany at Albany, nor the Hudson-Troy at Troy, nor the Libya-Ritz at Libya Hill, nor the Clay-Calhoun at Columbia, nor the Richmond-Lee at Richmond, nor the George Washington at Easton, Pennsylvania, Canton, Ohio, Terre Haute, Indiana, Danville, Virginia, Houston, Texas, and ninety-seven other places; nor at the Abraham Lincoln at Springfield, Massachusetts, Hartford, Connecticut, Wilmington, Delaware, Cairo, Illinois, Kansas City, Missouri, Los Angeles, California, and one hundred and thirty-six other towns; nor at the Andrew Jackson, the Roosevelt (Theodore or Franklin--take your choice), the Jefferson Davis, the Daniel Webster, the Stonewall Jackson, the U.S. Grant, the Commodore Vanderbilt, the Waldorf-Astor, the Adams House, the Parker House, the Palmer House, the Taft, the McKinley, the Emerson (Waldo or Bromo), the Harding, the Coolidge, the Hoover, the Albert G. Fall, the Harry Daugherty, the Rockefeller, the Harriman, the Carnegie or the Frick, the Christopher Columbus or the Leif Ericsson, the Ponce-de-Leon or the Magellan, in the remaining eight hundred and forty-three cities of America--but at the Francis Drake, brave Admiral--your own hotel--so, of course, you'll want to know what happened. An unidentified man""--well, then, this man was an American. About thirty-five years old"" with ""an assumed name""--well, then, call him C. Green as he called himself ironically in the hotel register. C. Green, the unidentified American, ""fell or jumped,"" then, ""yesterday at noon...in Brooklyn""--worth nine lines of print in to-day's Times--one of seven thousand who died yesterday upon this continent--one of three hundred and fifty who died yesterday in this very city (see dense, close columns of obituaries, page 15: begin with ""Aaronson"", so through the alphabet to ""Zorn""). C. Green came here ""a week ago""----  And came from where?",1
4610,"From the deep South, or the Mississippi Valley, or the Middle West? From Minneapolis, Bridgeport, Boston, or a little town in Old Catawba? From Scranton, Toledo, St. Louis, or the desert whiteness of Los Angeles? From the pine barrens of the Atlantic coastal plain, or from the Pacific shore?",1
4611,"And so--was what, brave Admiral Drake? Had seen, felt, heard, smelled, tasted--what? Had known--what?  Had known all our brutal violence of weather: the burned swelter of July across the nation, the smell of the slow, rank river, the mud, the bottom lands, the weed growth, and the hot, coarse, humid fragrance of the corn.",1
4612,"The kind that says: ""Jesus, but it's hot!""--pulls off his coat, and mops his face, and goes in shirt-sleeves in St. Louis, goes to August's for a Swiss on rye with mustard, and a mug of beer. The kind that says: ""Damn! It's hot! in South Carolina, slouches in shirt-sleeves and straw hat down South Main Street, drops into Evans Drug Store for a dope, says to the soda jerker: ""Is it hot enough fer you to-day, Jim? The kind that reads in the paper of the heat, the deaths, and the prostration, reads it with a certain satisfaction, hangs on grimly day by day and loses sleep at night, can't sleep for heat, is tired in the morning, says: ""Jesus! It can't last for ever! as heat lengthens into August, and the nation gasps for breath, and the green that was young in May now mottles, fades and bleaches, withers, goes heat-brown. Will boast of coolness in the mountains, Admiral Drake. Always cool at night! May get a little warm around the middle of the day, but you'll sleep with blankets every night. Then summer fades and passes, and October comes.",1
4613,"Will smell smoke then, and feel an unsuspected sharpness, a thrill of nervous, swift elation, a sense of sadness and departure. C. Green doesn't know the reason, Admiral Drake, but lights slant and shorten in the afternoon, there is a misty pollen of old gold in light at noon, a murky redness in the lights of dusk, a frosty stillness, and the barking of the dogs; the maples flame upon the hills, the gums are burning, bronze the oak leaves and, the aspens yellow; then come the rains, the sodden dead-brown of the fallen leaves, the smoke-stark branches--and November comes. Waiting for winter in the little towns, and winter comes. It is really the same in big towns and the cities, too, with the bleak enclosure of the winter multiplied. In the commerce of the day, engaged and furious, then darkness, and the bleak monotony of ""Where shall we go? What shall we do? The winter grips us, closes round each house--the stark, harsh light encysts us--and C. Green walks the streets. Sometimes hard lights burn on him, Admiral Drake, bleak faces stream beneath the lights, amusement signs are winking. On Broadway, the constant plaze of sterile lights; in little towns, no less, the clustered raisins of hard light on Main Street. On Broadway, swarming millions up to midnight; in little towns, hard lights and frozen silence--no one, nothing, after ten o'clock. But in the hearts of C. Greens everywhere, bleak boredom, undefined despair, and ""Christ! Where shall I go now? When will winter end? So longs for spring, and wishes it were Saturday, brave Admiral Drake.",1
4614,"Saturday night arrives with the thing that we are waiting for. Oh, it will come to-night; the thing that we have been expecting all our lives will come to-night, on Saturday! ' On Saturday night across America we are waiting for it, and ninety million Greens go moth-wise to the lights to find it. Surely it will come to-night! So Green goes out to find it, and he finds--hard lights again, saloons along Third Avenue, or the Greek's place in a little town--and then hard whisky, gin, and drunkenness, and brawls and fights and vomit.",1
4615,"Sunday morning, aching head. Sunday afternoon, and in the cities the chop-suey signs wink on and flash their sterile promises of unborn joy. Sunday night, and the hard stars, and the bleak enclosures of our wintry weather--the buildings of old rusty brick, in cold enclosed, the fronts of old stark brown, the unpainted houses, the deserted factories, wharves, piers, warehouses, and office buildings, the tormented shabbiness of Sixth Avenues; and in the smaller towns, bleak Main Streets, desolate with shabby store fronts and be-raisined clusters of lamp standards, and in the residential streets of wooden houses (dark by ten o'clock), the moaning of stark branches, the stiff lights, limb-bepatterned, shaking at street corners. The light shines there with wintry bleakness on the clapboard front and porch of a shabby house where the policeman lives--blank and desolate upon the stuffy, boxlike little parlour where the policeman's daughter amorously receives--and almost--not quite--gives. Hot, fevered, fearful, and insatiate, it is all too close to the cold street light--too creaking, panting, flimsy-close to others in the flimsy house--too close to the policeman's solid and slow-creaking tread--yet somehow valiant, somehow strong, somehow triumphant over the stale varnish of the little parlour, the nearness of the street, the light, the creaking boughs, and papa's tread--somehow triumphant with hot panting, with rose lips and tender tongue, white underleg and tight-locked thighs--by these intimacies of fear and fragrant hot desire will beat the ashen monotone of time and even the bleak and grey duration of the winter out.",1
4616,"Does this surprise you, Admiral Drake?  ""But Christ!""--Green leaves the house, his life is bitter with desire, the stiff light creaks. When will it end?"" thinks Green. When will spring come?""  It comes at last unhoped for, after hoping, comes when least expected, and when given up.",1
4617,"In March there is a day that's almost spring, and C. Green, strong with will to have it so, says: ""Well, it's here""--and it is gone like smoke. You can't look spring too closely in the eye in March. Raw days return, and blown light, and gusty moanings of the wind. Then April comes, and small, soaking rain. The air is wet and raw and chilled, but with a smell of spring now, a smell of earth, of grass exploding in small patches, here and there a blade, a bud, a leaf. And spring comes, marvellous, for a day or two--""It's here! Green thinks. It's here at last!""--and he is wrong again. It goes, chill days and greyness and small, soaking rains return. Green loses hope. There is no spring! he says. You never get spring any more; you jump from winter into summer--we'll have summer now and the hot weather before you know it. Then spring comes--explodes out of the earth in a green radiance--comes up overnight!",1
4618,"It's April twenty-eighth--the tree there in the city backyard is smoke-yellow, feathered with the striplings of young leaf! It's April twenty-ninth--the leaf, the yellow, and the smoke have thickened overnight. April thirtieth--you can watch it grow and thicken with your eye! Then May the first--the tree's in leaf now, almost full and dense, young, feather-fresh! The whole spring has exploded from the earth!",1
4619,"All's explosive with us really, Admiral Drake--spring, the brutal summer, frost, October, February in Dakota with fifty-one below, spring floods, two hundred drowning along Ohio bottoms, in Missouri, in New England, all through Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Tennessee. Spring shot at us overnight, and everything with us is vast, explosive, floodlike. A few hundred dead in floods, a hundred in a wave of heat, twelve thousand in a year by murder, thirty thousand with the motor-car--it all means nothing here. Floods like this would drown out France; death like this would plunge England in black mourning; but in America a few thousand C. Greens more or less, drowned, murdered, killed by motor-cars, or dead by jumping out of windows on their heads--well, it just means nothing to us--the next flood, or next week's crop of death and killings, wash it out. We do things on a large scale, Admiral Drake.",1
4620,"The tar-smell in the streets now, children shouting, and the smell of earth; the sky shell-blue and faultless, a sapphire sparkle everywhere; and in the air the brave stick-candy whippings of a flag. C. Green thinks of the baseball games, the raw-hide arm of Lefty Grove, the resilient crack of ashwood on the horsehide ball, the waiting pockets of the well-oiled mitts, the warm smell of the bleachers, the shouted gibes of shirt-sleeved men, the sprawl and monotone of inning after inning. (Baseball's a dull game, really; that's the reason that it is so good. We do not love the game so much as we love the sprawl and drowse and shirt-sleeved apathy of it.) On Saturday afternoon, C. Green goes out to the ball park and sits there in the crowd, awaiting the sudden sharpness and the yell of crisis. Then the game ends and the crowd flows out across the green turf of the playing-field. Sunday, Green spends the day out in the country in his flivver, with a girl.",1
4621,"Then summer comes again, heat-blazing summer, humid, murked with mist, sky-glazed with brutal weariness--and C. Green mops his face and sweats and says: ""Jesus! Will it never end? This, then, is C. Green ""thirty-five years old""--""unidentified""--and an American.",1
4622,"In what way an American? In what way different from the men you knew, old Drake? When the ships bore home again and Cape St. Vincent blazed in Spaniard's eye--or when old Drake was returning with his men, beating coastwise from strange seas abreast, past the Scilly Isles towards the slant of evening fields, chalk cliffs, the harbour's arms, the town's sweet cluster and the spire--where was Green?  When, in red-oak thickets at the break of day, coon-skinned, the huntsmen of the wilderness lay for bear, heard arrows rattling in the laurel leaves, the bullets' whining plunk, and waited with cocked musket by the tree--where was Green?",1
4623,"Or when, with strong faces turning towards the setting sun, hawk-eyed and Indian-visaged men bore gun-stocks on the western trails and sternly heard the fierce war-whoops around the Painted Buttes--where, then, was Green?  Was never there with Drake's men in the evening when the sails stood in from the Americas! Was never there beneath the Spaniard's swarthy eye at Vincent's Cape! Was never there in the red-oak thicket in the morning! Was never there to hear the war-cries round the Painted Buttes!",1
4624,"No, no. He was no voyager of unknown seas, no pioneer of western trails. He was life's little man, life's nameless cypher, life's man-swarm atom, life's American--and now he lies disjected and exploded on a street in Brooklyn!",1
4625,"He was a dweller in mean streets, was Green, a man-mote in the jungle of the city, a resident of grimy steel and stone, a mole who burrowed in rusty brick, a stunned spectator of enormous salmon-coloured towers, hued palely with the morning. He was a renter of shabby wooden houses in a little town, an owner of a raw new bungalow on the outskirts of the town. He was a waker in bleak streets at morning, an alarm-clock watcher, saying: ""Jesus, I'll be late. --a fellow who took short cuts through the corner lot, behind the advertising signs; a fellow used to concrete horrors of hot day and blazing noon; a man accustomed to the tormented hodge-podge of our architectures, used to broken pavements, ash-cans, shabby store fronts, dull green paint, the elevated structure, grinding traffic, noise, and streets be-tortured with a thousand bleak and dismal signs. He was accustomed to the gas tanks going out of town, he was an atom of machinery in an endless flow, going, stopping, going to the winking of the lights; he tore down concrete roads on Sundays, past the hot-dog stands and filling-stations; he would return at darkness; hunger lured him to the winking splendour of chop-suey signs; and midnight found him in The Coffee Pot, to prowl above a mug of coffee, tear a coffee-cake in fragments, and wear away the slow grey ash of time and boredom with other men in grey hats and with skins of tallow-grey, at Joe the Greek's.  C. Green could read (which Drake could not), but not too accurately; could write, too (which the Spaniard couldn't), but not too well.",1
4626,"C. Green had trouble over certain words, spelled them out above the coffee mug at midnight, with a furrowed brow, slow-shaping lips, and ""Jesus! when news stunned him--for he read the news. Preferred the news with pictures, too, girls with voluptuous legs crossed sensually, dresses above the knees, and plump dolls' faces full of vacant lechery. Green liked news ""hot""--not as Fox knows it, not subtly sniffing with strange-scornful nostrils for the news behind the news--but straight from the shoulder--socko!--biff!--straight off the griddle, with lots of mustard, shapely legs, roadside wrecks and mutilated bodies, gangsters' molls and gunmen's hideouts, tallow faces of the night that bluntly stare at flashlight lenses--this and talk of ""heart-balm"", ""love-thief"", ""sex-hijacker""--all of this liked Green.",1
4627,"Yes, Green liked the news--and now, a bit of news himself (nine lines of print in Times), has been disjected and exploded on a Brooklyn pavement! Well, such was our friend, C. Green, who read, but not too well; and wrote, but not too easily; who smelled, but not too strongly; felt, but not too deeply; saw, but not too clearly--yet had smelled the tar in May, smelled the slow, rank yellow of the rivers, and the clean, coarse corn; had seen the slants of evening on the hill-flanks in the Smokies, and the bronze swell of the earth, the broad, deep red of Pennsylvania barns, proud-proportioned and as dominant across the fields as bulls; had felt the frost and silence in October; had heard the whistles of the train wail back in darkness, and the horns of New Year's Eve, and--""Jesus! There's another year gone by! What now?""  No Drake was he, no Spaniard, no coon-skin cap, no strong face burning west.",1
4628,"Yet, in some remote and protoplasmic portion, he was a little of each of these. A little Scotch, perhaps, was Green, a little Irish, English, Spanish even, and some German--a little of each part, all compacted and exploded into nameless atom of America! No. Green--poor little Green--was not a man like Drake. He was just a cinder out of life--for the most part, a thinker of base thoughts, a creature of unsharpened, coarse perceptions. He was meagre in the hips, he did not have much juice or salt in him. Drake gnawed the beef from juicy bones in taverns, drank tankards of brown ale, swore salty curses through his whiskers, wiped his mouth with the back of his hard hand, threw the beef bone to his dog, and pounded with his tankard for more ale. Green ate in cafeterias, prowled at midnight over coffee and a doughnut or a sugar-coated bun, went to the chop-suey joint on Saturday nights and swallowed chow mein, noodle soup, and rice. Green's mouth was mean and thin and common, it ran to looseness and a snarl; his skin was grey and harsh and dry; his eyes were dull and full of fear. Drake was self-contained: the world his oyster, seas his pastures, mighty distances his wings. His eyes were sea-pale (like the eyes of Fox); his ship was England. Green had no ship, he had a motor-car, and tore down concrete roads on Sunday, and halted with the lights against him with the million other cinders hurtling through hot space. Green walked on level concrete sidewalks and on pavements grey, through hot and grimy streets past rusty tenements. Drake set his sails against the west, he strode the buoyant, sea-washed decks, he took the Spaniard and his gold, and at the end he stood in to the sweet enfoldments of the spire, the clustered town, the emerald fields that slope to Plymouth harbour--then Green came!",1
4629,"We who never saw brave Drake can have no difficulty conjuring up an image of the kind of man he was. With equal ease we can imagine the bearded Spaniard, and almost hear his swarthy oaths. But neither Drake nor Spaniard could ever have imagined Green. Who could have foreseen him, this cypher of America, exploded now upon a street in Brooklyn?  Behold him, Admiral Drake!",1
4630,"Observe the scene now! Listen to the people! Here is something strange as the Armadas, the gold-laden cargoes of the bearded Spaniards, the vision of unfound Americas!",1
4631,"What do you see here, Admiral Drake? Well, first, a building--your own hotel--such a building as the folk of Plymouth never saw. A great block of masonry, pale-hued, grimy-white, fourteen storeys tall, stamped in an unvarying pattern with many windows. Sheeted glass below, the store front piled with medicines and toilet articles, perfumes, cosmetics, health contrivances. Within, a soda fountain, Admiral Drake. The men in white with monkey caps, soda jerkers sullen with perpetual overdriven irritation. Beneath the counter, pools of sloppy water, filth, and unwashed dishes. Across the counter, Jewesses with fat, rouged lips consuming ice-cream sodas and pimento sandwiches.",1
4632,"Outside upon the concrete sidewalk lies the form of our exploded friend, C. Green. A crowd has gathered round--taxi-drivers, passersby, hangers-on about the subway station, people working in the neighbourhood, and the police. No one has dared to touch exploded Green as yet--they stand there in a rapt and fascinated circle, looking at him.",1
4633,"Not much to look at either, Admiral Drake; not even those who trod your gory decks would call the sight a pretty one. Our friend has landed on his head--""taken a nose dive"", as we say--and smashed his brains out at the iron base of the second lamp-post from the corner. (It is the same lamp-post as heretofore described, to be found throughout America--a ""standard"", standardised, supporting five hard grapes of frosted glass.)",1
4634,"So here Green lies, on the concrete sidewalk all disjected. No head is left, the head is gone now, head's exploded; only brains are left. The brains are pink, and almost bloodless, Admiral Drake. (There's not much blood here--we shall tell you why.) But brains exploded are somewhat like pale sausage meat, fresh-ground. Brains are stuck hard to the lamp-post, too; there is a certain driven emphasis about them, as if they had been shot hydraulically out of a force-hose against the post.",1
4635,"The head, as we have said, is gone completely; a few fragments of the skull are scattered round--but of the face, the features, forehead--nothing! They have all been blown out, as by some inner explosion. Nothing is left but the back of the skull, which curiously remains, completely hollowed out and vacant, and curved over, like the rounded handle of a walking-stick.",1
4636,"The body, five feet eight or nine of it, of middling weight, is lying--we were going to say ""face downwards""; had we not better say ""stomach downwards""?--on the sidewalk. It is well-dressed, too, in cheap, neatly pressed, machine-made clothes: tan shoes and socks with a clocked pattern, suit of a light texture, brownish-red in hue, a neat canary-coloured shirt with attached collar--obviously C. Green had a nice feeling for proprieties! As for the body itself, save for a certain indefinable and curiously ""disjected"" quality, one could scarcely tell that every bone in it is broken. The hands are still spread out, half-folded and half-clenched, with a still-warm and startling eloquence of recent life. (It happened just four minutes ago!)",1
4637,"Well, where's the blood, then, Drake? You're used to blood; you'd like to know. Well, you've heard of casting bread upon the waters, Drake, and having it return--but never yet, I'll vow, of casting blood upon the streets--and having it run away--and then come back to you! But here it comes now, down the street--down Apple Street, round the corner into Hay, across the street now towards C. Green, the lamp-post, and the crowd!--a young Italian youth, blunt-featured, low-browed, and bewildered, his black eyes blank with horror, tongue mumbling thickly, arm held firmly by a policeman, suit and shirt all drenched with blood, and face be-spattered with it! A stir of sudden interest in the crowd, sharp nudges, low-toned voices whispering:  ""Here he is!",1
4638,"Th' guy that 'got it'!...Sure, that's him--you know him, that Italian kid that works inside in the news-stand--he was standin' deh beside the post! Sure, that's the guy!--talkin' to another guy--he got it all! That's the reason you didn't see more blood--this guy got it!--Sure! The guy just missed him by six inches!--Sure! I'm tellin' you I saw it, ain't I? I looked up an' saw him in the air! He'd a hit this guy, but when he saw that he was goin' to hit the lamp-post, he put out his hands an' tried to keep away! That's the reason that he didn't hit this guy!... But this guy heard him when he hit, an' turned round--and zowie!--he got all of it right in his face!",1
4639,"And another, whispering and nudging, nodding towards the horror-blank, thick-mumbling Italian boy: ""Jesus! Look at th' guy, will yuh!... He don't know what he's doing!...He don't know yet what happened to him!...Sure! He got it all. I tell yuh! He was standin' deh beside the post, wit a package undehneath one ahm--an' when it happened--when he got it--he just stahted runnin'... He don't know yet what's happened!... That's what I'm tellin' yuh--th' guy just stahted runnin' when he got it.",1
4640,"And one policeman (to another): ""...Sure, I yelled to Pat to stop him. He caught up with him at Borough Hall... He just kept on runnin'--he don't know yet what happened to him.",1
4641,"And the Italian youth, thick-mumbling: ""...Jeez! W'at happened?...Jeez!...I was standin' talkin' to a guy--I heard it hit...Jeez!...W'at happened, anyway?...I got it all oveh me!...Jeez!...I just stahted runnin'... Jeez! I'm sick!""  Voices: ""Here, take 'im into the drug-store!...Wash 'im off!...",1
4642,That guy needs a shot of liquor!...Sure! Take him into the drug-stoeh deh!... They'll fix him up!,1
4643,"The plump, young, rather effeminate, but very intelligent young Jew who runs the news-stand in the corridor, talking to everyone round him, excitedly and indignantly: ""...Did I see it? Listen! I saw everything! I was coming across the street, looked up, and saw him in the air!...See it?...Listen! If someone had taken a big ripe water-melon and dropped it on the street from the twelfth floor you'd have some idea what it was like!...See it! I'll tell the world I saw it! I don't want to see anything like that again! Then excitedly, with a kind of hysterical indignation: ""Shows no consideration for other people, that's all I've got to say! If a man is going to do a thing like that, why does he pick a place like this--one of the busiest corners in Brooklyn?... How did he know he wouldn't hit someone? Why, if that boy had been standing six inches nearer to the post, he'd have killed him, as sure as you live!... And here he does it right in front of all these people who have to look at it! It shows he had no consideration for other people! A man who'd do a thing like that...""  (Alas, poor Jew!",1
4644,"As if C. Green, now past considering, had considered nice ""considerations"".) A taxi-driver, impatiently: ""That's what I'm tellin' yuh!... I watched him for five minutes before he jumped. He crawled out on the window-sill an' stood there for five minutes, makin' up his mind!... Sure, I saw him! Lots of people saw him! Impatiently, irritably:-""Why didn't we do somethin' to stop him? F'r Chri' sake, what was there to do? A guy who'd do a thing like that is nuts to start with! You don't think he'd listen to anything we had to say, do you?...Sure, we did yell at him!...Jesus!... We was almost afraid to yell at him--we made motions to him to get back--tried to hold his attention while the cops sneaked round the corner into the hotel... Sure, the cops got there just a second after he jumped--I don't know if he jumped when he heard 'em comin', or what happened, but Christ!--he stood there gettin' ready for five minutes while we watched!",1
4645,"And a stocky little Czech-Bohemian, who works in the delicatessen-fruit store on the corner, one block down: ""Did I hear it! Say, you could have heard it for six blocks! Sure! Everybody heard it! The minute that I heard it, I knew what had happened, too! I come runnin'! People press and shuffle in the crowd.",1
4646,"A man comes round the corner, presses forward to get a better look, runs into a-little fat, baldheaded man in front of him who is staring at the Thing with a pale, sweating, suffering, fascinated face, by accident knocks off the little' fat man's straw hat. The new straw hat hits the pavement dryly, the little fat, bald-headed man scrambles for it, clutches it, and turns round on the man who has knocked it off, both of them stammering frantic apologies: Oh, excuse me!...'Scuse me!...'Scuse me!...Sorry!""  ""Quite all right...All right!...All right.",1
4647,"Observe now, Admiral, with what hypnotic concentration the people are examining the grimy-white facade of your hotel. Watch their faces and expressions. Their eyes go travelling upwards slowly--up--up--up. The building seems to widen curiously, to be distorted, to flare out wedgelike till it threatens to annihilate the sky, overwhelm the will, and crush the spirit. (These optics, too, American, Admiral Drake.) The eyes continue on past storey after storey up the wall until they finally arrive and come to rest with focal concentration on that single open window twelve floors up. It is no jot different from all the other windows, but now the vision of the crowd is fastened on it with a fatal and united interest. And after staring at it fixedly, the eyes come travelling slowly down again--down--down--down--the faces strained a little, mouths all slightly puckered as if something set the teeth on edge--and slowly, with fascinated measurement--down--down--down--until the eyes reach sidewalk, lamp-post, and--the Thing again.",1
4648,"The pavement finally halts all, stops all, answers all. It is the American pavement, Admiral Drake, our universal city sidewalk, a wide, hard stripe of grey-white cement, blocked accurately with dividing lines. It is the hardest, coldest, cruellest, most impersonal pavement in the world: all of the indifference, the atomic desolation, the exploded nothingness of one hundred million nameless ""Greens"" is in it.",1
4649,"In Europe, Drake, we find worn stone, all hollowed out and rubbed to rounded edges. For centuries the unknown lives of men now buried touched and wore this stone, and when we see it something stirs within our hearts, and something strange and dark and passionate moves our souls, and--""They were here! we say.",1
4650,"Not so, the streets, the sidewalks, the paved places of America. Has man been here? No. Only unnumbered nameless Greens have swarmed and passed here, and none has left a mark.",1
4651,"Did ever the eye go seaward here with searching for the crowded sail, with longing for the strange and unknown coasts of Spain? Did ever beauty here come home to the heart and eyes? Did ever, in the thrusting crowd, eye look to eye, and face to face, and heart to heart, and know the moment of their meeting--stop and pause, and be oblivious in this place, and make one spot of worn pavement sacred stone? You won't believe it, Admiral Drake, but it is so--these things have happened on the pavements of America. But, as you see yourself, they have not left their mark.",1
4652,"You, old Drake, when last your fellow townsmen saw you at the sailing of the ships, walked with the crowd along the quay, past the spire and cluster of the town, down to the cool lap of the water; and from your deck, as you put out, you watched the long, white, fading arm of your own coast. And in the town that you had left were streets still haunted by your voice. There was your worn tread upon the pavement, there the tavern table dented where you banged your tankard down. And in the evening, when the ships were gone, men waited for your return.",1
4653,"But no return is here among us in America. Here are no streets still haunted by departed men. Here is no street at all, as you knew streets. Here are just our cement Mobways, unannealed by time! No place in Mobway bids you pause, old Drake. No spot in Mob-way bids you hold your mind a moment in reflection, saying: ""He was here! No square of concrete slab says: ""Stay, for I was built by men. Mobway never knew the hand of man, as your streets did. Mobway was laid down by great machines, for one sole purpose--to unimpede and hurry up the passing of the feet.",1
4654,"Where did Mobway come from? What produced it? It came from the same place where all our mobways come from--from Standard Concentrated Production Units of America, No. 1. This is where all our streets, sidewalks, and lamp-posts (like the one on which Green's brains are spattered) come from, where all our white-grimy bricks (like those of which your hotel is constructed) come from, where the red facades of our standard-unit tobacco stores (like the one across the street) come from, where our motor-cars come from, where our drug-stores and our drug-store windows and displays come from, where our soda fountains (complete, with soda jerkers attached) come from, where our cosmetics, toilet articles, and the fat, rouged lips of our Jewesses come from, where our soda water, slops and syrups, steamed spaghetti, ice-cream, and pimento sandwiches come from, where our clothes, our hats (neat, standard stamps of grey), our faces (also stamps of grey, not always neat), our language, conversation, sentiments, feelings, and opinions come from. All these things are made for us by Standard Concentrated Production Units of America, No. 1.",1
4655,"So here we are, then, Admiral Drake. You see the street, the sidewalk, the front of your hotel, the constant stream of motor-cars, the drug-store and the soda fountain, the tobacco store, the traffic lights, the cops in uniform, the people streaming in and out of the subway, the rusty, pale-hued jungle of the buildings, old and new, high and low. There is no better place to see it, Drake. For this is Brooklyn--which means ten thousand streets and blocks like this one. Brooklyn, Admiral Drake, is the Standard Concentrated Chaos No. 1 of the Whole Universe. That is to say, it has no size, no shape, no heart, no joy, no hope, no aspiration, no centre, no eyes, no soul, no purpose, no direction, and no anything--just Standard Concentrated Units everywhere--exploding in all directions for an unknown number of square miles like a completely triumphant Standard Concentrated Blot upon the Face of the Earth. And here, right in the middle--no, that is wrong, for Standard Concentrated Blots don't have a middle--but, if not in the middle, at least right slap-bang out in the open, upon a minute portion of his magnificent Standard Concentrated Blot, where all the Standard Concentrated Blotters can stare at him, and with the brains completely out of him----  --Lies Green!",1
4656,"And this is bad--most bad--oh, very bad--and should not be allowed! For, as our young Jewish friend has just indignantly proclaimed, it ""shows no consideration for other people""--which means, for other Standard Concentrated Blotters. Green has no right to go falling in this fashion in a public place. He has no right to take unto himself any portion of this Standard Concentrated Blot, however small. He has no business being where he is at all. A Standard Concentrated Blotter is not supposed to be places, but to go places.",1
4657,"You see, dear Admiral, this is not a street to amble in, to ride along, to drift through. It is a channel--in the words of the Standard Concentrated Blotter-Press, an ""artery"". This means that it is not a place where one drives, but a place where one is driven--not really a street at all, but a kind of tube for a projectile, a kind of groove for millions and millions of projectiles, all driven past incessantly, all beetling onwards, bearing briefly white slugged blurs of driven flesh.",1
4658,"As for the sidewalk, this Standard Concentrated Mobway is not a place to walk on, really. (Standard Concentrated Blotters have forgotten how to walk.) It is a place to swarm on, to weave on, to thrust and dodge on, to scurry past on, to crowd by on. It is not a place to stand on, either. One of the earliest precepts in a Concentrated Blotter's life is: ""Move on there! Where th' hell d'you think you are, anyway--in a cow pasture? And, most certainly, it is not a place to lie on, to sprawl out on.",1
4659,But look at Green! Just look at him! No wonder the Jewish youth is angry with him!,1
4660,"Green has wilfully and deliberately violated every Standard Concentrated Principle of Blotterdom. He has not only gone and dashed his brains out, but he has done it in a public place--upon a piece of Standard Concentrated Mobway. He has messed up the sidewalk, messed up another Standard Concentrated Blotter, stopped traffic, taken people from their business, upset the nerves of his fellow Blotters--and now lies there, all sprawled out, in a place where he has no right to be. And, to make his crime unpardonable, C. Green has----  --Come to Life!  Consider that, old Drake!",1
4661,"We can understand some measure of your strangeness, because we heard you swearing in the tavern and saw your sails stand to the west. Can you now do the same for us? Consider strangeness, Drake--and look at Green! For you have heard it said by your own countryman, and in your living generation: ""The times have been that, when the brains were out, the man would die. But now, old Drake, what hath Time wrought? There is surely here some strangeness in us that you could never have foretold. For the brains are ""out"" now--and the man has----  --Come to Life!",1
4662,"What's that, Admiral? You do not understand it? Small wonder, though it's really very simple:  For just ten minutes since, C. Green was a Concentrated Blotter like the rest of us.",1
4663,"Ten minutes since, he, too, might hurry in and out of the subway, thrust and scurry on the pavement, go hurtling past with whited blur in one of our beetles of machinery, a nameless atom, cypher, cinder, swarming with the rest of us, just another ""guy"" like a hundred million other ""guys"". But now, observe him! No longer is he just ""another guy""--already he has become a ""special guy""--has become ""The Guy"". C. Green at last has turned into a--Man!  Four hundred years ago, brave Admiral Drake, if we had seen you lying on your deck, your bronze gone pale and cold, imbrued in your own blood, and hewn to the middle by the Spaniards' steel, we could have understood that, for there was blood in you.",1
4664,"But Green--this Concentrated Blotter of ten minutes since--made in our own image, shaped in our own dust, compacted of the same grey stuff of which our own lives are compacted, and filled, we thought, with the same Standard Concentration of embalming fluid that fills our veins--oh, Drake, we did not know the fellow had such blood in him! We could not have thought it was so red, so rich, and so abundant!  Poor, shabby, and corrupted cypher!",1
4665,"Poor, nameless, and exploded atom! Poor little guy! He fills us Concentrated Blotters of the Universe with fear, with shame, with awe, with pity, and with terror--for we see ourselves in him. If he was a man with blood in him, then so are we! If he, in the midst of his always-driven life, could at last be driven to this final and defiant gesture of refusal to remain a Concentrated Blotter, then we, too, might be driven to a point of equal desperation! And there are other methods of defiance, other ways of ultimate refusal, other means of exercising one's last-remaining right of manhood--and some of them are no less terrifying to contemplate than this! So our fascinated eyes go up and up, past floor after floor of Standard Concentrated brick, and fasten on the open window where he stood--and suddenly we crane our necks along the ridges of our collars, look away with constricted faces, and taste the acrid bitterness of steel upon our lips!",1
4666,"It is too hard, and not to be endured--to know that little Green, speaking our own tongue and stuffed with our own stuffing, had yet concealed in him some secret, dark, and frightful thing more terrible than anything that we have ever known--that he bore within him some black and hideous horror, some depth of madness or of courage, and could stand there--upon the sheer and nauseating verge of that grey window-ledge for five full minutes--and know the thing he was about to do--and tell himself he must now!--that he had to!--that the compulsion of every horror-fascinated eye down in the gulf below had now made escape impossible--and then, horror-sick past all regeneration, see, too, before he jumped, his fall, the downward-hurtling plunge, and his own exploded body--feel the bones crack and fly apart, and the brutal obliteration of the instant when his brains would shoot out against the lamp-post--and even while his soul drew back from that sheer verge of imagined terror, shame, and unutterable self-loathing, crying: ""I cannot do it!""--then jumped! And we, brave Drake? We try to see it, but we cannot see. We try to fathom it, but we cannot plunge. We try to comprehend the hell of hells, the hundred lives of horror, madness, anguish, and despair that were exhausted in five minutes by that shabby creature crouched there on the window-ledge. But we cannot understand, or look at it any longer. It is too hard, too hard, and not to be endured. We turn away with nausea, hollowness, blind fear, and unbelief within us.",1
4667,"One man stares, cranes his neck, wets his lips, and whispers: ""Jesus! To do a thing like that takes guts!""  Another, harshly: ""Nah! It don't take guts! A guy who'd do a thing like that is crazy! He don't know what he's doin' to begin with!",1
4668,"And others, doubtfully, half-whispering, with eyes focused on the ledge: ""But Jesus! A taxi-driver, turning away and moving towards his cab, with an attempt at casual indifference that does not ring entirely true: ""Oh, well! Just another guy, I guess!",1
4669,"Then one man, turning to his companion with a little puckered smile: ""Well, what about it, Al? You still feel like eating? And his companion, quietly: ""Eating, hell! I feel like two or three stiff shots of rye! Come on, let's go round to Steve's!""  They go.",1
4670,"The Concentrated Blotters of the World cannot abide it. They must somehow blot it out. So a policeman comes round the corner now with an old tarpaulin, with which he covers the No-Head. The crowd remains. Then the green wagon from the morgue. The Thing, tarpaulin and all, is pushed into it. It drives away. A policeman with thick-soled boots scuffs and pushes skull-pieces and brain-fragments into the gutter. Someone comes with sawdust, strews it. Someone from the drugstore with formaldehyde. Later, someone with a hose and water. From the subway come an adolescent boy and girl with the hard, tough faces of the city; they walk past it, deliberately and arrogantly step among it, look at the lamp-post, then at each other, and laugh!",1
4671,"All's over now, all's gone, the crowd's departed. Something else remains. It cannot be forgotten. There's a sick, humid smell upon the air, what was light and clear and crystal has gone out of day, and something thick and glutinous--half taste, half smell, and all impalpable--remains upon your tongue.",1
4672,"There would have been a time and place for such a thing, brave Admiral Drake, if he, our fellow Green, had only fallen as a hollow man and landed dryly, or if he had opened to disperse a grey embalming fluid in the gutter. It would have been all right if he had just been blown away like an old paper, or if he had been swept aside like remnants of familiar litter, and then subsumed into the Standard Concentrated stuff from which he came. But C. Green would not have it so. He exploded to drench our common substance of viscous grey with the bright indecency of blood, to resume himself from number, to become before our eyes a Man, and to identify a single spot of all our general Nothingness with the unique passion, the awful terror, and the dignity of Death.",1
4673,"So, Admiral Drake--""an unidentified man fell 'or jumped yesterday at noon"" from a window of your own hotel. That was the news. Now you've had the story.",1
4674,"We are ""the hollow men, the hollow men""? Brave Admiral, do not be too sure. 30. The Anodyne Fox read it instantly, the proud nose sniffing upwards sharply--""man fell or jumped...Admiral Francis Drake Hotel...Brooklyn. The sea-pale eyes took it in at once, and went on to more important things.",1
4675,"Fox was cold, then? Hard? Selfish? Lacking in understanding? Unsympathetic? Unimaginative? By no means.",1
4676,"Could not have known Green, then? Was too much the patrician to know Green? Was too high, too rare, too subtle, too fine-fibred to know Green? None of these.",1
4677,"Fox knew everything, or almost everything. (If there's a lack here, we will smell it out.) Fox had been born with everything, and had learned much, yet his learning had not made him mad, or ever blunted the keen blade of knowing. He saw all things as they were: had never (in his mind and heart) called man a ""white man"" yet, because Fox saw man was not ""white man""--man was pink man tinged with sallow, man was sallow tinged with grey, man was pink-brown, red-bronze, or white-red-sallow, but not white.",1
4678,"So Fox (in mind and heart) would call it as it was. This was the boy's straight eye. Yet his clarities were obscured for other men. His straightness was thought cunning by crude-cunning rogues, his warmth seemed ice to all the hearty-false, and to the false-sincere Fox was a twister. Not one of these things was true of him.",1
4679,"Fox knew Green all right--knew him better than we, the Concentrated Blotters of Green's ilk. For, being of the ilk, we grow confused, struggle with Green (so with ourselves), argue, debate, deny, are tarred with the same brush, and so lose judgment. Not so, Fox. Not of Green's ilk, yet was he still of the whole family of earth. Fox knew at once that Green had blood in him. Fox placed him instantly: saw sky above him, Admiral Drake Hotel behind him, lamp-post, pavement, people, Brooklyn corner, cops, rouged Jewesses, the motor-cars, the subway entrance, and exploded brains--and, had he been there, would have said in a low, somewhat puzzled, and abstracted tone:",1
4680,"Oh...I see. Would have seen, too, my mad masters; never doubt it. Would have seen clearly and seen whole, without our agony, without confusion, without struggling with the surface of each brick, each square inch of concrete pavement, each scale of rust upon the fire-escapes, the raw-green paint of the lamp-post, the sterile red-front brightness of the cigar store, the shapes of windows, ledges, cornices, and doorways, the way the shops were set into old houses along the street, all the heart-sick ugliness exploded into the nothingness of Brooklyn. Fox would have seen it instantly, without having to struggle to see all, know all, hold all clearly, singly, permanently, in the burning crystal of the brain.",1
4681,"And if Fox had lived in Brooklyn, he would have got much else as well--got it clear and straight--while we were trying to make our maddened ears spread out like funnels to absorb it--every whispered word in Flatbush, every rhythmic-creaking spring in the back bedrooms of whore's Sand Street (by old yellow shades concealed), every barker's cry in Coney, all the jargons of each tenement from Red Hook to Brownsville. Yes, while we wrestled with our five senses there in Jungletown, our tormented brain caught in the brutal chaos of ""Gewirr! Gewirr!""--Fox would have got it all, without madness, agony, or the fevered eye, and would have murmured:",1
4682,"Oh...I see.  Wherever he was, Fox was one to get the little things--the little, most important things that tell you everything. He never picked a little thing because it was a little thing, to show he was a devilish cunning, subtle, rare, and most aesthetic fellow: he picked a little thing because it was the right thing--and he never missed.",1
4683,"Fox was a great fox, and a genius. He was no little Pixy of the Aesthetes. He did not write nine-page reviews on ""How Chaplin Uses Hands in Latest Picture""--how it really was not slap-stick, but the tragedy of Lear in modern clothes; or on how Enters enters; or on how Crane's poetry can only be defined, reviewed, and generally exposited in terms of mathematical formulae--ahem! ahem, now!--as:    _____________________",1
4684,"\/an pxt = n-F3(B18+ 11) --------   ------------    237           2 (Bring on the Revolution, Comrades; it is Time!) Fox did not go round making discoveries nine years after Boob McNutt had made them. He didn't find out that Groucho was funny seven years too late, and then inform the public why he was. He did not write: ""The opening Volte of the Ballet is the historic method amplified in history, the production of historic fullness without the literary cliché of the historic spate. He had no part in any of the fine horse-manure with which we have allowed ourselves to be bored, maddened, whiff-sniffed, hound-and-hornered, nationed, new-republicked, dialled, spectatored, mercuried, storied, anvilled, new-massed, new-yorkered, vogued, vanity-faired, timed, broomed, transitioned, and generally shat upon by the elegant, refined, and snobified Concentrated Blotters of the Arts. He had nothing to do with any of the doltish gibberings, obscene quackeries, phoney passions, and six-months-long religions of fools, joiners, and fashion-apes a trifle brighter and quicker on the uptake than the fools, joiners, and fashion-apes they prey upon. He was none of your little frankypanky, seldesey-weldesey, cowley-wowley, tatesy-watesy, hicksy-picksy, wilsony-pilsony, jolasy-wolasy, steiny-weiny, goldy-woldly, sneer-puss fellows. Neither, in more conventional guise, was he one of your groupy-croupy, cliquey-triquey, meachy-teachy devotobloato wire-pullers and back-scratchers of the world.",1
4685,"No, Fox was none of these. He looked at the whole thing, whatever it was, and got it straight, said slowly: ""Oh...I see,"" then like a fox would begin to pick up things round the edges. An eye here, a nose there, a cleft of lip, a length of chin elsewhere--and suddenly, with the frame of a waiter's face, he would see the grave, thought-lonely visage of Erasmus. Fox would turn away reflectively and drink his drink, glance casually from time to time as the man approached him, catch his coat lapels and turn, stare fixedly at the waiter's face again, turn back to the table, turn again and stare, bend over, staring right up into the waiter's face:  The waiter, troubled now, and smiling doubtfully: ""Sir?...Is there anything wrong, sir?""  Fox, slowly, almost in a whisper: ""Did you ever hear of--Erasmus?""  And the waiter, still smiling, but more doubtfully than ever: ""No sir.",1
4686,"And Fox, turning away and whispering hoarsely with astounded conviction: ""Simply astonishing! Or, again, it will be a hat-check girl at the place where he has lunch--a little tough-voiced, pert, hard-boiled girl. Fox will suddenly stop one day and look at her keenly with his sea-pale eyes, and will give her a dollar as he goes out.",1
4687,"But Fox,"" friends will protest, ""in God's name, why did you give that girl a dollar? But isn't she the nicest person? Fox will say, in a low and earnest whisper.",1
4688,"And they will stare at him in blank amazement. That girl! That little tough, gold-digging, hard-boiled--oh, well, what's the use? They give it up! Rather than shatter the illusions and wound the innocence of this trusting child, they'll hold their tongues and leave him to his dream.",1
4689,"And she, the little hard-boiled hat-check girl, in a hoarse, confiding tone to the other hat-check girl, excitedly: ""Say! Do you know that guy that comes in here every day for lunch--the queer one that always orders guinea-hen--an' that didn't usta wanna let us have his hat at all?""  The other, nodding: ""Sure, I know! He usta try to wear it w'ile he's eatin'! You awmost had to throw 'im down an' take it from 'im befoeh he'd letcha have it. She, rapidly, nodding: ""Yeah!",1
4690,"That's him! Then, lowering her voice to an excited whisper: ""Well, y'know, he's been givin' me a dollah tip every day for the last mont'! The other, staring, stunned: ""G'wan!",1
4691,"She: ""Honest t' Gawd! The other: ""Has he made any passes atcha yet?--any wisecracks?--any funny tawk? She, with a puzzled look in her eye: ""That's the funny paht of it--I can't make 'im out!",1
4692,"He 'tawks funny awright-- but--he don't mean what I thought he did. The first time he said somethin' I thought he was goin' t' be fresh. He comes up t' get his hat one day, an' stands lookin' at me with that funny look until I got the willies. So I says: 'So what!' 'Married?' he says--just like that. Just stands lookin' at me an' says: 'Married?'""  The other: ""Gee!",1
4693,"That was fresh! Eagerly: ""Well, go on--w'atcha say to 'im? W'atcha tell 'im? She: ""Well, I says to myse'f: 'Oh, ho!",1
4694,"I knew this was comin'! This dollah-a-day stuff can't keep up for ever! Well,' I thinks, 'you can't hang onto a good thing all yoeh life!'--so I decides to let 'im have it befoeh he has the chanct to staht gettin' funny. So I lies to 'im: 'Surer I says, an' looks 'im right in the eye--'I'm good an' married! Ain't you?' I thought that ought to hold 'im.""  The other: ""An' w'at did he say t' that?",1
4695,"She: ""He just stood lookin' at me with that funny look. Then he shook his head at me--as if I'd done somep'n--as if it was my fault--as if he was disgusted wit' me. ' Yes,' he says, an' gets his hat, an' leaves his dollah, an' walks out. Tie that one down! Well, I gets to thinkin' it oveh, an' I figure that next day he's goin' t' spring itstaht givin' me the old oil about how his wife don't undehstand 'im, or how he's not livin' wit' her an' how lonesome he is--an' how about it?--can't we get togetheh some night for dinneh? And number two, rapt: ""So w'at happens?",1
4696,"And she: ""When he comes to get his hat next day he just stands there lookin' at me for a long time in that funny way of his that used to get me noivous--as if I'd done somep'n--so I says again: 'So what?' An' he says in that funny voice--it's so low sometimes you can't handly hear it--he says: 'Any children?'--just like that! Gee, it was funny! It wasn't what I expected 'im t' say at all! I didn't know what t' say, so fine'ly I says: 'No.' So, wit' that, he just stands there lookin' at me, an' he shakes his head at me like he was disgusted wit' me for not havin' any. So then I gets sore, I forget I'm pot married--the way he shakes his head at me as if it was my fault for not havin' any children gets me good an' sore--an' I says to 'im: 'So what? What if I haven't? Have you?""  Number two, now fascinated: ""So w'at happens?",1
4697,"W'at does he tell yah?""  She: ""He stands lookin' at me an' says: 'Fiver--just like that. An' then he shakes his head again--'All women,' he says, as if he was disgusted wit' me--Like yourself,' he says. An' then he takes his hat, an' leaves his dollah, an' walks out! Number two, in an aggrieved tone: ""Say-y!",1
4698,"Who does he think he is, anyway? How does he get that way? That guy's pretty fresh, I'd say!",1
4699,"She: ""Well, I get to thinkin' about it an' I get sore. The noive of 'im, tawkin' about women like that! So the next day when he comes to get his hat I says: 'Listen,' I says, 'what's eatin' on you, anyway? What are yah--a woman-hatah or somep'n? Whatcha got against women, anyway? What'd they eveh do to you?' 'Nothing,' he says, 'nothing--except act like women!' Gee! The way he said that! An' stood there shakin' his head at me in that disgusted way like I'd done somep'n! He takes his hat then, leaves his dollah, an' goes out... So afteh that I decide t' kid 'im along a little, seein' he's not tryin' t' get funny wit' me. So every day afteh that I make some wisecrack about women, tryin' to get a rise out of 'im, but I neveh do! Say! You can't get a rise outa that guy! I've tried an' I know! He don't even know when you're tryin' t' get a rise out of 'im!... So then he stahts t' ast me questions about my husband--an' gee!--was I embarrassed? He ast me all kinds of questions about 'im--what did he do, an' how old was he, an' where did he come from, an' was his mother livin', an' what did he think about women? Gee! It usta keep me busy from one day to anotheh wonderin' what he was goin' to ast me next, an' what t' say to 'im...Then he stahted astin' me about my mother, an' my sisters an' brothers, an' what did they do, an' how old were they--an' I could tell 'im those because I knew the answers. Number two: ""An' you told 'im?",1
4700,"She: ""Sure. W'y not? Number two: ""Gee, Mary, y' shouldn't do that! You don't know th' guy! How do you know who he is?""  She, abstracted, in a softer tone: ""Oh, I don't know.",1
4701,"That guy's all right! With a little shrug: ""You know! You can always tell. Number two: ""Yeah, but all the same, y' neveh can tell!",1
4702,"You don't know anything about th' guy! I kid 'em along, but I neveh tell 'em anything.",1
4703,"She: ""Oh, sure. I know. I do the same. Only, it's diff'rent wit' this guy. Gee, it's funny! I musta told 'im awmost everything--all about mama, an' Pat, an' Tim, an' Helen--I guess he knows the history of the whole damn fam'ly now! I neveh tawked so much to a stranger befoeh in my whole life. But it's funny, he neveh seems to say anything himse'f. He just stands there an' looks at you, an' turns his head to one side as if he's listenin'--an' you spill the beans. When he's gone you realise you've done all the tawkin'. 'Listen,' I says to 'im the otheh day, 'you know everything else now, I've told you the truth about everything else, so I'll come clean on this, too--that wasn't true about me bein' married.' Gee! He was about to drive me nuts astin' a new question every day about my husband! 'I lied to you about that,' I says. 'I neveh was married. I haven't got a husband.' Number two, hungrily: ""So w'at does he say to that?""  She: ""Just looks at me an' says: 'So--what?'",1
4704,"Laughing: ""Gee, it was funny to hear 'im say that! I guess I taught it to 'im. He says it all the time now. But it's funny the way he says it--like he don't know exactly what it means. 'So--what?' he says. So I says: 'What d'you mean, so what? I'm tellin' you that I'm not married, like I said I was.' 'I knew that all the time,' he says. 'How did you know?' I says. 'How could you tell?' 'Because,' he says, an' shakes his head at me in that disgusted way--'because you're a woman!' Number two: ""Can you imagine that?",1
4705,"The noive of 'im! I hope you told 'im somep'n! She: ""Oh, sure! I always come right back at 'im! But still, you neveh can be sure he means it! I think he's kiddin' half the time. He may be kiddin' when he shakes his head at you in that disgusted way. Anyway, that guy's all right! I don't know, but somehow you can tell. A pause, then with a sigh: ""But gee! If only he'd go an' get himse'f a-----""  Number two: ""Hat!""  She: ""Can yah beat it?",1
4706,"Number two: ""Ain't it a scream?""  They regard each other silently, shaking their heads. Fox gets at all things round the edges in this way--sees the whole thing, whole, clear, instant, unperplexed, then all the little things as well. Will see a man in the crowd, notice the way his ear sticks out, his length of chin, his short upper lip, the way his face is formed, something about the cheek-bones--a man well dressed and well behaved, conventional in appearance, no one but the Fox would look a second time at him--and suddenly the Fox will find himself looking into the naked eyes of a wild animal. Fox will see the cruel and savage tiger prowling in that man, let loose in the great jungle of the city, sheathed in harmless and deceptive grey--a wild beast, bloody, rending, fierce, and murderous--and stalking free and unsuspected on the sheep of life! And Fox will turn away appalled and fascinated, look at the people all round him with astonishment--""Can't they see? Don't they know?""--then will return again and walk past the tiger with hands clutching coat lapels, will bend, crane his head, and stare fixedly into tiger's eye until tiger's eye, discovered and unguarded now, blazes back at Fox--and all the people, puzzled and perturbed, are staring at Fox, too. Like children, they don't know what to make of it: ""What does that guy see? And Fox, astounded: ""Can't they see?""  Sees all life foxwise, really: has acute animal perceptions--does not let concrete, brick, stone, skyscrapers, motor-cars, or clothes obscure the thing itself.",1
4707,"Finds the tiger looking out at life, and then sees all the people who are lions, bulls, mastiffs, terriers, bulldogs, greyhounds, wolves, owls, eagles, hawks, rabbits, reptiles, monkeys, apes, and--foxes. Fox knows the world is full of them. He sees them every day. He might have found one in C. Green, too--cat, rabbit, terrier, or snipe--could he have seen him.",1
4708,"He reads the news in this way, sniffing sharply, with keen relish, at the crisp, ink-pungent pages. He also reads the paper with a kind of eager hopelessness. Fox has no hope, really; he is beyond despair. (If there's a lack, we'll smell it out. Is this not one? Is this not a lack-American? Can Fox be wholly of us if he has no hope?) Fox really has no hope that men will change, that life will ever get much better. He knows the forms will change: perhaps new changes will bring better forms. The shifting forms of change absorb him--this is why he loves the news. Fox would give his life to keep or increase virtue--to save the savable, to grow the growable, to cure the curable, to keep the good. But for the thing unsavable, for life ungrowable, for the ill incurable, he has no care. Things lost in nature hold no interest for him.",1
4709,"Thus will grow grey at the temples, haggard-eyed, and thin if one of his children has an ailment. One daughter has been in a motor wreck, escapes unhurt apparently, days later has a slight convulsion. It comes a second time, returns weeks later, goes away, and comes again--not much, not long, just a little thing, but Fox grows grey with worry. He takes the girl from college, gets doctors, specialists, the best people in the world, tries everything, can find nothing wrong, yet the attacks continue; at length comes through it, finds out the trouble, pulls the girl out, and sees her married. His eyes are clear again. Yet if the girl had had a cureless ailment, Fox would not have worried much.",1
4710,"He goes home, sleeps soundly, seems indifferent, shows no worry, the night the daughter has a child. Next morning, when informed he is a grandfather, looks blank, puzzled, finally says: ""Oh""--then, turning away with a disdainful sniffing of the nose, says scornfully:  ""Another woman, I suppose?""  Informed it is a man-child, says: ""Oh,"" dubiously, then whispers contemptuously:  ""I had supposed such a phenomenon was impossible in this family.",1
4711,"And for some weeks thereafter persists in referring to his grandson as ""She"", to the indignation, resentment, excited protest of the--Women!  (A cunning Fox--knows slyly how to tease.) So, then, unhoping hopefulness, and resigned acceptance; patient fatality, and unflagging effort and unflinching will. Has no hope, really, for the end, the whole amount of things; has hope incessant for the individual things themselves. Knows we lose out all along the line, but won't give in. Knows how and when we win, too, and never gives up trying for a victory. Considers it disgraceful to stop trying--will try everything--will lay subtle, ramified, and deep-delved plans to save people from avertible defeat; a man of talent drowning in his own despair, some strong and vital force exploding without purpose, some precious, misused thing gone wickedly to ruin. These things can be helped, they must be helped and saved, to see them lost, to see them thrown away, is not to be endured--Fox will move mountains to prevent them. But gone? Lost? Destroyed? Irretrievably thrown away? The grave face will be touched with sadness, the sea-pale eyes filled with regret, the low voice hoarse and indignant:  ""It was a shame!",1
4712,A shame! Everything would have come out all right...he had it in his grasp...and he just let it go! He just gave in!,1
4713,"Yes, for failure such as this, a deep, indignant sadness, a profound regret. But for other things foreordained and inevitable, not savable by any means, then a little sadness--""Too bad""--but in the end a tranquil fatality of calm acceptance: the thing had to be, it couldn't be helped. Is therefore like Ecclesiastes: has the tragic sense of life, knows that the day of birth is man's misfortune--but, knowing this, will then ""lay hold"". Has never, like the Fool, folded his hands together and consumed his flesh, but, seeing work to be done, has taken hold with all his might and done it. Knows that the end of all is vanity, but says: ""Don't whine, and don't repine, but get work done. Is, therefore, not afraid to die; does not court death, but knows death is a friend.",1
4714,"Does not hate life, is rather passionately involved with life, yet does not hug it like a lover--it would not be torn bitterly from reluctant fingers. There is no desperate hug of mortality in Fox--rather, the sense of mystery and strangeness in the hearts of men, the thrilling interest of the human adventure, the unending fascination of the whole tangled, grieved, vexed, and unfathomed pattern. As he reads the Times now, he sniffs sharply, shakes his head, smiles, scans the crowded columns of the earth, and whispers to himself:  ""What a world!",1
4715,"And what a life! Will we ever get to the bottom of it all?... And what a time we live in! I don't dare go to sleep at night without the paper. I cannot wait until the next one has come out--things change so fast, the whole world's in such a state of flux, the course of history may change from one edition to another. The whole thing's so fascinating, I wish I could live a hundred years to see what's going to happen! If it weren't for that--and for the children----""  A slow perplexity deepens in his eyes.",1
4716,"What will become of them? Five tender lambs to be turned loose out of the fold into the howling tumults of this dangerous and changeful earth. Five fledglings to be sent forth, bewildered and defenceless, to meet the storms of fury, peril, adversity, and savage violence that beat across the whole vexed surface of the earth--unsheltered, ignorant, unprepared, and----  ""Women.",1
4717,"Scorn, touched now deeply with compassion; trouble, with a tender care. Is there a way out, then? Yes, if only he can live to see each of them married to--to--to a good husband (the sense of trouble deepens in the sea-pale eyes--the world in printed columns there before him seethes with torment--no easy business)... But to find good husbands, foxes all of them--to see his fleecelings safely folded, shielded from the storms--each--each with fleecelings of her own--yeslthat's the thing! Fox clears his throat and rattles the pages with decision. That's the thing for----  --Women!",1
4718,"--To be folded, sheltered, guarded, kept from all the danger, violence, and savagery, the grimed pollution of this earth's coarse thumb, each to ply her needle, learn to keep her house, do a woman's work, be wifely, and--and--""lead the sort of life a woman ought to lead,"" Fox whispers to himself--""the kind of life she was intended for. Which is to say, produce more fleecelings for the fold, Fox? Who will, in turn, find ""good"" husbands, and a fold, learn sewing, housewifery, and ""lead the sort of life a woman ought to lead,"" produce still other fleecelings, and so on, ad infinitum, to world's end for ever, or until----  --The day of wrath, the huge storm howling through the earth again--again the Terror and Jemappes I--again November and Moscow!--the whole flood broke through, the mighty river re-arisen, the dark tide flowing in the hearts of men, and a great wind howling through the earth, good Fox, that tears off roof-tops like a sheet of paper, bends the strongest oak-trees to the ground, knocks down the walls, and levels the warmest, strongest, and most solid folds that ever sheltered fleecelings in security--leaving fleecelings where?  O Fox, is there no answer?",1
4719,"Leaving fleecelings there to knit a pattern of fine needlework on the hurricane? Leaving fleecelings there to ply housewifery on the flood? Leaving fleecelings to temper the bleak storms of misery to the perfumed tenderness of fleeceling hides? To find ""good"" husbands in the maelstrom's whirl? To produce more fleecelings in order to be secure, protected, in doing a woman's work, in leading ""the kind of life she was intended for""----  Oh, where, Fox, where?",1
4720,"--To draw compassion from the cobble-stones? Security from iron skies? Solicitude from the subduer's bloody hand? Arthurian gallantries from the brutal surge of the on-marching mass? Still no answer, subtle Fox?",1
4721,"What, then? Will not hoarse voices fogged with blood and triumph soften to humility when they behold the fleeceling loveliness? And while the blind mob fills the desolated streets, will not a single cloak be thrown down for dainty fleeceling feet to tread upon? Will the shattered masonries of all those (as we thought) impregnable securities, with which the Foxes of the world have sheltered fleecelings, no longer give the warmth and safety which once were so assured and certain? And must those fountains so unfailing in the flow of milk and honey, on which fleecelings feed, be withered at their source? Must they be fountains, rather, dyed with blood--blood of the lamb, then? Fleeceling blood?",1
4722,"O Fox, we cannot think of it! Fox reads on, intent, with the keen hunger of a fascinated interest, the shade of a deep trouble in his eye. The sober, close-set columns of the Times give up their tortured facts, revealing a world in chaos, man bewildered, life in chains. These substantial rages, so redolent of morning and sobriety--of breakfast in America, the pungency of ham and eggs, the homes of prosperous people--yield a bitter harvest of madness, hatred, dissolution, misery, cruelty, oppression, injustice, despair, and the bankruptcy of human faith. What have we here, mad masters?--for surely if ye be masters of such hell-on-earth as sober Times portrays, then ye be mad!",1
4723,"Well, here's a little item:  It is announced, my masters, that on Saturday next, in the Land of the Enchanted Forest, land of legends and the magic of the elves, land of the Venusberg and the haunting beauties of the Gothic towns, land of the truth-lover and the truth-seeker, land of the plain, good, common, vulgar, and all-daring Sense of Man, land where the great monk nailed his blunt defiance to the doors at Wittenberg, and broke the combined powers, splendours, pomps, and menaces of churchly Europe with the sledge-hammer genius of his coarse and brutal speech--land from that time onwards of man's common noble dignity, and of the strong truth of sense and courage, shaking its thick fist into the face of folly--yes! land of Martin Luther, land of Goethe, land of Faust, land of Mozart and Beethoven--land where immortal music was created, glorious poetry written, and philosophy cultivated--land of magic, mystery, matchless loveliness, and unending treasure-hordes of noble art--land where the Man of Weimar, for the last time in the modern world, dared to make the whole domain of art, culture, and learning the province of his gigantic genius--land, too, of noble, consecrated youth, where young men sang and wrote, loved truth, went through apprenticeships devoted to the aspiration of a high and passionate ideal--well, mad masters, it is announced that this same enchanted land will consecrate the devotion of another band of youth this Saturday--when the young men of the nation will burn books before the Town Halls, in all the public squares of Germany! Well, then, Fox?",1
4724,"And elsewhere on this old tormented globe, goes it much better? Fire, famine, flood, and pestilence--these trials we have always had. And hatred--most firelike, faminelike, floodlike, and most pestilential of all evils--yes, we have always had that, too. And yet, Great God! When has our old unhappy earth been stricken with such universal visitation? When has she ached in every joint as she aches now? When has she had such a universal itch, been so spavined, gouty, poxy, so broken out in sores all over?",1
4725,"The Chinese hate the Japanese, the Japanese the Russians, the Russians also hate the Japanese, and the hordes of India the English. The Germans hate the French, the French hate the Germans, and then look wildly round to find other nations to help them hate the Germans; but find they hate almost everyone as much as they hate Germans; they can't find enough to hate outside of France, and so divide themselves into thirty-seven different cliques and hate each other bitterly from Calais to Menton--the Leftists hate Rightists, the Centrists hate Leftists, the Royalists hate Socialists, the Socialists hate Communists, the Communists hate Capitalists, and all unite in hatred of one another. In Russia, the Stalinites hate Trotskyites, the Trotskyites hate Stalinites, and both hate Republicans and Democrats. Everywhere the Communists (so they say) hate their cousin Fascists, and the Fascists hate the Jews.",1
4726,"In this year of Our Gentle Lord 1934, ""expert"" observers say, Japan is preparing to go to war again with China within two years, Russia will join in with China, Japan will ally herself with Germany, Germany will make a deal with Italy, and then make war on France and England, America will try to stick her head into the sand, and so keep out of it, but will find it cannot be done and will be drawn in. And in the end, after everybody has fought everybody else up and down the globe, the whole Capitalistic world will join up finally against Russia in an effort to crush Communism--which eventually must win--will lose--is bound to triumph--will be wiped out--will supplant Capitalism, which is on its last legs--which is only suffering a temporary relapse--which grows more dropsical, greedy, avaricious, bloated, and monopolistic all the time--which is mending its ways and growing better all the time--which must be preserved at all costs if the ""American System"" is to endure--which must be destroyed at all costs if America is to endure--which is just beginning--which is ending--which is gone already--which will never go---- And so it goes--round, round, round the tortured circumference of this aching globe--round, round, and back again, and up and down, with stitch and counterstitch until this whole earth and all the people in it are caught up in one gigantic web of hatred,' greed, tyranny, injustice, war, theft, murder, lying, treachery, hunger, suffering, and devilish error!",1
4727,"And we, old Fox? How goes it in our own fair land--our great America? Fox winces quickly, cranes his neck into his collar, and mutters hoarsely a passionate regret:  ""Too bad!",1
4728,"Too bad! We should have had it! We were just beginning--we should have had it fifty years ago, as Rome had it, and as England had it! But all this turmoil came too soon--we didn't have it long enough! Too bad! Too bad!",1
4729,"Yes, Fox, it is too bad. Too bad, indeed, that in our pride, our self-respect, and our taut horror the Medusa-visage of the whole tormented earth may be an anodyne for us, lest we have to look too closely at the honour of our own America. 31. The Promise of America For four years George Webber lived and wrote in Brooklyn, and during all this time his life was about as solitary as any that a modern man can know. Loneliness, far from being a rare and curious circumstance, is and always has been the central and inevitable experience of every man. Not only has this been true of the greatest poets, as evidenced by the huge unhappiness of their published grief, but now it seemed to George to apply with equal force to all the nameless cyphers who swarmed about him in the streets. As he saw them in their strident encounters with each other, and overheard their never-varying exchanges of abuse, contempt, distrust, and hatred, it became increasingly clear to him that one of the contributing causes of their complaint was loneliness.",1
4730,"To live alone as George was living, a man should have the confidence of God, the tranquil faith of a monastic saint, the stern impregnability of Gibraltar. Lacking these, he finds that there are times when anything, everything, all and nothing, the most trivial incidents, the most casual words, can in an instant strip him of his armour, palsy his hand, constrict his heart with frozen horror, and fill his bowels with the grey substance of shuddering impotence and desolation. Sometimes it would be a sly remark dropped by some all-knowing literary soothsayer in the columns of one of the more leftish reviews, such as:  ""Whatever has become of our autobiographical and volcanic friend, George Webber?",1
4731,"Remember him? Remember the splash he made with that so-called 'novel' of his a few years back? Some of our esteemed colleagues thought they detected signs of promise there. We ourselves should have welcomed another book from him, just to prove that the first was not an accident. But tempus fugit, and where is Webber? Calling Mr. Webber! No answer? Well, a pity, perhaps; but then, who can count the number of one-book authors? They shoot their bolt, and after that they go into the silence and no more is heard from them. Some of us who were more than a little doubtful about that book of Webber's, but whose voices were drowned out by the Oh's and Ah's of those who rused headlong to proclaim a new star rising in the literary firmament, could now come forward, if we weren't too kindly disposed towards our more emotional brethren of the critical fraternity, and modestly say: 'We told you so!' Sometimes it would be nothing but a shadow passing on the sun, sometimes nothing but the gelid light of March falling on the limitless, naked, sprawling ugliness and squalid decencies of Brooklyn streets.",1
4732,"Whatever it was, at such a time all joy and singing would go instantly out of day, Webber's heart would drop out of him like a leaden plummet, hope, confidence, and conviction would seem lost for ever to him, and all the high and shining truth that he had ever found and lived and known would now turn false to mock him. Then he would feel like one who walked among the dead, and it would be as if the only things that were not false on earth were the creatures of the death-in-life who moved for ever in the changeless lights and weathers of red, waning, weary March and Sunday afternoon. These hideous doubts, despairs, and dark confusions of the soul would come and go, and George knew them as every lonely man must know them. For he was united to no image save that image which he himself created. He was bolstered by no knowledge save that which he gathered for himself out of his own life. He saw life with no other vision save the vision of his own eyes and brain and senses. He was sustained and cheered and aided by no party, was given comfort by no creed, and had no faith in him except his own.",1
4733,"That faith, though it was made up of many articles, was at bottom a faith in himself, a faith that if he could only succeed in capturing a fragment of the truth about the life he knew, and make it known and felt by others, it would be a more glorious accomplishment than anything else he could imagine. And through it all, animating this faith and sustaining it with a promise of rewards to come, was a belief--be it now confessed--that if he could only do this, the world would thank him for it, and would crown him with the laurel of its fame. The desire for fame is tooted in the hearts of men. It is one of the most powerful of all human desires, and perhaps for that very reason, and because it is so deep and secret, it is the desire that men are most unwilling to admit, particularly those who feel most sharply its keen and piercing spur.",1
4734,"The politician, for example, would never have us think that it is love of office, the desire for the notorious elevation of public place, that drives him on. No, the thing that governs him is his pure devotion to the common weal, his selfless and high-minded statesmanship, his love of his fellow-man, and his burning idealism to turn out the rascal who usurps the office and betrays the public trust which he himself, as he assures us, would so gloriously and devotedly maintain. So, too, the soldier. It is never love of glory that inspires him to his profession. It is never love of battle, love of war, love of all the resounding titles and the proud emoluments of the heroic conqueror. Oh, no. It is devotion to duty that makes him a soldier. There is no personal motive in it. He is inspired simply by the selfless ardour of his patriotic abnegation. He regrets that he has but one life to give for his country.",1
4735,"So it goes through every walk of life. The lawyer assures us that he is the defender of the weak, the guardian of the oppressed, the champion of the rights of defrauded widows and beleaguered orphans, the upholder of justice, the unrelenting enemy, at no matter what cost to himself, of all forms of chicanery, fraud, theft, violence, and crime. Even the business man will not admit a selfish motive in his money-getting. On the contrary, he is the developer of the nation's resources. He is the benevolent employer of thousands of working men who would be lost and on the dole without the organising genius of his great intelligence. He is the defender of the American ideal of rugged individualism, the shining exemplar to youth of what a poor country boy may achieve in this nation through a devotion to the national virtues of thrift, industry, obedience to duty, and business integrity. He is, he assures us, the backbone of the country, the man who makes the wheels go round, the leading citizen, Public Friend No. 1.",1
4736,"All these people lie, of course. They know they lie, and everyone who hears them also knows they lie. The lie, however, has become a part of the convention of American life. People listen to it patiently, and if they smile at it, the smile is weary, touched with resignation and the indifferent dismissals of fatigue.",1
4737,"Curiously enough, the lie has also invaded the world of creation--the one place where it has no right at all to exist. There was a time when the poet, the painter, the musician, the artist of whatever sort, was not ashamed to confess that the desire for fame was one of the driving forces of his life and labour. But what a transformation from that time to this! Nowadays one will travel far and come back fruitless if he hopes to find an artist who will admit that he is devoted to anything except the service of some ideal--political, social, economic, religious, or aesthetic--which is outside himself, and to which his own humble fame-forsaking person is reverently and selflessly consigned.",1
4738,"Striplings of twenty assure us that the desire for fame is naively childish, the fruit of an outworn cult of ""romantic individualism"". From all the falseness and self-deception of this cult these young gentlemen tell us they are free--without troubling to explain, however, by what process of miraculous purgation they achieved their freedom. It took Goethe, the strongest soul of modern times, some three and eighty years to free his mighty spirit of this last infirmity. Milton, old and blind, forsaken, and past fifty, is said to have won free of it by the end of Cromwell's revolution, in whose employment he destroyed his sight. And yet, can we be sure that even he was ever wholly clear, for what is the tremendous edifice of Paradise Lost except a man's final and triumphant suit against eternity?  Poor, blind Milton!",1
4739,"Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise (That last infirmity of Noble mind) To scorn delights, and live laborious dayes; But the fair Guerdon when we hope to find, And think to burst out into sudden blaze, Comes the blind Fury with th'abhorred shears, And slits the thin-spun life. But not the praise, Phoebus repli'd, and touch'd my trembling ears; Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil, Nor in the glistering foil Set off to th'world, nor in broad rumour lies, But lives and spreds aloft by those pure eyes, And perfet witnes of all judging Jove; As he pronounces lastly on each deed, Of so much fame in Heav'n expect thy meed. Deluded man! Poor vassal of corrupted time! How fair a thing for us to know that we are not such men as he and Goethe were! We live in more stirring times, and our very striplings are secure in their collective selflessness. We have freed ourselves of all degrading vanities, choked off the ravening desire for individual immortality, and now, having risen out of the ashes of our father's earth into the untainted ethers of collective consecration, we are clear at last of all that vexed, corrupted earth--clear of the sweat and blood and sorrow, clear of the grief and joy, clear of the hope and fear and human agony of which our father's flesh and that of every other man alive before us was ever wrought.",1
4740,"And yet, having achieved this glorious emancipation; having laid all petty dreams aside; having learned to think of life, not in terms of ourselves, but in terms of the whole mass; having learned to think of life, not as it is to-day, but as it is going to be five hundred years from now, when all the revolutions have been made, and all the blood has been shed, and all the hundreds of millions of vain and selfish little lives, each concerned with its own individual and romantic breath, have been ruthlessly wiped out in order to usher in the collective glory that such will be--having become marvellously and, as it were, overnight such paragons of collective selflessness and such scorners of the vanity of personal fame, is it not strange that though we have new phrases, yet their meaning is still the same? Is it not strange that, feeling only an amused and pitying contempt for those who are still naive enough to long for glory, we should yet lacerate our souls, poison our minds and hearts, and crucify our spirits with bitter and rancorous hatred against those who are fortunate enough to achieve fame? Or do we err? Are we mistaken in assuming that these words we read so often are really words of hatred, malice, envy, ridicule, and jeering mockery? Are we mistaken in assuming that the whole vocabulary of abuse which is exhausted every week in the journals of our red and pink-complexioned comrades--the sneers against a man's talent, the bitter denials that his work has any substance, sincerity, truth, or reality whatever--is really what it seems to be? No doubt we are mistaken. It would be more charitable to believe that these pure spirits of the present day are what they say they are--collective, selfless, consecrated--and that the words they use do not mean what they seem to mean, and do not betray the romantic and deluded passions that seem to animate them, but are really words used coldly, without passion, for the purposes of collective propaganda--in operations completely surgical, whereby the language of the present day, with all its overtones of superstition, prejudice, and false knowledge, is employed clinically, scientifically, simply to further the Idea of the Future State!",1
4741,"No more, no more! Of what avail to crush these vermin beneath our heavy boot? The locusts have no king, and lice will multiply for ever. The poet must be born, and live, and sweat, and suffer, and change, and grow, yet somehow maintain the changeless selfhood of his soul's integrity among all the crawling fashions of this world of lice. The poet lives, and dies, and is immortal; but the eternal trifler of all complexions never dies. The eternal trifler comes and goes, sucks blood of living men, is filled and emptied with the surfeit of each changing fashion. He gorges and disgorges, and is never fed. There is no nurture in him, and he draws no nurture from the food he feeds on. There is no heart, no soul, no blood, no living faith in him: the eternal trifler simply swallows and remains.",1
4742,"And we? Made of our father's earth, blood of his blood, bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh--born like our father here to live and strive, here to win through or be defeated--here, like all the other men who went before us, not too nice or dainty for the uses of this earth--here to live, to suffer, and to die-O brothers, like our fathers in their time, we are burning, burning, burning in the night. Go, seeker, if you will, throughout the land and you will find us burning in the night.",1
4743,"There where the hackles of the Rocky Mountains blaze in the blank and naked radiance of the moon, go make your resting stool upon the highest peak. Can you not see us now? The continental wall juts sheer and flat, its huge black shadow on the plain, and the plain sweeps out against the East, two thousand miles away. The great snake that you see there is the Mississippi River.",1
4744,"Behold the gem-strung towns and cities of the good, green East, flung like star-dust through the field of night. That spreading constellation to the north is called Chicago, and that giant wink that blazes in the moon is the pendant lake that it is built upon. Beyond, close-set and dense as a clenched fist, are all the jewelled cities of the eastern seaboard. There's Boston, ringed with the bracelet of its shining little towns, and all the lights that sparkle on the rocky indentations of New England. Here, southward and a little to the west, and yet still coasted to the sea, is our intensest ray, the splintered firmament of the towered island of Manhattan. Round about her, sown thick as grain, is the glitter of a hundred towns and cities. The long chain of lights there is the necklace of Long Island and the Jersey shore. Southward and inland, by a foot or two, behold the duller glare of Philadelphia. Southward farther still, the twin constellations--Baltimore and Washington. Westward, but still within the borders of the good, green East, that night-time glow and smoulder of hell-fire is Pittsburgh. Here, St. Louis, hot and humid in the cornfield belly of the land, and bedded on the mid-length coil and fringes of the snake. There at the snake's mouth, southward six hundred miles or so, you see the jewelled crescent of old New Orleans. Here, west and south again, you see the gemmy glitter of the cities on the Texas border.  Turn now, seeker, on your resting stool atop the Rocky Mountains, and look another thousand miles or so across moon-blazing fiend-worlds of the Painted Desert and beyond Sierras' ridge.",1
4745,"That magic congeries of lights there to the west, ringed like a studded belt round the magic setting of its lovely harbour, is the fabled town of San Francisco. Below it, Los Angeles and all the cities of the California shore. A thousand miles to north and west, the sparkling towns of Oregon and Washington.",1
4746,"Observe the whole of it, survey it as you might survey a field. Make it your garden, seeker, or your backyard patch. Be at ease in it. It's your oyster--yours to open if you will. Don't be frightened, it's not so big now, when your footstool is the Rocky Mountains. Reach out and dip a hatful of cold water from Lake Michigan. Drink it--we've tried it--you'll not find it bad. Take your shoes off and work your toes down in the river oozes of the Mississippi bottom--it's very refreshing on a hot night in the summer-time. Help yourself to a bunch of Concord grapes up there in northern New York State--they're getting good now. Or raid that water-melon patch down there in Georgia. Or, if you like, you can try the Rockyfords here at your elbow, in Colorado. Just make yourself at home, refresh yourself, get the feel of things, adjust your sights, and get the scale. It's your pasture now, and it's not so big--only three thousand miles from east to west, only two thousand miles from north to south--but all between, where ten thousand points of light prick out the cities, towns, and villages, there, seeker, you will find us burning in the night.",1
4747,"Here, as you pass through the brutal sprawl, the twenty miles of rails and rickets, of the South Chicago slums--here, in an unpainted shack, is a Negro boy, and, seeker, he is burning in the night. Behind him is a memory of the cotton-fields, the flat and mournful pineland barrens of the lost and buried South, and at the fringes of the pine another nigger shack, with mammy and eleven little niggers. Farther still behind, the slave-driver's whip, the slave ship, and, far off, the jungle dirge of Africa. And before him, what? A roped-in ring, a blaze of lights, across from him a white champion; the bell, the opening, and all round the vast sea-roaring of the crowd. Then the lightning feint and stroke, the black panther's paw--the hot, rotating presses, and the rivers of sheeted print! 0 seeker, where is the slave ship now?",1
4748,"Or there, in the clay-baked piedmont of the South, that lean and tan-faced boy who sprawls there in the creaking chair among admiring cronies before the open doorways of the fire department, and tells them how he pitched the team to shut-out victory to-day. What visions burn, what dreams possess him, seeker of the night? The packed stands of the stadium, the bleachers sweltering with their unshaded hordes, the faultless velvet of the diamond, unlike the clay-balked outfields down in Georgia. The mounting roar of eighty thousand voices and Gehrig coming up to bat, the boy himself upon the pitching mound, the lean face steady as a hound's; then the nod, the signal, and the wind-up, the rawhide arm that snaps and crackles like a whip, the small white bullet of the blazing ball, its loud report in the oiled pocket of the catcher's mitt, the umpire's thumb jerked upwards, the clean strike.",1
4749,"Or there again, in the East-Side Ghetto of Manhattan, two blocks away from the East River, a block away from the gas-house district and its thuggery, there in the swarming tenement, shut in its sweltering cell, breathing the sun-baked air through opened window at the fire-escape, celled there away into a little semblance of privacy and solitude from all the brawling and vociferous life and argument of his family and the seething hive round him, the Jew boy sits and pores upon his book. In shirt-sleeves, bent above his table to meet the hard glare of a naked bulb, he sits with gaunt, starved face converging to his huge beaked nose, the weak eyes squinting painfully through his thick-lens glasses, his greasy hair roached back in oily scrolls above the slanting cage of his painful and constricted brow. And for what? For what this agony of concentration? For what this hell of effort? For what this intense withdrawal from the poverty and squalor of dirty brick and rusty fire-escapes, from the raucous cries and violence and never-ending noise? For what? Because, brother, he is burning in the night. He sees the class, the lecture room, the shining apparatus of gigantic laboratories, the open field of scholarship and pure research, certain knowledge, and the world distinction of an Einstein name.",1
4750,"So, then, to every man his chance--to every man, regardless of his birth, his shining, golden opportunity--to every man the right to live, to work to be himself, and to become whatever thing his manhood and his vision can combine to make him--this seeker, is the promise of America. BOOK V. - EXILE AND DISCOVERY After four longyears in Brooklyn, George Webber came out of the wilderness, looked round him, and concluded he had had enough of it. During this period he had learned much, both about himself and about America, but now he was seized again with wanderlust. His life had always seemed to shift between the poles of anchored loneliness and foot-loose voyagings--between wandering for ever, and then the earth again--and now the old and restless urgings of ""Where shall we go? And what shall we do?"" again became insistent, would not down, and demanded of him a new answer.",1
4751,"Ever since his first book bad been published be had been looking for a way to form and shape his next. Now he thought that he had found it. It was not the way, perhaps, but it was a way. The hundreds and thousands of separate and disjointed notes that he had written down had fallen at last into a pattern in his mind. He needed only to weave them all together, and fill in the blanks, and he would have a book. He felt that be could do this final job of organisation and revision better if he made a clean break in the monotony 'of his life. New scenes, new faces, and new atmospheres might clear his head and sharpen his perspective.",1
4752,"It would be a good thing, too, to get away from America for a while. Too much was happening here--it was too exciting and disturbing. The whole thing was in such a state of flux, in such a prophetic condition of becoming, that the sheer exhilaration of watching it made it hard to concentrate upon the immediate job he had to do. Perhaps in the older civilisation of Europe, where life was fixed and certain, moulded by the heritage of centuries, there would be fewer distractions to keep him from his work. He decided to go abroad, to England, and there drop anchor, there find even keel in placid waters--there complete his book.",1
4753,"So in the late summer of 1934 he sailed from New York, went straight to London, took a flat, and settled down to hard, intensive labour. All through the autumn and winter of that year he lived in London in his self-imposed exile. It was a memorable time for him, a time during which, as he was later to realise, he discovered an entire new world. All the events, the experiences, and the people that he met became engraved indelibly upon his life.",1
4754,"And the event which exercised the most profound influence upon him in that alien air was his meeting with the great American author, Mr. Lloyd McHarg. Everything seemed to lead up to that. And what made his meeting with Mr. McHarg so important to him was that now, for the first time, he met a living embodiment of his own dearest and most secret dream. For when Mr. Lloyd McHarg swept like a cyclone through his life, George knew that he was having his first encounter in the flesh with that fair Medusa, Fame herself Never before had he beheld the lady, or witnessed the effects of her sweet blandishments. Now he saw the whole thing for himself.",1
4755,"32. The Universe of Daisy Purvis On arriving in London, George had the good fortune to sublet a flat in Ebury Street. The young military gentleman who condescended to let him have the place possessed one of those resounding double-jointed names that one comes across so often among the members of the upper or would-be-upper branches of English society. George was never able to get all the mouth-filling syllables of that grand name quite straight, but suffice it to say that his landlord was a Major Somebody Somebody Somebody Bixley-Dunton.",1
4756,"He was a good-looking man, tall, young, ruddy, with the lean and well-conditioned figure of a cavalryman. He was an engaging kind of fellow, too--so engaging that when he made the arrangements which permitted George to take over the premises, he managed to insinuate into his bill for rent a thumping sum that covered all the electricity and gas he had used in the preceding two quarters. And electricity and gas, as George was to discover, came high in London. You read and worked by one, sometimes not only through the night, but also through the pea-soup opacity of a so-called day. And you bathed and shaved and cooked and feebly warmed yourself by the other. George never did figure out just exactly how the engaging Major Bixley-Dunton did it, but he managed it so adroitly that George was half-way back to America some six months later before it dawned on his unsuspecting mind that he had occupied the modest dwelling only two quarters but had paid four whacking assessments for the whole year's gas and electricity.",1
4757,"George thought he was getting a bargain at the time, and perhaps he was. He paid Major Bixley-Dunton in quarterly instalments--in advance, of course--at the rate of two pounds ten shillings a week, and for this sum he had the advantage of being the sole occupant, at night at least, of a very small but distinctly authentic London house. It was really a rather tiny house, and certainly a very inconspicuous one, in a section noted for the fashionable spaciousness and magnificence of its dwellings. The building was three storeys tall, and George had the top floor. Below him a doctor had his offices, and the ground floor was occupied by a small tailor shop. These other tenants both lived elsewhere and were present only during the day, so at night George had the whole house to himself.",1
4758,"He had a good deal of respect for the little tailor shop. The venerable and celebrated Irish writer, Mr. James Burke, had his pants pressed there, and George had the honour of being present in the shop one night when the great man called for them. It was a considerable moment in Webber's life. He felt that he was assisting at an impressive and distinguished ceremony. It was the first time he had ever been in such intimate contact with such exalted literary greatness, and most fairminded people will agree that there are few things in the world more intimate than a pair of pants. Also, even at the moment that Mr. Burke entered the shop and demanded his trousers, George was requesting the return of his own. This homely coincidence gave him a feeling of perfectly delightful understanding and identity of purpose with a gentleman whose talents had for so many years been an object of his veneration. It gave him an easy and casual sense of belonging to the inner circle, and he could imagine someone saying to him:",1
4759,"Oh, by the way, have you seen anything of James Burke lately?""  ""Oh yes,"" he could nonchalantly reply, ""I ran into him the other day in the place where we both go to have our pants pressed.  And night after night as he worked in his sitting-room on the third floor, at that hour the solitary lord and master of that little house, toiling on the composition of a work which he hoped, but did not dare believe, might rival in celebrity some of James Burke's own, he would get at times the most curious and moving sense of companionship, as if a beneficent and approving spirit were there beneath that roof with him; and through the watches of the night it would speak to him with the eloquence of silence, saying:  ""Toil on, son, and do not lose heart or hope.",1
4760,"Let nothing you dismay. You are not utterly forsaken. I, too, am here--here in the darkness waiting, here attentive, here approving of your labour and your dream. Ever sincerely yours,  James Burke's Pants  One of the most memorable experiences of George Webber's six months in London was his relationship with Daisy Purvis.  Mrs. Purvis was a charwoman who lived at Hammersmith and for years had worked for ""unmarried gentlemen"" in the fashionable districts known as Mayfair and Belgravia.",1
4761,"George had inherited her, so to speak, from Major Bixley-Dunton, and when he went away he gave her back to him, to be passed on to the next young bachelor gentleman--a man, George hoped, who would be worthy of her loyalty, devotion, idolatry, and humble slavery. He had never had a servant in his life before. He had known Negro servants during his boyhood in the South; since then he had had people come in once or twice a week to clean up the various places where he had lived; but never before had he owned a servant body and soul, to the degree that her interests became his interests and her life his life; never before had he had anyone whose whole concern was the preservation of his comfort and welfare.",1
4762,"In appearance, Mrs. Purvis might have been the prototype of a whole class. She was not one of those comic figures so often pictured in the drawings of Belcher and Phil May, those pudgy old women who wear shawls and little Queen Victoria bonnets perched upon their heads, whose most appropriate locale seems to be the pub, and whom one actually does see in London pubs, sodden with beer and viciousness. Mrs. Purvis was a self-respecting female of the working class. She was somewhere in her forties, a woman inclined to plumpness, of middling height, fair-haired, blue-eyed, and pink-complexioned, with a pleasant, modest face, and a naturally friendly nature, but inclined to be somewhat do her dignity with strangers. At first, although she was at all times courteous, her manner towards her new employer was a little distant. She would come in in the morning and they would formally discuss the business of the day--what they were going to have for lunch, the supplies they were going to ""git in"", the amount of money it would be necessary to ""lay out"".",1
4763,"What would you like for lunch to-day, sir? Mrs. Purvis would say. 'Ave you decided?""  ""No, Mrs. Purvis.",1
4764,"What would you suggest? Let's see. We had the chump chop yesterday, didn't we, and the sprouts?""  ""Yes, sir,"" Mrs. Purvis would reply, ""and the day before--Monday, you may recall--we 'ad rump steak with potato chips.",1
4765,"Yes, and it was good, too. Well, then, suppose we have rump steak again?""  ""Very good, sir,"" Mrs. Purvis would say, with perfect courtesy, but with a rising intonation of the voice which somehow suggested, delicately and yet unmistakably, that he could do as he pleased, but mat she rather thought his choice was not the best. Feeling this, George would immediately have doubts. He would say:  ""Oh, wait a minute.",1
4766,"We've been having steak quite often, haven't we?""  ""You 'ave 'ad it quite a bit, sir,"" she would say quietly, not with reproof, but with just a trace of confirmation. Still, of course----"" She would not finish, but would pause and wait. Well, rump steak is good. All that we've had was first-rate. Still, maybe we could have something else to-day, for a change. What do you think? Should think so, sir, if you feel that way,"" she said quietly.",1
4767,"After all, one does like a bit of variety now and then, doesn't one?""  ""Of course. Well, then, what shall it be? What would you suggest, Mrs. Purvis?""  ""Well, sir, if I may say so, a bit of gammon and peas is rather nice sometimes,"" with just a trace of shyness and diffidence, mixed with an engaging tinge of warmth as she relented into the informality of mild enthusiasm.",1
4768,"I 'ad a look in at the butcher's as I came by this mornin', and the gammon was nice, sir. It was a prime bit, sir,"" she said now with genuine warmth. Prime.""  After this, of course, he could not tell her that he had not the faintest notion what gammon was.",1
4769,"He could only look delighted and respond:  ""Then, by all means, let's have gammon and peas. I think it's just the thing to-day. Very good, sir.",1
4770,"She had drawn herself up again; the formal intonation of the words had put her back within the fortress of aloofness, and had put him back upon his heels. It was a curious and disquieting experience, one that he was often to have with English people. Just when he thought that finally the bars were down and the last barriers of reserve broken through, just when they had begun to talk with mutual warmth and enthusiasm, these English would be back behind the barricade, leaving him to feel that it was all to do over again.",1
4771,"Now for your breakfast to-morrow mornin',"" Mrs. Purvis would continue. 'Ave you decided what you'd like?""  ""No, Mrs. Purvis. Have we anything on hand? How are our supplies holding out?""  ""They are a bit low, sir,"" she admitted.",1
4772,"We 'ave eggs. There is still butter left, and 'arf a loaf of bread. We're gittin' low on tea, sir. But you could 'ave eggs, sir, if you like. Something in the faint formality of the tone informed him that even though he might like to have eggs, Mrs. Purvis would not approve, so he said quickly:  ""Oh, no, Mrs. Purvis.",1
4773,"Get the tea, of course, but no more eggs. I think we've had too many eggs, don't you?""  ""You 'ave, sir, you know,"" she said gently--""for the last three mornin's, at any rate. Still-- Again she paused, as if to say that if he was determined to go on having eggs, he should have them.",1
4774,"Oh, no. We mustn't have eggs again. If we keep on at this rate, we'll get to the point where we can't look an egg in the face again, won't we?""  She laughed suddenly, a jolly and full-throated laugh.",1
4775,"We will, sir, won't we?"" said Mrs. Purvis, and laughed again. Excuse me for larfin', sir, but the way you put it, I 'ad to larf. It was quite amusin', really. Well, then, Mrs. Purvis, maybe you've got some ideas.",1
4776,"It's not going to be eggs, that's one thing sure. Well, sir, 'ave you tried kippers yet? Kippers are quite nice, sir,"" she went on, with another momentary mellowing into warmth. If you're lookin' for a change, you could do worse than kippers. Really you could, sir.""  ""Well, then, we'll have kippers.",1
4777,"They're the very thing. Very good, sir,"" She hesitated a moment and then said: ""About your supper, sir--I was thinkin'----""  ""Yes, Mrs. Purvis?""  ""It just occurred to me, sir, that, seein' as I'm not here at night to cook you a 'ot meal, we might lay in somethin' you could prepare for yourself. I was thinkin' the other day, sir, workin' as you do, you must get 'ungry in the middle of the night, so it wouldn't be a bad idea, would it, sir, if you could have somethin' on 'and?""  ""I think it would be a wonderful idea, Mrs. Purvis.",1
4778,"What do you have in mind? Well, sir,"" she paused briefly again, reflecting quietly, ""we might git in a bit of tongue, you know. A bit of cold tongue is very tasty. I should think you'd find it most welcome in the middle of the night. Or a bit of 'am. Then, sir, you would 'ave your bread and butter and your mustard pickle, and I could even git in a jar of chutney, if youlike, and you know 'ow to make tea yourself, don't you, sir?""  ""Of course.",1
4779,"It's a good idea. By all means, get in tongue or ham and chutney. Is that all, now?""  ""Well, sir,"" she reflected a moment longer, went to the buffet sideboard, opened it, and looked in.",1
4780,"I was just wonderin' 'ow you are for beer, sir...Ah-h,"" she exclaimed, nodding with satisfaction, ""it is gittin' a bit low, sir. You 'ave only two bottles left. Shall we lay in a 'arf-dozen bottles?""  ""Yes.",1
4781,"No--wait a minute. Better make it a dozen, then you won't have to be running out to order it again so soon. Very good, sir.",1
4782,"Again the formal rising intonation, this time, he thought, with approval. And what do you prefer, the Worthington or Bass?""  ""Oh, I don't know. Which is better?""  ""They're both first-rate, sir.",1
4783,"Some people prefer one kind and some another. The Worthington, perhaps is a trifle lighter, but you won't go wrong, sir, whichever one you order. All right, then, I'll tell you what you do--suppose you order half a dozen of each.",1
4784,"Very good, sir. She turned to go. Thank you, Mrs. Purvis. 'Kew,"" she said, most formally and distantly now, and went out quietly, closing the door gently but very firmly after her.",1
4785,"As the weeks went by, her excessive formality towards George began to thaw out and drop away. She became more and more free in communicating to him whatever was on her mind. Not that she ever forgot her ""place"". Quite the contrary. But, while always maintaining the instinctive manner of an English servant towards her master, she also became increasingly assiduous to her slavish attentions, until at last one would almost have thought that her duty towards him was her very life.",1
4786,"Her devotion, however, was not quite as whole and absolute as it appeared to be. For three or four hours of the day she had another master, who shared with George her service and her expense. This was the extraordinary little man who kept doctor's offices on the floor below. In truth, therefore, Mrs. Purvis had a divided loyalty, and yet, in a curious way, she also managed to convey to each of her employers a sense that her whole-souled obligation belonged to him, and to him alone.",1
4787,"The little doctor was a Russian of the old regime, who had been a physician at the court of the Czar, and had accumulated a large fortune, which of course had been confiscated when he fled the country during the revolution. Penniless, he had come to England, and had made another fortune by a practice about which Mrs. Purvis, with a kind of haughty aloofness mixed with loyalty, had invented a soothing little fiction, but concerning which the doctor himself became in time quite candid. From one o'clock in the afternoon until four or thereabouts, the door-bell tinkled almost constantly, and Mrs. Purvis was kept busy padding up and down the narrow stairs, admitting or ushering out an incessant stream of patients.",1
4788,"George had not been long in the place before he made a surprising discovery concerning this thriving practice. He and the little doctor had the same telephone, by a plug-in arrangement which permitted each to use the instrument in his own quarters while sharing the same number and the same bill. Sometimes the telephone would ring at night, after the doctor had departed for his home in Surrey, and George observed that the callers were always women. They would demand the doctor in voices that varied from accents of desperate entreaty to tones that fairly crooned with voluptuous and sensual complaint. Where was the doctor? When George informed them that he was at his home, some twenty miles away, they would moan that it couldn't be true, that it wasn't possible, that fate could assuredly not play them so cruel a joke. When told that it was indeed so, they would then sometimes suggest that perhaps George himself could render them some assistance on his own account. To these requests he was forced to reply, often with reluctance, that he was not a physician, and that they would have to seek help in some other quarter.",1
4789,"These calls sharpened his curiosity, and he began to keep his eye peeled during the doctor's office hours in the afternoon. He would go to the window and look out each time the door-bell rang, and in a little while he became convinced of what he had already begun to suspect, ""that the doctor's practice was devoted exclusively to women"". Their ages ranged from young womanhood to elderly haghood, they were of all kinds and conditions, but the one thing that was true of these patients was that they all wore skirts. No man ever rang that door-bell.",1
4790,"George would sometimes tease Mrs. Purvis about this unending procession of female visitors, and would openly speculate on the nature of the doctor's practice. She had a capacity for self-deception which one often encounters among people of her class, although the phenomenon is by no means confined to it. No doubt she guessed some of the things that went on below stairs, but her loyalty to anyone she served was so unquestioning that when Geprge pressed her for information her manner would instantly become vague, and she would confess that, although she was not familiar with the technical details of the doctor's practice, it was, she believed, devoted to ""the treatment of nervous diseases"".",1
4791,"Yes, but what kind of nervous diseases? George would ask. Don't the gentlemen ever get nervous, too?""  ""Ah-h,"" said Mrs. Purvis, nodding her head with an air of knowing profundity that was very characteristic of her.",1
4792,"Ah-h, there you 'ave it!""  ""Have what, Mrs. Purvis?""  ""'Ave the hanswer,"" she said. It's this Moddun Tempo. That's what Doctor says,"" she went on loftily, in that tone of unimpeachable authority with which she always referred to him and quoted his opinions. It's the pace of Moddun Life--cocktail parties, stayin' up to all hours, and all of that. In America, I believe, conditions are even worse,"" said Mrs. Purvis. Not, of course, that they really are,"" she added quickly, as if fearing that her remark might inadvertently have wounded the patriotic sensibilities of her employer. I mean, after all, not 'avin' been there myself, I wouldn't know, would I?""  Her picture of America, derived largely from the pages of the tabloid newspapers, of which she was a devoted reader, was so delightfully fantastic that George could never find it in his heart to disillusion her.",1
4793,"So he dutifully agreed that she was right, and even managed, with a few skilful suggestions, to confirm her belief that almost all American women spent their time going from one cocktail party to another--in fact, practically never got to bed. Ah, then,"" said Mrs. Purvis, nodding her head wisely with an air of satisfaction, ""then you know what this Moddun Tempo means! And, after a just perceptible pause: ""Shockin' I calls it!",1
4794,"She called a great many things shocking. In fact, no choleric Tory in London's most exclusive club could have been more vehemently and indignantly concerned with the state of the nation than was Daisy Purvis. To listen to her talk one might have thought she was the heir to enormous estates that had been chief treasures of her country's history since the days of the Norman conquerors, but which were now being sold out of her hands, cut up piece-meal, ravaged and destroyed because she could no longer pay the ruinous taxes which the government had imposed. She would discuss these matters long and earnestly, with dire forebodings, windy sighs, and grave shakings of the head.",1
4795,"George would sometimes work the whole night through and finally get to bed at six or seven o'clock in the dismal fog of a London morning. Mrs. Purvis would arrive at seven-thirty. If he was not already asleep he would hear her creep softly up the stairs and go into the kitchen. A little later she would rap at his door and come in with an enormous cup, smoking with a beverage in whose soporific qualities she had the utmost faith.",1
4796,"'Ere's a nice 'ot cup of Ovaltine,"" said Mrs. Purvis, ""to git you off to sleep. He was probably nearly ""off to sleep"" already, but this made no difference. If he was not ""off to sleep"", she had the Ovaltine to ""git him off"". And if he was ""off to sleep"", she woke him up and gave him the Ovaltine to ""git him off"" again.",1
4797,"The real truth of the matter was that she wanted to talk with him, to exchange gossip, and especially to go over the delectable proceedings of the day's news. She would bring him fresh copies of The Times and the Daily Mail, and she would have, of course, her own tabloid paper. Then, while he propped himself up in bed and drank his Ovaltine, Mrs. Purvis would stand in the doorway, rattle her tabloid with a premonitory gesture, and thus begin:  ""Shockin', I calls it!""  ""What's shocking this morning, Mrs. Purvis?""  ""Why, 'ere now, listen to this, if you please!",1
4798,"she would say indignantly, and read as follows: ""'It was announced yesterday, through the offices of the Messrs. Merigrew & Raspe, solicitors to 'Is Grace, the Duke of Basingstoke, that 'Is Grace 'as announced for sale 'is estate at Chipping Cudlington in Gloucestershire. The estate, comprisin' sixteen thousand acres, of which eight thousand are in 'untin' preserve, and includin' Basingstoke Hall, one of the finest examples of early Tudor architecture in the kingdom, 'as been in the possession of 'Is Grace's family since the fifteenth century. Representatives of the Messrs. Merigrew & Raspe stated, 'owever, that because of the enormous increase in the estate and income taxes since the war, 'Is Grace feels that it is no longer possible for 'im to maintain the estate, and 'e is accordingly puttin' it up for sale. This means, of course, that the number of 'Is Grace's private estates 'as now been reduced to three, Fothergill 'All in Devonshire, Wintringham in Yawkshire, and the Castle of Loch McTash, 'is 'untin' preserve in Scotland. 'Is Grace, it is said, 'as stated recently to friends that if somethin' is not done to check the present ruinous trend towards 'igher taxation, there will not be a single great estate in England remainin' in the 'ands of its original owners within a 'undred years...  ""Ah-h,"" said Mrs. Purvis, nodding with an air of knowing confirmation as she finished reading this dolorous item.",1
4799,"There you 'ave it! Just as 'Is Grace says, we're losin' all our great estates. And what's the reason? Why the owners can no longer afford to pay the taxes. Ruinous 'e calls 'em, and 'e's, right. If it keeps up, you mark my words, the nobility'll 'ave no place left to live. A lot of 'em are migratin' already,"" she said darkly.",1
4800,"Migrating where, Mrs. Purvis?""  ""Why,"" she said, ""to France, to Italy, places on the Continent. There is Lord Cricklewood, livin' somewhere in the south of France. And why? Because the taxes got too 'igh for 'im. Let all 'is places go 'ere. Ah-h, lovely places they were, too,"" she said, with appetising tenderness. And the Earl of Pentateuch, Lady Cynthia Wormwood, and 'Er Ladyship, the Dowager Countess of Throttlemarsh--where are they all? They've all left, that's where they are. Packed up and got out. Let their estates go. They've gone abroad to live. And why? Because the taxes are too 'igh. Shockin', I calls it!",1
4801,By this time Mrs. Purvis's pleasant face would be pink with indignation. It was one of the most astonishing demonstrations of concern George had ever seen. Again and again he would try to get to the bottom of it. He would bang down his cup of Ovaltine and burst out:,1
4802,"Yes, but good Lord, Mrs. Purvis, why should you worry so much about it. Those people aren't going to starve. Here you get ten shillings a week from me and eight shillings more from the doctor. He says he's retiring and going abroad to live at the end of this year. I'll be going back to America pretty soon after that. You don't even know where you'll be or what you'll be doing this time next year. Yet you come in here day after day and read me this stuff about the Duke of Basingstoke or the Earl of Pentateuch having to give up one of his half-dozen estates, as if you were afraid the whole lot of them would have to go on the dole. You're the one who will have to go on the dole if you get out of work. Those people are not going to suffer, not really, not the way you'll have to. Ah-h yes,"" she answered quietly, in a tone that was soft and gentle, as if she were speaking of the welfare of a group of helpless children, ""but then, we're used to it, aren't we?",1
4803,"And they, poor things, they're not. It was appalling. He couldn't fathom it. He just felt as if he'd come up smack against an impregnable wall. You could call it what you liked--servile snobbishness, blind ignorance, imbecilic stupidity--but there it was. You couldn't shatter it, you couldn't even shake it. It was the most formidable example of devotion and loyalty he had ever known.",1
4804,"These conversations would go on morning after morning until there was scarcely an impoverished young viscount whose grandeurs and miseries had not undergone the reverent investigation of Mrs. Purvis's anguished and encyclopaedic care. But always at the end--after the whole huge hierarchy of saints, angels, captains of the host, guardians of the inner gate, and chief lieutenants of the right hand had been tenderly inspected down to the minutest multicoloured feather that blazed in their heraldic wings--silence would fall. It was as if some great and unseen presence had entered the room. Then Mrs. Purvis would rattle her crisp paper, clear her throat, and with holy quietness pronounce the sainted name of ""'E"".",1
4805,"Sometimes this moment would come as a sequel to her fascinated discussion of America and the Moddun Tempo, as, after enlarging for the hundredth time upon the shocking and unfortunate lot of the female population in the United States, she would add:  ""I must say, though,"" tactfully, after a brief pause, ""that the American ladies are very smart, aren't they, sir? They're all so well-turned out. You can always tell one when you see one. And then they're very clever, aren't they, sir? I mean, quite a number of 'em 'ave been received at court, 'aven't they, sir? And some of 'em 'ave married into the nobility, too. And of course""--her voice would fall to just the subtlest shade of unction, and George would know what was coming--""of course, sir, 'E...""  Ah, there it was!",1
4806,"Immortal ""'E"", who lived and moved and loved and had his being there at the centre of Daisy Purvis's heaven! Immortal ""'E"", the idol of all the Purvises everywhere, who, for their uses, their devotions, had no other name and needed none but ""'E"". Of course, sir,"" Mrs. Purvis said, ""'E likes 'em, doesn't 'E? I'm told 'E's very fond of 'em. The American ladies must be very clever, sir, because 'E finds 'em so amusin'. There was a picture of 'Im in the news just recently with a party of 'Is friends, and a new American lady was among 'em. At least I'd never seen 'er face before. And very smart she was, too--a Mrs. Somebody-or-other--I can't recall the name. Again, something in the day's news would bring the reverent tone to her voice and the glow of tenderness to her face, as:  ""Well, I see by the paper 'ere that 'E's got back from the Continent.",1
4807,"I wonder what 'E's up to now. And suddenly she laughed, a jolly and involuntary laugh that flushed her pink cheeks almost crimson and brought a mist to her blue eyes. Ah! I tell you what,"" she said, ""'E is a deep one. You never know what 'E's been up to. You pick the paper up one day and read where 'E's visitin' some friends in Yawkshire. The next day, before you know it, 'E turns up in Vienna. This time they say 'E's been in Scandinavia--it wouldn't surprise me if 'E's been over there visitin' one of them young princesses. Of course""--her tone was now tinged with the somewhat pompous loftiness with which she divulged her profounder revelations to the incondite Mr. Webber--""of course there's been talk about that for some time past. Not that 'E would care! Not 'Im! ' E's too independent, 'E is! ' Is mother found that out long ago. She tried to manage 'Im the way she does the others. Not 'Im! That chap's got a will of 'Is own. 'E'll do what 'E wants to do, and no one will stop 'Im--that's 'ow independent 'E is.",1
4808,"She was silent a moment, reflecting with misty eyes upon the object of her idolatry. Then suddenly her pleasant face again suffused with ruddy colour, and a short, rich, almost explosive laugh burst from her as she cried:  ""The dev-ill! You know, they do say 'E was comin' 'ome one night not long ago, and""--her voice lowered confidingly--""they do say 'E'd 'ad a bit too much, and""--her voice sank still lower, and in a tone in which a shade of hesitancy was mixed with laughter, she went on--""well, sir, they do say 'E was 'avin' 'Is troubles in gittin' 'ome. They say that really 'E was 'avin' to support 'Imself, sir, by the fence round St. James's Palace. But they do say, sir, that--ooh! ha-ha-ha!""--she laughed suddenly and throatily. You must excuse me, sir, but I 'ave to larf when I think of it! And then, slowly, emphatically, with an ecstasy of adoration, Mrs. Purvis whispered: ""They say, sir, that the bobby on duty just outside the palace saw 'Im, and came up to 'Im and said: 'Can I 'elp you, sir?' But not 'Im! 'E wouldn't be 'elped! 'E's too proud, 'E is! That's the way 'E's always been. I'll tell you what--'E is a dev-ill! And, still smiling, her strong hands held before her in a worn clasp, she leaned against the door and lapsed into the silence of misty contemplation.",1
4809,"But, Mrs. Purvis,"" George remarked presently, ""do you think he'll ever get married? I mean, do you really, now? After all, he's no chicken any longer, is he? And he must have had lots of chances, and if he was going to do anything about it----""  ""Ah!"" said Mrs. Purvis, in that tone of somewhat lofty recognition that she always used at such a time.",1
4810,"Ah! What I always say to that is, 'E will! ' E'll make up 'Is mind to it when 'E 'as to, but not before! 'E won't be driven into it, not 'Im! But 'E'll do it when 'E knows it is the proper time. Yes, Mrs. Purvis, but what is the proper time?",1
4811,"Well,"" she said, ""after all, there is 'Is father, isn't there? And 'Is father is not as young as 'e used to be, is 'e? She was silent for a moment, diplomatically allowing the tactful inference to sink in by itself. Well, sir,"" she concluded very quietly, ""I mean to say, sir, a time will come, sir, won't it?""  ""Yes, Mrs. Purvis,"" George persisted, ""but will it?",1
4812,"I mean, can you be sure? You know, you hear all sorts of things--even a stranger like myself hears them. For one thing, you hear he doesn't want it very much, and then, of course, there is his brother, isn't there?""  ""Oh, 'im,"" said Mrs. Purvis, ""'im!",1
4813,"For a brief interval she remained silent, but had she filled an entire dictionary with the vocabulary of bitter and unyielding hostility, she could not have said more than she managed to convey in the two letters of that mutilated little pronoun ""'im.""  ""Yes,"" George persisted somewhat cruelly, ""but after all, he wants it, doesn't he?""  ""'E does,"" said Mrs. Purvis grimly. And he is married, isn't he?""  ""'E is,"" said Mrs. Purvis, if anything a trifle more grimly than before. And he has children, hasn't he?""  ""'E 'as, yes,"" said Mrs. Purvis, somewhat more gently.",1
4814,"In fact, for a moment her face glowed with its look of former tenderness, but it grew grim again very quickly as she went on: ""But 'im! Not 'im! She was deeply stirred by this imagined threat to the ascendancy of her idol. Her lips worked tremulously, then she shook her head with a quick movement of inflexible denial and said: ""Not 'im. She was silent for a moment more, as if a struggle were going on between her desire to speak and the cool barrier of her natural reserve. Then she burst out: ""I tell you, sir, I never liked the look of 'im! Not that one--no! She shook her head again in a half-convulsive movement; then, in a tone of dark confidingness, she almost whispered: ""There's somethin' sly about 'is face that I don't like! ' E's a sly one, 'e is, but 'e don't fool me! Her face was now deeply flushed, and she nodded her head with the air of a person who had uttered her grim and final judgment and would not budge from it. That's my opinion, if you ask me, sir! That's the way I've always felt about 'im. And 'er. ' Er! She wouldn't like it, would she? Not 'arf she wouldn't! She laughed suddenly, the bitter and falsetto laugh of an angry woman. Not 'er! Why, it's plain as clay, it's written all over 'er! But a lot of good it'll do 'em,"" she said grimly. We know what's what! She shook her head again with grim decision. The people know. They can't be fooled. So let 'em git along with it!""  ""You don't think, then, that they----""  ""Them!"" said Mrs. Purvis strongly.",1
4815,"Them! Not in a million years, sir! Never! Never!...'E""--her voice fairly soared to a cry of powerful conviction--""'E's the one! ' E's always been the one! And when the time comes, sir, 'E--'E will be King!",1
4816,"In the complete and unquestioning loyalty of her character, Mrs. Purvis was like a large and gentle dog. Indeed, her whole relation to life was curiously animal-like. She had an intense concern for every member of brute creation, and when she saw dogs or horses in the streets she always seemed to notice first the animal and then the human being that it belonged to. She had come to know and recognise all the people in Ebury Street through the dogs they owned. When George questioned her one clay about a distinguished-looking old gentleman with a keen hawk's face whom he had passed several times on the street, Mrs. Purvis answered immediately, with an air of satisfaction:  ""Ah-h, yes.",1
4817,"'E's the one that 'as the rascal in 27. Ah-h, and 'e is a rascal, too,"" she cried, shaking her head and laughing with affectionate remembrance. Big, shaggy fellow 'e is, you know, comin' along, swingin' 'is big shoulders, and looking' as if butter wouldn't melt in 'is mouth. 'E is a rascal. George was a little bewildered by this time and asked her if she meant the gentleman or the dog.",1
4818,"Oh, the dog,"" cried Mrs. Purvis. The dog! A big Scotch shepherd 'e is. Belongs to the gentleman you were speakin' of. Gentleman's some sort of scholar or writer or professor, I believe. Used to be up at Cambridge. Retired now. Lives in 27. Or again, looking out of the window one day into the pea-soup drizzle of the street, George saw an astonishingly beautiful girl pass by upon the other side.",1
4819,"He called Mrs. Purvis quickly, pointed out the girl, and excitedly demanded:  ""Who is she? Do you know her? Does she live here on the street? I can't say, sir,"" Mrs. Purvis answered, looking puzzled.",1
4820,"It seems I must 'ave seen 'er before, but I can't be sure. But I will just keep my eyes open and I'll let you know if I find out where she lives. A few days later Mrs. Purvis came in from her morning's shopping tour, beaming with satisfaction and full of news.",1
4821,"Ah-h,"" she said, ""I 'ave news for you. I found out about the girl. What girl?"" he said, looking up startled from his work.",1
4822,"The girl you asked about the other day,"" said Mrs. Purvis. The one you pointed out to me. Oh yes,"" he said, getting up.",1
4823,"And what about her? Does shelive here in the street? Of course,"" said Mrs. Purvis.",1
4824,"I've seen 'er a 'undred times. I should 'ave known 'er in a second the other day, only she didn't 'ave 'im with 'er. Him?",1
4825,"Who?""  ""Why, the rascal down at 46. That's who she is. That's who who is, Mrs. Purvis?""  ""Why, the great Dane, of course.",1
4826,"You must 'ave seen 'im. 'E's big as a Shetland pony,"" she laughed. 'E's always with 'er. The only time I ever saw 'er without 'im was the other day, and that's why,"" she cried triumphantly, ""I didn't know 'er. But to-day, they were out takin' a walk together and I saw 'em comin'... Then I knew who she was. They're the ones in 46. And the rascal""--here shelaughed affectionately--""ah-h, what a rascal 'e is! Oh, a fine fellow, you know. So big and strong 'e is. I sometimes wonder where they keep 'im, 'ow they found a 'ouse big enough to put 'im in. Hardly a morning passed that she didn't return from her little tour of the neighbourhood flushed with excitement over some new ""rascal"", some ""fine fellow"", some dog or horse she had observed and watched.",1
4827,"She would go crimson with anger over any act of cruelty or indifference to an animal. She would come in boiling with rage because she had passed a horse that had been tightly bridled:  ""... And I gave 'im a piece of my mind, too,"" she would cry, referring to the driver. I told 'im that a man as mistreated a hanimal in that way wasn't fit to 'ave one. If there'd been a constable about, I'd 'ave 'ad 'im took in custody, that's what I'd 'ave done. I told 'im so, too. Shockin', I calls it. The way some people can b'ave to some poor, 'elpless beast that 'as no tongue to tell what it goes through. Let 'em 'ave a bridle in their mouth a bit! Let 'em go round for a while with their faces shut up in a muzzle! Ah-h,"" she would say grimly, as if the idea afforded her a savage pleasure, ""that'd teach 'em! They'd know then, all right!""  There was something disturbing and unwholesome about the extravagance of this feeling for animals.",1
4828,"George observed Mrs. Purvis closely in her relations with people and found out that she was by no means so agitated at the spectacle of human suffering. Her attitude towards the poor, of whom she was one, was remarkable for its philosophic acceptance. Her feeling seemed to be that the poor are always with us, that they are quite used to their poverty, and that this makes it unnecessary for anybody to bother about it, least of all the miserable victims themselves. It had certainly never entered her head that anything should be done about it. The sufferings of the poor seemed to her as natural and as inevitable as the London fog, and to her way of thinking it was just as much a waste of honest emotion to get worked up about the one as about the other.",1
4829,"Thus, on the same morning that she would come in blazing with indignation over the mistreatment of a dog or horse, George would sometimes hear her speak sharply, curtly, and without a trace of feeling to the dirty, half-starved, and half-naked devil of a boy who always delivered the beer from the liquor shop. This wretched child was like some creature out of Dickens--a living specimen of that poverty which, at its worst, has always seemed to be lower and more degraded in England than anywhere else. The thing that gives it its special horror is that in England people of this type appear to be stogged to their misery, sucked down in a swamp of inherited wretchedness which is never going to be any better, and from which they know they can never escape.",1
4830,"So it was with this God-forsaken boy. He was one of the Little People--that race of dwarfs and gnomes which was suddenly and' terribly revealed to George that winter in London. George discovered that there arc really two different orders of humanity in England, and they are so far apart that they hardly seem to belong to the same species. They are the Big People and the Little People.",1
4831,"The Big People are fresh-skinned, ruddy, healthy, and alert; they show by their appearance that they have always had enough to eat. At their physical best, they look like great bulls of humanity. On the streets of London one sees these proud and solid figures of men and women, magnificently dressed and cared for, and one observes that their faces wear the completely vacant and imperturbable expressions of highly bred cattle. These are the British Lords of Creation. And among the people who protect and serve them, and who are really a part of their own order, one also sees some magnificent specimens--strapping Guardsmen, for example, six feet five inches tall and as straight as lances, with the same assured look in their faces, which says plainly that though they may not be the Lords of Creation themselves, at any rate they are the agents and instruments of the Lords.",1
4832,"But if one stays in England long enough, all of a sudden one day he is going to discover the Little People. They are a race of gnomes who look as if they have burrowed in tunnels and lived for so many centuries in underground mines that they have all become pale and small and wizened. Something in their faces and in the gnarled formations of their bodies not only shows the buried lives they live, but also indicates that their fathers and mothers and grandparents for generations before them were similarly starved of food and sunlight and were bred like gnomes in the dark and deep-delved earth.",1
4833,"One hardly notices them at first. But then, one day, the Little People swarm up to the surface of the earth, and for the first time one sees them. That is the way the revelation came to George Webber, and it was an astounding discovery. It was like a kind of terrible magic to realise suddenly that he had been living in this English world and seeing only one part of it, thinking it was the whole. It was not that the Little People were few in number. Once he saw them, they seemed to be almost the whole population. They outnumbered the Big People ten to one. And after he saw them, he knew that England could never look the same to him again, and that nothing he might read or hear about the country thereafter would make sense to him if it did not take the Little People into account.",1
4834,"The wretched boy from the liquor shop was one of them. Everything about him proclaimed eloquently that he had been born dwarfed and stunted into a world of hopeless poverty, and that he had never had enough to eat, or enough clothes to warm him, or enough shelter to keep the cold fogs from seeping through into the very marrow of his bones. It was not that he was actually deformed, but merely that his body seemed to be shrivelled and shrunk and squeezed of its juices like that of an old man. He may have been fifteen or sixteen years old, though there were times when he seemed younger. Always, however, his appearance was that of an under-grown man, and one had the horrible feeling that his starved body had long since given up the unequal struggle and would never grow any more.",1
4835,"He wore a greasy, threadbare little jacket, tightly buttoned, from the sleeves of which his raw wrists and large, grimy, work-reddened hands protruded with almost indecent nakedness. His trousers, tight as a couple of sausage skins, were equally greasy and threadbare, and were inches too short for him. His old and broken shoes were several sizes too big, and from the battered look of them they must have helped to round the edges of every cobble-stone in stony-hearted London. This costume was completed by a shapeless old hulk of a cap, so large and baggy that it slopped over on one side of his head and buried the ear.",1
4836,"What his features were like it was almost impossible to know, because he was so dirty. His flesh, what one could see of it through the unwashed grime, had a lifeless, opaque pallor. The whole face was curiously blurred and blunted, as if it had been moulded hastily and roughly out of tallow. The nose was wide and flat, and turned up at the end to produce great, flaring nostrils. The mouth was thick and dull, and looked as if it had been pressed into the face with a blunt instrument. The eyes were dark and dead.",1
4837,"This grotesque little creature even spoke a different language. It was Cockney, of course, but not sharp, decisive Cockney; it was a kind of thick, catarrhal jargon, so blurred in the muttering that it was almost indecipherable. George could hardly understand him at all. Mrs. Purvis could make better sense of it, but even she confessed that there were times when she did not know what he was talking about. George would hear her beginning to rail at him the instant he came staggering into the house beneath the weight of a heavy case of beer:  ""'Ere, now, mind where you're goin', won't you?",1
4838,"And try not to make so much noise with those bottles! Why can't you wipe those muddy boots before you come in the 'ouse? Don't come clumpin' up the stairs like an 'orse!...Oh,"" she would cry in despair, turning to George, ""'e is the clumsiest chap I ever saw!... And why can't you wash your face once in a while? she would say, striking again at the urchin with her sharp tongue. A great, growin' chap like you ought to be ashamed goin' about where people can see you with a face like that!""  ""Yus,"" he muttered sullenly, ""goin' abaht wiv a fyce lahk that.",1
4839,"If you 'ad to go abaht the wye I do, you'd wash your fyce, wouldn't yer?""  Then, still muttering resentfully to himself, he would clump down the stairs and go away, and from the front window George would watch him as he trudged back up the street towards the wine and liquor shop in which he worked. This store was small, but since the neighbourhood was fashionable the place had that atmosphere of mellow luxury and quiet elegance--something about it a little worn, but all the better for being a little worn--that one finds in small, expensive shops of this sort in England. It was as if the place were mildly tinctured with fog, touched a little with the weather, and with the indefinable but faintly exciting smell of soft coal smoke. And over everything, permeating the very woods of the counter, shelves, and floor, hung the fragrance of old wines and the purest distillations of fine liquors.",1
4840,"You opened the door, and a little bell tinkled gently. You took a half-step down into the shop, and immediately its atmosphere made you feel at peace. You felt opulent and secure. You felt all the powerful but obscure seductions of luxury (which, if you have money, you can feel in England better than anywhere else). You felt rich and able to do anything. You felt that the world was good, and overflowing with delectable delicacies, and that all of them were yours for the asking.",1
4841,"The proprietor of this luxurious little nest of commerce seemed just exactly the man for such an office. He was middle-aged, of medium height, spare of build, with pale brown eyes and brown moustaches--wispy, rather long, and somewhat lank. He wore a wing collar, a black necktie, and a scarf-pin. He usually appeared in shirt-sleeves, but he dispelled any suggestion of improper informality by wearing arm protectors of black silk. This gave him just the proper touch of unctuous yet restrained servility. He was middle class--not middle class as America knows it, not even middle class as the English usually know it--but a very special kind of middle class, serving middle class, as befitted a purveyor of fine comforts to fine gentlemen. He was there to serve the gentry, to live upon the gentry, to exist by, through, and for the gentry, and always to bend a little at the waist when gentry came.",1
4842,"As you entered the shop, he would come forward behind his counter, say ""Good evening, sir,"" with just the proper note of modified servility, make some remark about the weather, and then, arching his thin, bony, sandily-freckled hands upon the counter, he would bend forwards slightly--wing collar, black necktie, black silk arm protectors, moustache, pale brown eyes, pale, false smile, and all the rest of him--and with servile attentiveness, not quite fawning, would wait to do your bidding. What is good to-day? Have you a claret, a sound yet modestly-priced vintage you can recommend?""  ""A claret, sir?"" in silken tones.",1
4843,"We have a good one, sir, and not expensive either. A number of our patrons have tried it. They all pronounce it excellent. You'll not go wrong, sir, if you try this one. And how about a Scotch whisky?""  ""A Haig, sir?",1
4844,"Again the silken tones. You'll not go wrong on Haig, sir. But perhaps you'd like to try another brand, something a trifle rare, a little more expensive, perhaps a little more mature. Some of our patrons have tried this one, sir. It costs a shilling more, but if you like the smoky flavour you'll find it worth the difference. Oh, the fond, brisk slave!",1
4845,"The fond, neat slave! The fond slave bending at the waist, with bony fingers arched upon his counter! The fond slave with his sparse hair neatly parted in the middle, and the narrow forehead arched with even corrugations of pale wrinkles as the face lifted upwards with its thin, false smile! Oh, this fond, brisk pander to fine gentlemen--and that wretched boy! For suddenly, in the midst of all this show of eager servitude, this painted counterfeit of warmth, the man would turn like a snarling cur upon that miserable child, who stood there sniffling through his catarrhal nose, shuffling his numbed feet for circulation, and chafing his reddened, chapped, work-coarsened hands before the cheerful, crackling fire of coals:  ""Here, now, what are you hanging round the shop for?",1
4846,"Have you delivered that order to Number 12 yet? Be on your way, then, and don't keep the gentleman waiting any longer! And then immediately the grotesque return to silken courtesy, to the pale, false smile again, to the fawning unctions of his ""Yes, sir. A dozen bottles, sir. Within thirty minutes, sir. To Number 42--oh, quite so, sir. Good night.",1
4847,"And good night, good night, good night to you, my fond, brisk slave, you backbone of a nation's power. Good night to you, staunch symbol of a Briton's rugged independence. Good night to you, and to your wife, your children, and your mongrel tyranny over their lives. Good night to you, my little autocrat of the dinner-table. Good night to you, my lord and master of the Sunday leg of mutton. Good night to you, my gentlemen's pander in Ebury Street.",1
4848,"And good night to you, as well, my wretched little boy, my little dwarf, my gnome, my grimy citizen from the world of the Little People. The fog drifts thick and fast to-night into the street. It sifts and settles like a cloak, until one sees the street no longer. And where the shop light shines upon the fog, there burns a misty glow, a blurred and golden bloom of radiance, of comfort, and of warmth. Feet pass the shop, men come ghostwise from the fog's thick mantle, are for a moment born, are men again, are heard upon the pavement, then, wraithlike, vanish into fog, are ghosts again, are lost, are gone. The proud, the mighty, and the titled of the earth, the lovely and protected, too, go home--home to their strong and sheltered walls behind the golden nimbus of other lights, fog-flowered. Four hundred yards away the tall sentries stamp and turn and march again. All's glory here. All's strong as mortared walls. All's loveliness and joy within this best of worlds.",1
4849,"And you, you wretched child, so rudely and unfitly wrenched into this world of glory, wherever you must go to-night, in whatever doorway you must sleep, upon whatever pallet of foul-smelling straw, within whatever tumbled warren of old brick, there in the smoke, the fog-cold welter, and the swarming web of old, unending London--sleep well as can be, and hug the ghosts of warmth about you as you remember the forbidden world and its imagined glory. So, my little gnome, good night. May God have mercy on us all.  33.",1
4850,"Enter Mr. Lloyd McHarg During the late autumn and early winter of that year occurred an event which added to Webber's chronicle the adventure of an extraordinary experience. He had received no news from America for several weeks when, suddenly in November, he began to get excited letters from his friends, informing him of a recent incident that bore directly on his own career. The American novelist, Mr. Lloyd McHarg, had just published a new book which had been instantly and universally acclaimed as a monument of national significance, as well as the crowning achievement in McHarg's brilliant literary career. George had read in the English press brief accounts of the book's tremendous success, but now he began to receive enlargements on the news from his friends at home. Mr. McHarg, it seemed, had given an interview to reporters, and to the astonishment of everyone had begun to talk, not about his own book, but about Webber's. Cuttings of the interview were sent to George. He read them with astonishment, and with the deepest and most earnest gratitude.",1
4851,"George had never met Mr. Lloyd McHarg. He had never had occasion to communicate with him in any way. He knew him only through his books. He was, of course, one of the chief figures in American letters, and now, at the zenith of his career, when he had won the greatest ovation one could win, he had seized the occasion, which most men would have employed for purposes of self-congratulation, to praise enthusiastically the work of an obscure young writer who was a total stranger to him and who had written only one book.",1
4852,"It seemed to George then, as it seemed to him ever afterwards, one of the most generous acts he had ever known, and when he had somewhat recovered from the astonishment and joy which this unexpected news had produced in him, he sat down and wrote to Mr. McHarg and told him how he felt. In a short time he had an answer from him--a brief note, written from New York. Mr. McHarg said that he had spoken as he had because he felt that way about Webber's book, and that he was happy to have had the opportunity of giving public acknowledgment to his feeling. He said that he was about to be awarded an honorary degree by one of America's leading universities--an event which, he confessed with pardonable pride, pleased him all the more because the award was to be made out of season, in special recognition of his last book, and because the ceremony attending it was not to be part of the usual performance of trained seals at commencement time. He said that he was sailing for Europe immediately afterwards and would spend some time on the Continent, that he would be in England a little later, and that he hoped to see Webber then. George wrote back and told him he was looking forward to their meeting, gave him his address, and there for a time the matter rested.",1
4853,"Mrs. Purvis was a party to George's elation, which was so exultant that he could not have kept the reason a secret from her if he had tried. She was almost as excited about his impending meeting with Mr. McHarg as he was. Together they would scan the papers for news of Mr. McHarg. One morning she brought the ""nice 'ot cup"" of Ovaltine, rattled the pages of her tabloid paper, and said:  ""I see where 'e is on 'is way.",1
4854,"'E's sailed already from New York. A few days later George smacked the crisp sheets of The Times and cried: ""He's there! He's landed! He's in Europe! It won't be long now!",1
4855,"Then came the never-to-be-forgotten morning when she brought the usual papers, and with them the day's mail, and in the mail a letter from Fox Edwards, enclosing a long clipping from The New York Times. This was a full account of the ceremonies at which Mr. McHarg had been awarded his honorary degree. Before a distinguished gathering at the great university Mr. McHarg had made a speech, and the clipping contained an extended quotation of what he had had to say. George had not foreseen it. He had not imagined it could happen. His name shot up at him from the serried columns of close print and exploded in his eyes like shrapnel. A hard knot gathered in his throat and choked him. His heart leaped, skipped, hammered at his ribs. McHarg had put Webber in his speech, had spoken of him there at half a column's length. He had hailed the younger man as a future spokesman of his country's spirit, an evidence of a fruition that had come, of a continent that had been discovered. He called Webber a man of genius, and held his name before the mighty of the earth as a pledge of what America was, and a token of where it would go.",1
4856,"And suddenly George remembered who he was, and saw the journey he had come. He remembered Locust Street in Old Catawba twenty years before and Nebraska, Randy, and the Potterhams, Aunt Maw and Uncle Mark, his father and the little boy that he had been, with the hills closing in round him, and at night the whistles wailing northward towards the world. And now his name, whose name was nameless, had become a shining thing, and a boy who once had waited tongueless in the South had, through his language, opened golden gateways to the Earth.",1
4857,"Mrs. Purvis felt it almost as much as he did. He pointed speechless to the clipping. He tapped the shining passages with trembling hand. He thrust the clipping at her. She read it, flushed crimson in the face, turned suddenly, and went away.",1
4858,"After that they waited daily for McHarg's coming. Week lengthened into week. They searched the papers every morning for news of him. He seemed to be making a tour of Europe, and everywhere he went he was entertained and feted and interviewed and photographed in the company of other famous men. Now he was in Copenhagen. Now he was staying in Berlin a week or two. Later he had gone to Baden-Baden for a cure.",1
4859,"Oh Lord! George groaned dismally. How long does that take?""  Again he was in Amsterdam; and then silence.",1
4860,"Christmas came. I should 'ave thought,"" said Mrs. Purvis, ""'e'd be 'ere by now. New Year's came, and still there was no word from Lloyd McHarg.",1
4861,"One morning about the middle of January, after George had worked all night, and now, in bed, was carrying on his usual chat with Mrs. Purvis, he had just spoken of McHarg's long-deferred arrival rather hopelessly--when the phone rang. Mrs. Purvis went into the sitting-room and answered it. George could hear her saying formally:  ""Yes.",1
4862,"Who shall I say? Who's callin', please? A waiting silence. Then, rather quickly: ""Just a moment, sir. She entered George's room, her face flushed, and said: ""Mr. Lloyd Mc'Arg is on the wire. To say that George got out of bed would be to give a hopelessly inadequate description of a movement which hurled him into the air, bedclothes and all, as if he had been shot out of a cannon.",1
4863,"He landed squarely in his bedroom slippers, and in two strides, still shedding bedclothes as he went, he was through the door, into the sitting-room, and had the receiver in his hand. Hello, hello, hello!"" he stammered. Who--what--is that?""  McHarg was even quicker.",1
4864,"His voice, rapid, feverish, somewhat nasal and high-pitched, unmistakably American, stabbed nervously across the wire and said:  ""Hello, hello. Is that you, George? He called him by his first name immediately. How are you, son? How are you, boy? How are they 'treating you?""  ""Fine, Mr. McHarg!",1
4865,"George yelled. It is Mr. McHarg, isn't it? Say, Mr. McHarg-----""  ""Now take it easy!",1
4866,"Take it easy! he cried feverishly. Don't shout so loud! he yelled. I'm not in New York, you know! I know you're not,"" George screamed.",1
4867,"That's what I was just about to say!""--laughing idiotically. Say, Mr. McHarg, when can we----""  ""Now wait a minute, wait a minute! Let me do the talking. Don't get so excited. Now listen, George! His voice had the staccato rapidity of a telegraph ticker. Even though one bad never seen him, one would have got instantly an accurate impression of his feverishly nervous vitality, wire-taut tension, and incessant activity. Now listen! he barked. I want to see you and talk to you. We'll have lunch together and talk things over. Fine!",1
4868,"F-fine! George stuttered. I'll be delighted! Any time you say. I know you're busy. I can meet you to-morrow, next day, Friday--next week if that suits you better. Next week, hell 1"" he rasped.",1
4869,"How much time do you think I've got to wait around for lunch? You're coming here for lunch to-day. Come on! Get busy! Get a move on you! he cried irritably. How long will it take you to get here, anyway?""  George asked him where he was staying, and he gave an address on one of the streets near St. James's and Piccadilly.",1
4870,"It was only a ten-minute ride in a taxi, but since it was not yet ten o'clock in the morning George suggested that he arrive there around noon. What? Two hours? For Christ's sake! McHarg cried in a high-pitched, irritated voice. Where the hell do you live anyway? In the north of Scotland?""  George told him no, that he was only ten minutes away, but that he thought he might want to wait two or three hours before he had his lunch.",1
4871,"Wait two or three hours?"" he shouted. Say, what the hell is this, anyway? How long do you expect me to wait for lunch? You don't keep people waiting two or three hours every time you have lunch with them, do you, George?"" he said, in a milder but distinctly aggrieved tone of voice. Christ, man! A guy'd starve to death if he had to wait on you!",1
4872,"George was getting more and more bewildered, and wondered if it was the custom of famous writers to have lunch at ten o'clock in the morning, but he stammered hastily:  ""No, no, certainly not, Mr. McHarg. I can come any time you say. It will only take me t y minutes or half an hour. I thought you said you were only ten minutes away?""  ""I know, but I've got to dress and shave first.",1
4873,"Dress! Shaver"" McHarg yelled. For Christ's sake, you mean to tell me you're not out of bed yet? What do you do? Sleep till noon every day? How in the name of God do you ever get any work done?""  By this time George felt so crushed that he did not dare tell McHarg that he was not only not out of bed, but that he'd hardly been to bed yet; somehow it seemed impossible to confess that he had worked all night.",1
4874,"He did not know what new explosion of derision or annoyance this might produce, so he compromised and mumbled some lame excuse about having worked late the night before. Well, come on, then! he cried impatiently, before the words were out of George's mouth. Snap out of it! Hop into a taxi and come on up here as soon as you can. Don't stop to shave,"" he said curtly. I've been with a Dutchman for the last three days and I'm hungry as hell! With these cryptic words he banged the receiver up in George's eat, leaving him to wonder, in a state of stunned bewilderment, just why being with a Dutchman for three days should make anyone hungry as hell.",1
4875,"Mrs. Purvis already had a clean shirt and his best suit of clothes laid out for him by the time he returned to his room. While he put them on she got out the brush and the shoe polish, took his best pair of shoes just beyond the open door into the sitting-room, and went right down on her knees and got to work on them. And while she laboured on them she called in to him, a trifle wistfully:  ""I do 'ope 'e gives you a good lunch.",1
4876,"We was 'avin' gammon and peas again to-day. Ah-h, a prime bit, too. I 'ad just put 'em on when 'e called. Well, I hate to miss them, Mrs. Purvis,"" George called back, as he struggled into his trousers.",1
4877,"But you go on and eat them, and don't worry about me. I'll get a good lunch. 'E'll take you to the Ritz, no doubt,"" she called again a trifle loftily.",1
4878,"Oh,"" George answered easily as he pulled on his shirt, ""I don't think he likes those places. People of that sort,"" he shouted with great assurance, as if he were on intimate terms with ""people of that sort""--""they don't go in for swank as a rule. He's probably bored stiff with it, particularly after all he's been through these past few weeks. He'd probably much rather go to some simple place. Um. Shouldn't wonder,"" said Mrs. Purvis reflectively.",1
4879,"Meetin' all them artists and members of the nobility. Probably fed up with it, I should think,"" she said. I know I should be,"" which meant that she would have given only her right eye for the opportunity. You might take 'im to Simpson's, you know,"" she said in the offhand manner that usually accompanied her most important contributions.",1
4880,"There's an idea,"" George cried. Or to Stone's Chop House in Panton Street. Ah yes,"" she said.",1
4881,"That's just off the 'Ay Market, isn't it?""  ""Yes, runs between the Hay Market and Leicester Square,"" George said, tying his tie. An old place, you know, two hundred years or more, not quite so fancy as Simpson's, but he might like it better on that account. They don't let women in,"" he added with a certain air of satisfaction, as if this in itself would probably recommend the place to his distinguished host.",1
4882,"Yes, and their ale, they say, is grand,"" said Mrs. Purvis. It's the colour of mahogany,"" George said, throwing on his coat, ""and it goes down like velvet. I've tried it, Mrs. Purvis. They bring it to you in a silver tankard. And after two of them you'd send flowers to your own mother-in-law. She laughed suddenly and heartily and came bustling in with the shoes, her pleasant face suffused with pink colour.",1
4883,"Excuse me, sir,"" she said, setting the shoes down. But you do 'ave a way of puffin' things. I 'ave to larf sometimes...1 Still, in Simpson's--you won't go wrong in Simpson's, you know,"" said Mrs. Purvis, who had never seen any of these places in her whole life. If 'e likes mutton--ah-h, I tell you what,"" she said with satisfaction, ""you do get a prime bit of mutton there. He put on his shoes and noted that only ten minutes had passed since Mr. McHarg hung up.",1
4884,"He was now dressed and ready, so he started out the door and down the stairs, flinging on lovercoat as he descended. Despite the early hour, his appetite ad been whetted by his conversation, and he felt that he would be able to do full justice to his lunch. He had reached the street and was hailing a taxi when Mrs. Purvis came running after him, waving a clean handkerchief, which she put neatly in the breast-pocket of his coat. He thanked her and signalled again to the taxi.",1
4885,"It was one of those old, black, hearselike contraptions with a baggage rack on top which, to an American, used to the gaudy, purring thunderbolts of the New York streets, seem like Victorian relics, and which are often, indeed, driven by elderly Jehus with walrus moustaches who were driving hansom cabs at the time of Queen Victoria's jubilee. This ancient vehicle now rolled sedately towards him, on the wrong side of the street as usual--which is to say, on the right side for the English. George opened the door, gave the walrus the address, and told him to make haste, that the occasion was pressing. He said: ""Very good, sir,"" with courteous formality, wheeled the old crate round, and rolled sedately up the street again at exactly the same pace, which was about twelve miles an hour. They passed the grounds of Buckingham Palace, wheeled into the Mall, turned up past St. James's Palace into Pall Mall, thence into St. James's Street, and in a moment more drew up before McHarg's address.",1
4886,"It was a bachelors' chambers, one of those quiet and sedate-looking places that one finds in England, and that are so wonderfully comfortable if one has the money. Inside, the appointments suggested a small and very exclusive club. George spoke to a man in the tiny office. He answered:  ""Mr. McHarg?",1
4887,"Of course, sir. He is expecting you... John,"" to a young man in uniform and brass buttons, ""take the gentleman up. They entered the lift.",1
4888,"John closed the door carefully, gave a vigorous tug to the rope, and sedately they crept up, coming to a more or less accurate halt, after a few more manipulations of the rope, at one of the upper floors. John opened the door, stepped out with an ""If you please, sir,"" and led off down the hall to a door which stood partially open and from which there came a confused hum of voices. John rapped gently, entered in response to the summons, and said quietly:  ""Mr. Webber calling, sir.""  There were three men in the room, but so astonishing was the sight of McHarg that at first George did not notice the other two.",1
4889,"McHarg was standing in the middle of the floor with a glass in one hand and a bottle of Scotch whisky in the other, preparing to pour himself a drink. When he saw George he looked up quickly, put the bottle down, and advanced with his hand extended in greeting. There was something almost terrifying in his appearance. George recognised him instantly. He had seen McHarg's pictures many times, but he now realised how beautifully unrevealing are the uses of photography. He was fantastically ugly, and to this ugliness was added a devastation of which George had never seen the equal.",1
4890,"The first and most violent impression was his astonishing redness. Everything about him was red--hair, large protuberant ears, eyebrows, eyelids, even his bony, freckled, knuckly hands. (As George noticed the hands he understood why everyone who knew him called him ""Knuckles"".) Moreover, it was a most alarming redness. His face was so red that it seemed to throw off heat, and if at that moment smoke had begun to issue from his nostrils and he had burst out in flames all over, George would hardly have been surprised.",1
4891,"His face did not have that fleshy and high-coloured floridity that is often seen in men who have drunk too long and too earnestly. It was not like that at all. McHarg was thin to the point of emaciation. He was very tall, six feet two or three, and his excessive thinness and angularity made him seem even taller. George thought he looked ill and wasted. His face, which was naturally a wry, puckish sort of face--as one got to know it better, a pugnacious but very attractive kind of face, full of truculence, but also with an impish humour and a homely, Yankee, freckled kind of modesty that were wonderfully engaging--this face now looked as puckered up as if it were permanently about to swallow a half-green persimmon, and it also seemed to be all dried out and blistered by the fiery flames that burned in it. And out of this face peered two of the most remarkable-looking eyes in all the world. Their colour must originally have been light blue, but now they were so bleached and faded that they looked as if they had been poached.",1
4892,"He came towards George quickly, with his bony, knuckled hand extended in greeting, his lips twitching and bared nervously over his large teeth, his face turned wryly upwards and to one side in an expression that was at once truculent, nervously apprehensive, and yet movingly eloquent of something fiercely and permanently wounded, something dreadfully lacerated, something so tender and unarmed in the soul and spirit of the man that life had got in on him at a thousand points and slashed him to ribbons. He took George's hand and shook it vigorously, at the same time bristling up to him with his wry and puckered face like a small boy to another before the fight begins, as if to say: ""Go on, now, go on. Knock that chip off my shoulder. I dare and double-dare you. This was precisely his manner now, except that he said:  ""Why you--why you monkeyfied--why you monkeyfied bastard, you!",1
4893,"Just look at him! he cried suddenly in a high-pitched voice, half-turning to his companions. Why you--who the hell ever told you you could write, anyway? Then cordially: ""George, how are you? Come on in, come on over here!",1
4894,"And, still holding Webber's hand in his bony grip, and taking his arm with his other hand, he led him across the room towards his other guests. Then, suddenly releasing him, and striking a pompous oratorical attitude, he began to declaim in the florid accents of an after-dinner speaker:  ""Ladies and gentlemen, it is my peculiar privilege, and I may even say my distinguished honour, to present to the members of the Hog Head Hollow Ladies Leeterary, Arteestic, and Mutual Culshural Society our esteemed guest of honour--a man who writes books that are so God-damned long that few people can even pick 'em up. A man whose leeterary style is distinguished by such a command of beautiful English as she is wrote that he has rarely been known to use less than twenty-one adjectives where four would do. He changed abruptly, dropped his oratorical attitude, and laughed a sudden, nervous, dry, falsetto laugh, at the same time mauling Webber in the ribs with a bony finger.",1
4895,"How do you like that, George?"" he said with immediate friendly warmth. Does that get 'em? Is that the way they do it? Not bad, eh? He was obviously pleased with his effort.",1
4896,"George,"" he now continued in a natural tone of voice, ""I want you to meet two friends of mine. Mr. Bendien, of Amsterdam,"" he said, presenting Webber to a heavy-set, red-faced, elderly Dutchman, who sat by the table within easy reaching distance of a tall brown crock of Holland gin, of which, to judge from his complexion, he had already consumed a considerable quantity. Ladies and gentlemen,"" cried McHarg, striking another attitude, ""allow me to introduce that stupendous, that death-defying, that thrill-packed wonder of the ages, that hair-raising and spine-tingling act which has thrilled most of the crowned heads of Europe and all of the deadheads of Amsterdam. Now appearing absolutely for the first time under the big tent. Ladies and gentlemen, I now take pleasure in introducing Mynheer Cornelius Bendien, the Dutch maestro, who will perform for you his celebrated act of balancing an eel on the end of his nose while he swallows in rapid succession, without pausing for breath, three--count 'em--three brown jugs of the finest imported Holland gin. Mr. Bendien, Mr. Webber... How was that, boy, how was that?"" said McHarg, laughing his shrill falsetto, and turning and prodding Webber again with an eager finger.",1
4897,"Then, somewhat more curtly, he said: ""You may have met Mr. Donald Stoat before. He tells me that he knows you. The other man looked out from underneath his heavy eyebrows and inclined his head pompously.",1
4898,"I believe,"" he said, ""I have had the honour of Mr. Webber's acquaintance. George remembered him, although he had seen him only once or twice, and that some years before. Mr. Stoat was not the kind of man one easily forgets.",1
4899,"It was plain to see that McHarg was on edge, terribly nervous, and also irritated by Stoat's presence. He turned away abruptly, muttering: ""Too--too--too--much--too much. And then, wheeling about suddenly: ""All right, George. Have a drink. What's it going to be?""  ""My own experience,"" said Mr. Stoat with unctuous pomposity, ""is that the best drink in the morning""--he leered significantly with his bushy eyebrows--""a gentleman's drink, if I may say so--is a glawss of dry sherry.",1
4900,"He had a ""glawss"" of this beverage in his hand at the moment, and, lifting it with an air of delicate connoisseurship, at the same time working his eyebrows appraisingly, he sniffed it--an action which seemed to irritate McHarg no end. Allow me,"" continued Mr. Stoat, with rotund deliberation, ""to recommend it to your consideration. McHarg began to pace rapidly up and down.",1
4901,"Too much--too much,"" he muttered. All right, George,"" he said irritably, ""what'll you have to drink--Scotch?""  Mynheer Bendien put in his oar at this point. Holding up his glass and leaning forward with a hand on one fat knee, he said with guttural solemnity: ""You should trink chin. Vy don't you try a trink of Holland chin? This advice also seemed to annoy Mr. McHarg.",1
4902,"He glared at Bendien with his flaming face, then, throwing up his bony hands with a quick, spasmodic movement, he cried: ""Oh, for God's sake! He turned and began to pace up and down again, muttering: ""Too much--too much--too--too--too much. Then abruptly, in a voice shrill with irritation: ""Let him drink what he wants, for Christ's sake! Go ahead, Georgie,"" he said roughly. Drink what you like. Pour yourself some Scotch. And suddenly turning to Webber, his whole face lighting up with an impish smile, his lips flickering nervously above his teeth: ""Isn't it wonderful, Georgie? Isn't it marvellous? K-k-k-k-k""--prodding Webber in the ribs with bony forefinger, and laughing a high, dry, feverish laugh--""Can you beat it?""  ""I confess,"" said Mr. Donald Stoat at this point, with rotund unction, ""that I have not read our young friend's opus, which, I believe""--unction here deepening visibly into rotund sarcasm--""which, I believe, has been hailed by certain of our cognoscenti as a masterpiece.",1
4903,"After all, there are so many masterpieces nowadays, aren't there? Scarcely a week goes by but what I pick up my copy of The Times--I refer, of course, to The Times of London, as distinguished from its younger and somewhat more immature colleague, The New York Times--to find that another of our young men has enriched English literature with another masterpiece of im--perish--able prose. All this was uttered in ponderous periods with leerings and twitchings of those misplaced moustaches that served the gentleman for eyebrows.",1
4904,"McHarg was obviously becoming more and more annoyed, and kept pacing up and down, muttering to himself. Mr. Stoat, however, was too obtuse by nature, and too entranced by the rolling cadences of his own rhetoric, to observe the warning signals. After leering significantly with his eyebrows again, he went on:  ""I can only hope, however, that our young friend here is a not too enthusiastic devotee of the masters of what I shall call The School of Bad Taste.",1
4905,"What are you talking about?"" said McHarg, pausing suddenly, half-turning, and glaring fiercely. I suppose you mean Hugh Walpole, and John Galsworthy, and other dangerous radicals of that sort, eh?""  ""No, sir,"" said Mr. Stoat deliberately. I was not thinking of them. I was referring to that concocter of incoherent nonsense, that purveyor of filth, the master of obscenity, who wrote that book so few people can read, and no one can understand, but which some of our young men are hailing enthusiastically as the greatest masterpiece of the century. What book are you talking about anyway?",1
4906,"McHarg said irritably. Its name, I believe,"" said Mr. Stoat pompously, ""is Ulysses. Its author, I have heard, is an Irishman. Oh,"" cried McHarg with an air of enlightenment, and with an impish gleam in his eye that was quite lost on Mr. Stoat.",1
4907,"You're speaking of George Moore, aren't you?""  ""That's it! That's it! cried Mr. Stoat quickly, nodding his head with satisfaction. He was getting excited now. His eyebrows twitched more rapidly than ever. That's the fellow! And the book""--he sputtered--""pah! He spat out the word as though it had been brought up by an emetic, and screwed the eyebrows round across his domy forehead in an expression of nausea. I tried to read a few pages of it once,"" he whispered sonorously and dramatically, ""but I let it fall. I let it fall. As though I bad touched a tainted thing, I let it fall. And then,"" he said hoarsely, ""I washed my hands, with a very--strong--soap. My dear sir,"" cried McHarg suddenly, with an air of sincere conviction, at the same time being unable to keep his eye from gleaming more impishly than ever, ""you are absolutely right.",1
4908,"I absolutely agree with you. Mr. Stoat, who had been very much on his dignity up to now, thawed visibly under the seducing cajolery of this unexpected confrrmation of his literary judgment. You are positively and unanswerably correct,"" said Knuckles, now standing in the middle of the room with his long legs spread wide apart, his bony hands hanging to the lapels of his coat. You have hit the nail right smack--dead--square on the top of its head. As he uttered these words, he jerked his wry face from side to side to give them added emphasis. There has never been a dirtier--filthier--more putrid--and more corrupt writer than George Moore. And as for that book of his, Ulysses,"" McHarg shouted, ""that is unquestionably the vilest----""  ""--the rottenest----"" shouted Mr. Stoat----  ""--the most obscene----"" shrilled McHarg----  ""--the most vicious----"" panted Mr. Stoat----  ""--unadulterated----""  ""--piece of tripe----"" choked Mr. Stoat with rapturous agreement----  ""--tha t has ever polluted the pages, defiled the name, and besmirched the record----""  ""--of English literature!"" gasped Mr. Stoat happily, and paused, panting for breath.",1
4909,"Yes,"" he went on when he had recovered his power of speech, ""and that other thing--that play of his--that rotten, vile, vicious, so-called tragedy in five acts--what was the name of that thing, anyway?""  ""Oh,"" cried McHarg with an air of sudden recognition ""you mean The Importance of Being Earnest, don't you?""  ""No, no,"" said Mr. Stoat impatiently. Not that one. This one came later on. Oh yes!",1
4910,"McHarg exclaimed, as if it had suddenly come to him. You're speaking of Mrs. Warren's Profession, aren't you?""  ""That's it, that's it! cried Mr. Stoat. I took my wife to see it--I took my wife--my own wife----""  ""His own wife!",1
4911,"McHarg repeated, as if astounded, ""Well I'll be God-damned,"" he said. What do you know about that! And would you believe it, sir?",1
4912,"Mr. Stoat's voice again sank to a whisper of loathing and revulsion, and his eyebrows worked ominously about his face. I was so ashamed--I was so ashamed--that I could not look at her. We got up and left, sir, before the end of the first act--before anyone could see us. I went away with head bowed, as one who had been forced to take part in some nasty thing. Well what do you know about that?"" said McHarg sympathetically.",1
4913,"Wasn't that just too damned bad? I call it perfectly damned awful! he shouted suddenly, and turned away, his jaw muscles working convulsively as he muttered again: ""Too much--too much. He halted abruptly in front of Webber with his puckered face aflame and his lips twitching nervously, and began to prod him in the ribs, laughing his high, falsetto laugh. He's a publisher,"" he squeaked. He publishes books. K-k-k-k-k--Can you beat it, Georgie? he squeaked almost inaudibly. Then, jerking a bony thumb in the direction of the astonished Stoat, he shrieked: ""In the name of Christ Almighty--a publisher!""--and resumed his infuriated pacing of the room.",1
4914,"34. The Two Visitors Ever since George entered the room he had been wondering about the presence of McHarg's two strangely assorted visitors. Anyone could see at a glance that Bendien and Stoat were not clever men, not men of the spirit, and that neither possessed any qualities of intellect or of perception that could interest a person like Lloyd McHarg. What, then, were they doing here in this simulation of boon companionship so early in the morning?",1
4915,"Mynheer Bendien was obviously just a business man, a kind of Dutch Babbitt. He was, indeed, a hard-bargaining, shrewd importer who plied a constant traffrc between England and Holland, and was intimately familiar with the markets and business practices of both countries. His occupation had left its mark upon him, that same mark which is revealed in a coarsening of perception and a blunting of sensitivity among people of his kind the world over.",1
4916,"As George observed the signs that betrayed what Bendien was beyond any mistaking, he felt confirmed in an opinion that had been growing on him of late. He had begun to see that the true races of mankind are not at all what we are told in youth that they are. They are not defined either by national frontiers or by the characteristics assigned to them by the subtle investigations of anthropologists. More and more George was coming to believe that the real divisions of humanity cut across these barriers and arise out of differences in the very souls of men.",1
4917,"George had first had his attention called to this phenomenon by an observation of H. L. Mencken. In his extraordinary work on the American language, Mencken gave an example of the American sporting writers' jargon--""Babe Smacks Forty-second with Bases Loaded""--and pointed out that such a headline would be as completely meaningless to an Oxford don as the dialect of some newly discovered tribe of Eskimos. True enough; but what shocked George to attention when he read it was that Mencken drew the wrong inference from his fact. The headline would be meaningless to the Oxford don, not because it was written in the American language, but because the Oxford don had no knowledge of baseball. The same headline might be just as meaningless to a Harvard professor, and for the same reason.",1
4918,"It seemed to George that the Oxford don and the Harvard professor had far more kinship with each other--a far greater understanding of each other's ways of thinking, feeling, and living--than either would have with millions of people of his own nationality. This observation led George to realise that academic life has created its own race of men who are set apart from the rest of humanity by the affinity of their souls. This academic race, it seemed to him, had innumerable peculiar characteristics of its own, among them the fact that, like the sporting gentry, they had invented their own private languages for communication with one another. The internationalism of science was another characteristic: there is no such thing as English chemistry or American physics or (Stalin to the contrary notwithstanding) Russian biology, but only chemistry, physics and biology. So, too, it follows that one tells a good deal more about a man when one says he is a chemist than when one says he is an Englishman.",1
4919,"In the same way, Babe Ruth would probably feel more closely akin to the English professional cricketer, Jack Hobbs, than to a professor of Greek at Princeton. This would be true also among prize-fighters. George thought of that whole world that is so complete within itself--the fighters, the trainers, the managers, the promoters, the touts, the pimps, the gamblers, the grafters, the hangers-on, the newspaper ""experts"" in New York, London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, and Buenos Aires. These men were not really Americans, Englishmen, Frenchmen, Germans, Italians, and Argentines. They were simply citizens of the world of prize-fighting, more at home with one another than with other men of their respective nations.",1
4920,"Throughout all the years of his life, George Webber had been soaking up experience like a sponge. This process never ceased with him, but within the last few years he had noticed a change in it. Formerly, in his insatiable hunger to know everything--to see all the faces in a crowd at once, to remember every face that passed him on a city street, to hear all the voices in a room and through the vast, perplexing blur to distinguish what each was saying--he had often felt that he was drowning in some vast sea of his own sensations and impressions. But now he was no longer so overwhelmed by Amount and Number. He was growing up, and out of the very accumulation of experience he was gaining an essential perspective and detachment. Each new sensation and impression was no longer a single, unrelated thing: it took its place in a pattern and sifted down to form certain observable cycles of experience. Thus his incessantly active mind was free to a much greater degree than ever before to remember, digest, meditate, and compare, and to seek relations between all the phenomena of living. The result was an astonishing series of discoveries as his mind noted associations and resemblances, and made recognitions not only of surface similarities but of identities of concept and of essence.",1
4921,"In this way he had become aware of the world of waiters, who, more than any other class of men, seemed to him to have created a special universe of their own which had almost obliterated nationality and race in the ordinary sense of those words. For some reason George had always been especially interested in waiters. Possibly it was because his own beginnings had been small-town middle class, and because he had been accustomed from birth to the friendship of working people, and because the experience of being served at table by a man in uniform had been one of such sensational novelty that its freshness had never worn off. Whatever the reason, he had known hundreds of waiters in many different countries, had talked to them for hours at a time, had observed them intimately, and had gathered tremendous stores of knowledge about their lives--and out of all this had discovered that there are not really different nationalities of waiters but rather a separate race of waiters, whole and complete within itself. This seemed to be true even among the French, the most sharply defined, the most provincial, and the most unadaptive nationality George had ever known. It surprised him to observe that even in France the waiters seemed to belong to the race of waiters rather than to the race of Frenchmen.",1
4922,"This universe of waiterdom has produced a type whose character is as precisely distinguished as that of the Mongolian. It has a spiritual identity that unites it as no mere feelings of patriotism could ever do. And this spiritual identity--a unity of thought, of purpose, and of conduct--has produced unmistakable physical characteristics. After George became aware of this, he got so that he could recognise a waiter no matter where he saw him, whether in the New York subway or on a Paris bus or in the streets of London. He tested his observation many times by accosting men he suspected of being waiters and engaging them in conversation, and nine times out of ten he found that his guess had been right. Something in the feet and legs gave them away, something in the way they moved and walked and stood. It was not merely that these men had spent most of their lives standing on their feet and hurrying from kitchen to table in the execution of their orders. Other classes of men, such as policemen, also lived upon their feet, and yet no one could mistake a policeman in mufti for a waiter. (The police of all countries, George discovered, formed another separate race.)",1
4923,"The gait of an old waiter can best be described as gingery. It is a kind of gouty shuffle, painful, rheumatic, and yet expertly nimble, too, as if the man has learned by every process of experience to save his feet. It is the nimbleness that comes from years of ""Yes, sir. Right away, sir,"" or of ""Oui, monsieur. Je viens. Toute de suite. It is the gait of service, of despatch, of incessant haste to be about one's orders, and somehow the whole soul and mind and character of the waiter is in it.",1
4924,"If one wishes an instant insight into the emotional and spiritual differences between the race of waiters and the race of policemen, all one needs to do is to observe the gaits of each. Compare a waiter as he approaches a table at the peremptory command of an impatient customer, and a policeman, whether in New York, London, Paris, or Berlin, as he approaches the scene of a disorder or accident. A man is lying stretched out on the pavement, let us say: he has had a heart attack, or has been struck by a motor-car, or has been assaulted and beaten by thugs. People are standing round in a circle. Watch the policeman as he comes up. Does he hurry? Does he rush to the scene? Does he come forward with the quick, shuffling, eager, and solicitous movement of the waiter? He does not. He advances deliberately, ponderously, with a heavy and flat-footed tread, taking the scene in slowly as he approaches, with an appraising and unrelenting look. He is coming not to take orders but to give them. He is coming to assume command of the situation, to investigate, to disperse the crowd, to do the talking, and not to be talked to. His whole bearing expresses a certain primitive brutality of vested authority, as well as all the other related mental and spiritual qualities that proceed from the exercise of licensed power. And in all these things which issue from his own peculiar vision of life and of the world, he is almost the exact reverse of the waiter.",1
4925,"Since this is true, can anyone doubt that waiters and policemen belong to separate races? Does it not follow that a French waiter is more closely akin to a German waiter than to a French gendarme? Mynheer Bendien had attracted George's interest from the first. It was not merely that he was Dutch. That fact was unmistakable. He had a Halsian floridity, a Halsian heartiness and gusto, a Halsian heaviness--a kind of Dutch grossness that is quite different from German grossness in that it is mixed with a certain delicacy, or rather smallness. This delicacy or smallness is most often evident in the expression and shape of the mouth. So, now, with Mynheer Bendien. His lip was full and pouting, but also a little prim and smug. It was the characteristic Dutch lip--the lip of a small and cautious people, with a very good notion about which side their bread is buttered on. In any town throughout Holland one can see them behind the shuttered windows of their beautiful and delicate houses--see them quietly and privily enjoying the very best of everything and smacking those full, pouting, sensual little lips together.",1
4926,"Holland is a wonderful little country, and the Dutch are a wonderful little people. Just the same it is a little country, they are a little people, and George did not like little countries or little people. For in the look of those little, fat, wet, pouting mouths there is also something cautious and self-satisfied, something that kept nicely out of war in 1914 while its neighbours were bleeding to death, something that feathered its nest and fattened its purse at the expense of dying men, something that maintained itself beautifully clean, beautifully prim, and beautifully content to live very quietly and simply in those charming, beautiful houses, without any show or fuss whatever upon the best of everything.",1
4927,"In all these respects Mynheer Bendien was indubitably Dutch. But he was also something else as well, and this was what made George observe him with fascinated interest. For, alongside his Dutchness, he also wore that type look which George had come to recognise as belonging to the race of small business men. It was a look which he had discovered to be common to all members of this race whether they lived in Holland, England, Germany, France, the United States, Sweden, or Japan. There was a hardness and grasping quality in it that showed in the prognathous jaw. There was something a little sly and tricky about the eyes, something a little amoral in the sleekness of the flesh, something about the slightly dry concavity of the face and its vacuous expression in repose which indicated a grasping self-interest and a limited intellectual life. It was the kind of face that is often thought of as American. But it was not American. It belonged to no nationality. It belonged simply and solely to the race of small business men everywhere.",1
4928,"He was obviously the kind of man who would have found an instant and congenial place for himself among his fellow business men in Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, or Kalamazoo. He would have felt completely at home at one of the weekly luncheons of the Rotary Club. He would have chewed his cigar with the best of them, wagged his head approvingly as the president spoke of some member as having ""both feet on the ground"", entered gleefully into all the horseplay, the heavy-handed kind of humour known as ""kidding"", and joined in the roars of laughter that greeted such master-strokes of wit as collecting all the straw hats in the cloak-room, bringing them in, throwing them on the floor, and gleefully stamping them to pieces. He would also have nodded his red face in bland agreement as the speaker aired again all the quackery about ""service"", ""the aims of Rotary"", and its ""plans for world peace"".",1
4929,"George could easily imagine Mynheer Bendien pounding across the continental breadth of the United States in one of the crack trains, striking up a conversation with other men of substance in the smoking room of the pullman car, pulling fat cigars from his pocket and offering them to his new-found companions, chewing on his own approvingly and nodding with ponderous affirmation as someone said: ""I was talking to a man in Cleveland the other day, one of the biggest glue and mucilage producers in the country, a fellow who has learned his business from the ground up and knows what he's talking about---- Yes, Mynheer Bendien would have recognised his brother, his kinsman, his twin spirit wherever he found him,, and would instantly have established a connection and a footing of proper familiarity with him, as McHarg and Webber could never have done, even though the stranger might be an American like themselves. George knew McHarg's antipathy for this kind of man. It was an antipathy which he had savagely expressed in swingeing and satiric fiction--an antipathy which, George had felt, had a quality of almost affectionate concern in its hatred, but which was hatred nonetheless. Why, then, had McHarg invited this man to his room? Why had he sought out his companionship?",1
4930,"The reason became plain enough as he thought about it. Although McHarg and Webber could never belong to Bendien's world, there was something of Bendien in both of them--more in McHarg, perhaps, than in himself. Though they belonged to separate worlds, there was still another world to which each of them could find a common entry. This was the world of natural humanity, the world of the earthly, eating, drinking, companionable, and company-loving man. Every artist feels the need of this world desperately. His nature is often torn between opposing poles of loneliness and gregariousness. Isolation he must have to do his work. But fellowship is also a necessity without which he is lost, since the lack of it removes him from all the naturalness of life which he demands more than any other man alive, and which he must share in if he is to grow and prosper in his art. But his need for companionship often betrays him through its very urgency. His hunger and thirst for life often lay him open to the stupidity of fools and the trickery and dishonesty of Philistines and rascals.",1
4931,"George could see what had happened to McHarg. He himself had gone through the same experience many times. McHarg, it is true, was a great man, a man famous throughout the world, a man who had now attained the highest pinnacle of success to which a writer could aspire. But on just this account his disillusionment and disappointment must have been so much the greater and the more crushing.",1
4932,"And what disillusionment, what disappointment, was this? It was a disappointment that all men know--the artist most of all--The disappointment of reaching for the flower and having it fade the moment your fingers touch it. It was the disappointment that comes from the artist's invincible and unlearning youth, from the spirit of indomitable hope and unwavering adventure, the spirit that is defeated and cast down ten thousand times but that is lost beyond redemption never, the spirit that, so far from learning wisdom from despair, acceptance from defeat, cynicism from disillusionment, seems to grow stronger at every rebuff, more passionate in its convictions the older it grows, more assured of its ultimate triumphant fulfilment the more successive and conclusive its defeats.",1
4933,"McHarg had accepted his success and his triumph with the exultant elation of a boy. He had received the award of his honorary degree, symbolising the consummation of his glory, with blazing images of impossible desire. And then, almost before he knew it, it was over. The thing was his, it had been given to him, he had it, he had stood before the great ones of the earth, he had been acclaimed and lauded, all had happened--and yet, nothing had happened.",1
4934,"Then, of course, he took the inevitable next step. With a mind surcharged with frre, with a heart thirsting for some impossible fulfilment, he took his award, and copies of all the speeches, programmes, and tributes, sailed for Europe, and began to go from place to place; looking for something that he had no name for, something that existed somewhere, perhaps--but where he did not know. He went to Copenhagen--wine, women, aquavit, and members of the Press, then women, wine, members of the Press, and aquavit again. He went to Berlin--members of the Press, wine, women, whisky, women, wine, and members of the Press. So then to Vienna--women, wine, whisky, members of the Press. Finally to Baden-Baden for a ""cure""--cure, call it, if you will, for wine, women, and members of the Press--cure, really, for life-hunger, for life-thirst, for life-triumph, for life-defeat, life-disillusionment, life-loneliness, and lifeboredom--cure for devotion to men and for disgust of them, cure for love of life and for weariness of it--last of all, cure for the cureless, cure for the worm, for the flame, for the feeding mouth, for the thing that eats and rests not ever till we die. Is there not some medicine for the irremediable? Give us a cure, for God's sake, for what ails us! Take it! Keep it! Give it back again! Oh, let us have it! Take it from us, damn you, but for God's sake bring it back! And so good night.",1
4935,"Therefore this wounded lion, this raging cat of life, forever prowling past a million portals of desire and destiny, had flung himself against the walls of Europe, seeking, hunting, thirsting, starving, and lashing himself into a state of frenzied bafflement, and at last had met--a red-faced Dutchman from the town of Amsterdam, and had knocked about with the red-faced Dutchman for three days on end, and now hates red-faced Dutchman's guts and would to God that he could pitch him out of the window, bag and baggage, and wonders how in God's name the whole thing began, and how he can ever win free from it and be alone again--and so now is here, pacing the carpet of his hotel room in London. The presence of Mr. Donald Stoat was more puzzling. Mynheer Bendien at least had a certain earthy congeniality to recommend him to McHarg's interest. Mr. Stoat had nothing. Everything about the man was calculated to rub McHarg the wrong way. He was pompous and pretentious, his judgments, such as they were, were governed by a kind of moral bigotry that was infuriating, and, to cap it all, he was a complete and total fool.",1
4936,"He had inherited from his father a publishing business with a good name and a record of respected accomplishment. Under his leadership it had degenerated into a business largely devoted to the fabrication of religious tracts and text-books for the elementary grades. Its fiction list was pitiful. Mr. Stoat's literary and critical standards were derived from a pious devotion to the welfare of the jeune fille. Is it a book,"" he would whisper hoarsely to any aspiring new author, at the same time rolling his eyebrows about--""is it a book that you would be willing for your young daughter to read? Mr. Stoat had no young daughter, but in his publishing enterprises he always acted on the hypothesis that he did have, and that no book should be printed which he would be unwilling to place in her hands. The result, as may be imagined, was fudge and taffy, slop and goo.",1
4937,"George had met Mr. Stoat quite casually some years before he had later been invited to his house. He was married to a large, full-bosomed female with a grim jaw who wore a perpetually frozen grin round the edges of her mouth and eyeglasses which were attached to a cord of black silk. This formidable lady was devoted to art and had not let her marriage to Mr. Stoat interfere with that devotion. Indeed she had not let marriage interfere even with her name, but had clung to her resounding maidenly title of Cornelia Fosdick Sprague. She and Mr. Stoat maintained a salon, to which a great many people who shared Cornelia Fosdick Sprague's devotion to art repaired at regular intervals, and it was to one of these meetings of the elect that George had been invited. He still remembered it vividly. Mr. Stoat had telephoned him a few days after their first casual meeting and had pressed the invitation upon him.",1
4938,"You must come, my boy,"" Mr. Stoat had wheezed over the wire. You can't afford to miss this, you know. Henrietta Saltonstall Spriggins is going to be there. You must meet her. And Penelope Buchanan Pipgrass is going to give a reading from her poems. And Hortense Delancey McCracken is going to read her latest play. You simply must come, by all means. So urged, George accepted and went, and it was quite an occasion.",1
4939,"Mr. Stoat met him at the door and with a pontifical flourish of the eyebrows led him into the presence of Cornelia Fosdick Sprague. After he had made his obeisances Mr. Stoat piloted the young man about the room and with repeated flourishes of the eyebrows introduced him to the other guests. There was an astonishing number of formidable-looking females, and, like the imposing Cornelia, most of them had three names. As Mr. Stoat made the introductions he fairly smacked his lips over the triple-barrelled sonority of their titles.",1
4940,"George noticed with amazement that all of these women bore a marked resemblance to Cornelia Fosdick Sprague. Not that they really looked like her in feature. Some were tall, some were short, some were angular, some were fat, but all of them had a certain overwhelming quality in their bearing. This quality became a crushing air of absolute assurance and authority when they spoke of art. And they spoke of art a great deal. Indeed, it was the purpose of these meetings to speak of art. Almost all of these ladies were not only interested in art, but were ""artists"" themselves. That is to say, they were writers. They wrote one-act plays for the Little Theatre, or they wrote novels, or essays and criticism, or poems and books for children.",1
4941,"Henrietta Saltonstall Spriggins read one of her wee stories for tiny tots about a little girl waiting for Prince Charming. Penelope Buchanan Pipgrass read some of her poems, one about a quaint organ-grinder, and another about a whimsical old rag man. Hortense Delancey McCracken read her play, a sylvan fantasy laid in Central Park, with two lovers sitting on a bench in the springtime and Pan prancing round in the background, playing mad music on his pipes and leering slyly out at the lovers from behind trees. In all of these productions there was not a line that could bring the blush of outraged modesty to the cheek of the most innocent young girl. Indeed, the whole thing was just too damned delightful for words.",1
4942,"After the readings they all sat round and drank pale tea and discussed what they had read in fluty voices. George remembered vaguely that there were two or three other men present, but they were pallid figures who faded into the mist, hovering in the background like wan ghosts, submissive and obscure attendants, husbands even, to the possessors of those sonorous and triple-barrelled names. George never went back again to Cornelia Fosdick Sprague's salon, and had seen nothing more of Mr. Donald Stoat. Yet here he was, the last person in the world he would have expected to find in Lloyd McHarg's apartment. If Mr. Stoat had ever read any of McHarg's books--a most improbable circumstance--his moral conscience must have been outraged by the mockery with which, in almost every one of them, McHarg had assaulted the cherished ideals and sacred beliefs that Mr. Stoat held dear. Yet here he was sipping his dry sherry in McHarg's room with all the aplomb of one who was accustomed to such familiar intimacy.",1
4943,What was he doing here? What on earth did it mean? George did not have to wait long for an answer. The telephone rang. McHarg snapped his fingers sharply and sprang for the instrument with an exclamation of overwrought relief.,1
4944,"Hello, hello! He waited a moment, his inflamed and puckered face twisted wryly to one side. Hello, hello, hello! he said feverishly and rattled the receiver hook. Yes, yes. Who? Where? A brief pause. Oh, it's New York,"" he cried, and then impatiently: ""All right, then! Put them through!""  George had never before seen the transatlantic telephone in operation, and he watched with feelings of wonder and disbelief.",1
4945,"A vision of the illimitable seas passed through his mind. He remembered storms that he had been in and the way great ships were tossed about; he thought of the enormous curve of the earth's surface and of the difference in time; and yet in a moment McHarg, his voice calm now, began to speak quietly as if he were talking to someone in the next room: Oh, hello Wilson,"" he said. Yes, I can hear you perfectly. Of course... Yes, yes, it's true. Of course it is! he cried, with a return to his former manner of feverish annoyance. No, I've broken with him completely... No, I don't know where I'm going. I haven't signed up with anyone yet... All right, all right,"" impatiently. Wait a minute,"" he said curtly. Let me do the talking. I won't do anything until I see you... No that's not a promise to go with you,"" he said angrily. It's just a promise that I won't go anywhere else till I see you. A moment's pause while McHarg listened intently. You're sailing when?...Oh, to-night! The Berengaria. Good. I'll see you here then next week... All right. Good-bye, Wilson,"" he snapped, and hung up.",1
4946,"Turning away from the phone, he was silent a moment, looking a little rueful in his wry, puckered way. Then, with a shrug of his shoulders and a little sigh, he said:  ""Well, cat's out of the bag, I guess. The news has got round. They all know I've left Bradford-Howell. I suppose they'll all be on my tail now. That was Wilson Fothergill,"" he said, mentioning the name of one of America's largest publishers. He's sailing to-night. Suddenly his face was twisted with demonic glee. He laughed a high, dry cackle. Christ, Georgie!"" he squeaked, prodding Webber in the ribs. Isn't it wonderful? Isn't it marvellous? Can you beat it?""  Mr. Donald Stoat cleared his throat with premonitory emphasis and arched his eyebrows significantly.",1
4947,"I hope,"" he said, ""that before you come to any terms with Fothergill, you will talk to me and listen to what I have to say. There was a weighty pause, then he concluded pontifically: ""Stoat--the House of Stoat--would like to have you on its list. What's that?",1
4948,"What's that?"" said McHarg feverishly. Stoat! he cried suddenly. Stoat? He winced nervously in a kind of convulsion of jangled nerves, then paused, trembling and undecided, as if he did not know whether to spring upon Mr. Stoat or to spring out the window. Snapping his bony fingers sharply, he turned to Webber and shrieked again in a shrill, falsetto cackle: ""Did you hear it, Georgie? Isn't it wonderful? K-k-k-k-k--Stoat! he squeaked, prodding Webber in the ribs again. The House of Stoat! Can you beat it? Isn't it marvellous? Isn't it--All right, all right,"" he said, breaking off abruptly and turning upon the astounded Mr. Stoat. All right, Mr. Stoat, we'll talk about it. But some other time. Come in to see me next week,"" he said feverishly.",1
4949,"With that he grasped Mr. Stoat by the hand, shook it in farewell, and with his other arm practically lifted that surprised gentleman from his chair and escorted him across the room. Good-bye, goodbye! Come in next week... Good-bye, Bendien! he now said to the Dutchman, seizing him by the hand, lifting him from the chair, and repeating the process. He herded the two before him with his bony arms outstretched as if he were shooing chickens, and finally got them out of the door, talking rapidly all the time, saying: ""Goodbye, good-bye. Thanks for coming in. Come back to see me again. Georgie and I have to go to lunch now. At last he closed the door on them, turned, and came back in the room.",1
4950,"He was obviously unstrung.  35. A Guest in Spite of Himself When Bendien and Stoat were so suddenly and unceremoniously ushered from the room, George rose from his chair in some excitement, not knowing what to do with himself. McHarg now looked at him wearily.",1
4951,"Sit down, sit down! McHarg gasped, and fell into a chair. He crossed his bony legs with a curiously pathetic and broken attitude. Christ! he said, letting out a long sigh, ""I'm tired. I feel as if I've been run through a sausage grinder. That damned Dutchman! I went out with him in Amsterdam, and we've been going it ever since. God, I can't remember having eaten since I left Cologne. That was four days ago. He looked it, too.",1
4952,"George was sure that he had spoken the literal truth and that he had not paused to eat for days. He was a wreck of jangled nerves and utterly exhausted weariness. As he sat there with his bony shanks crossed like two pieces of limp string, his gaunt figure had the appearance of being broken in two at the waist. He looked as if he would never be able to get out of that chair again without assistance. Just at that moment, however, the telephone rang sharply, and McHarg leaped up as if he had received an electric shock.",1
4953,"Jesus Christ! he shrilled. What's that? He darted for the phone, snatched it up savagely, and snapped: ""Hello, who's there? Then feverishly but very cordially: ""Oh, hello; hello, Rick--you bastard, you! Where the hell have you been, anyway? I've been trying to reach you all morning... No! No! I just got here last night... Of course I'm going to see you. That's one of the reasons I'm here... No, no, you don't need to come for me. I've got my own car here. We'll drive down. I'm bringing someone with me...Who?"" he cackled suddenly in his shrill falsetto. You'll see, you'll see. Wait till we get there... For dinner? Sure, I'll make it. How long does it take?...Two hours and a half? Seven o'clock. We'll be there with time to spare. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What's the address? Wait till I get it down. He seated himself abruptly at the writing-desk, fumbled for a moment with pen and paper, and then passed them impatiently towards George, saying: ""Write it down, George, as I give it to you.",1
4954,"The address was in Surrey, a farm on a country road several miles away from a small town. The directions for finding it were quite complicated, involving detours and cross-roads, but George finally got it all down correctly. Then McHarg, feverishly assuring his host that they would be there for dinner, with time to spare, hung up.",1
4955,"Well, now,"" he said impatiently, springing to his feet with another exhibition of that astounding vitality which seemed to burn in him all the time, ""come on, Georgie! Let's snap out of it! We'll have to get going!""  ""W-w-w-we?",1
4956,"George stammered. Y-y-y-you mean me, Mr. McHarg?""  ""Sure, sure! McHarg said impatiently. Rick's expecting us to dinner. We can't keep him waiting. Come on! Come on! Let's get started! We're getting out of London! We're going places!""  ""P-p-p-places?",1
4957,"George stammered again, dumbfounded. But w-w-w-where are we going, Mr. McHarg? West of England,"" he barked out instantly.",1
4958,"We'll go down to Rick's and spend the night. But to-morrow--to-morrow,"" he muttered, pacing up and down and speaking with ominous decision, ""we'll be on our way. West of England,"" he muttered again, pacing and hanging to his coat lapels with bony fingers. Cathedral towns,"" he said. Bath, Bristol, Wells, Exeter, Salisbury, Devonshire, coast of Cornwall,"" he cried feverishly, getting his geography and his cathedrals hopelessly confused, but covering, nevertheless, a large portion of the kingdom in a single staccato sentence. Keep out of cities,"" he went on. Stay away from swank hotels--joints like this one. Hate them. Hate all of them. Want the country--the English countryside,"" he said with relish.",1
4959,"George's heart sank. He had not bargained for anything like this. He had come to England to finish his new book. The work had been going well. He had established the beat and cadence of daily hours at his writing, and the prospect of breaking the rhythm of it just when he was going at full swing was something that he dreaded. Moreover, God only knew where such a jaunt as McHarg spoke of would end. McHarg, meanwhile, was still talking, pacing nervously back and forth and letting his enthusiasm mount as his mind built up the idyllic picture of what he had suddenly taken it into his head to do.",1
4960,"Yes, the English countryside--that's the thing,"" he said with relish. We'll put up at night by the side of the road and cook our own meals, or stay at some old inn--some real English country inn,"" he said with deliberate emphasis. Tankards of musty ale,"" he muttered. A well-done chop by the fireside. A bottle of old port, eh Georgie?"" he cried, his scorched face lighting up with great glee. Did it all before one time. Toured the whole country several years ago with my wife. Used a trailer. Went from place to place. Slept in our trailer at night and did our own cooking. Wonderful! Marvellous! he barked. The real way to see the country. The only way. George said nothing.",1
4961,"At the moment he was unable to say anything. For weeks he had looked forward to his meeting with McHarg. He had leaped to his bidding when McHarg had summoned him to get out of bed instantly and come to lunch. But he had never dreamed of being abducted as a travelling and talking companion on an expedition that might last for days and even weeks, and end up almost anywhere. He had no desire or intention of going with McHarg if he could avoid it. And yet--his mind groped frantically for a way out--what was he to do? He did not want to offend him. He had too great an admiration and respect for McHarg to do anything that might, wittingly or unwittingly, hurt him or wound his feelings. And how could he reject the invitation of a man who, with the most generous and unselfish enthusiasm, had used the power and elevation of his high place to try to lift him out of the lower channel in which his own life ran?",1
4962,"In spite of the brevity of their acquaintance, George had already seen dearly and unmistakably what a good and noble human being McHarg really was. He knew how much integrity and courage and honesty was contained in that tormented tenement of fury and lacerated hurts. Regardless of all that was jangled, snarled, and twisted in his life, regardless of all that had become bitter, harsh, and acrid, McHarg was obviously one of the truly good, the truly high, the truly great people of the world. Anyone with an atom of feeling and intelligence, George thought, must have seen this at once. And as he continued to watch and study McHarg, and took in again the shock of his appearance--the inflamed face, the poached blue eyes, the emaciated figure and nervously shaking hands--an image flashed into his mind which seemed to represent the essential quality of the man, and this, curiously, was the image of Abraham Lincoln. Save for McHarg's tallness and gauntness, there was no physical similarity to Lincoln. The resemblance came, George thought, from a certain homely identity, from a kind of astonishing ugliness which was so marked that it was hard to see how it escaped the grotesque, and yet it was not grotesque. It was an ugliness which somehow, no matter what extravagances of gesture, tone, and manner McHarg indulged in, never lost its quality of enormous, latent dignity. This strange and troubling resemblance became strikingly evident in repose.",1
4963,"For now, his decision having been arrived at with explosive violence, McHarg sat quietly in a chair, his bony legs crossed lankly, and with the fingers of one freckled and large-knuckled hand fumbled in the breast pocket of his coat for his cheque-book and his wallet. He got them out at last, his hands still shaking as with palsy, but even that did not disturb the suggestion of quiet dignity and strength. He put wallet and cheque-book on his knees, fumbled in a pocket of his vest, took out an old, worn spectacle-case, snapped it open, and deliberately extracted a pair of spectacles. They were the most extraordinary spectacles George had ever seen. They looked as if they might have belonged to Washington, or to Franklin, or to Lincoln himself. The rims, the nose clasp, and the handles were of plain old silver. McHarg opened them carefully, and then, using both hands, slowly adjusted them and settled the handles over his large and freckled ears. This done, he bent his head, took up the wallet, opened it, and very carefully began to count the contents. The transforming effect of this simple act was astonishing. The irritable, rasping, overwrought man of a few minutes before was gone completely. This lank and ugly figure in the chair, with its silver-rimmed spectacles, its wry and puckered face lowered in calculation, its big bony hands deliberately fingering each note inside the wallet, was an image of Yankee shrewdness, homely strength, plain dignity, and assured power. His very tone had changed. Still counting his money, without lifting his head, he spoke to George, saying quietly:  ""Ring that bell over there, George.",1
4964,"We'll have to get some more money. I'll send John out to the bank. George rang, and shortly the young man with buttons rapped at the door and entered.",1
4965,"McHarg glanced up and, opening his chequebook and, taking out his fountain pen, said quietly:  ""I need some money, John. Will you take this cheque round to the bank and cash it? Very good, sir,"" said John.",1
4966,"And 'Enry is 'ere, sir, with the car. 'E wants to know if 'e should wait. Yes,"" said McHarg, still writing out the cheque.",1
4967,"Tell him I'll need him. Tell him we'll be ready in twenty minutes. He tore out the cheque and handed it to the man. And by the way,"" he said, ""when you come back will you pack some things--shirts, underwear, socks, and so on--in a small bag? We're going out of town. Very good, sir,"" John said quietly, and went out.",1
4968,"McHarg was silent and thoughtful for a moment. Then he capped his fountain pen, restored it to his pocket, put away his wallet and cheque-book, took off his old spectacles with the same grave and patient movement, folded them and laid them in the case, snapped it to and put it in the pocket of his vest, and then, with a much quieter and more genial friendliness than he had yet displayed, brought one hand down smartly on the arm of his chair and said:  ""Well, George, what are you doing now? Working on another book?""  Webber told him that he was.",1
4969,"Going to be good?"" he demanded. Webber said he hoped so. A nice, big, fat one like the first? Lots of meat on it, is there? Lots of people?""  Webber told him that there would be.",1
4970,"That's the stuff,"" he said. Go to it and give 'em people,"" he said quietly. You've got the feeling for 'ern. You know how to make 'em live. Go on and put 'em in. You'll hear a lot of bunk,"" he went on. You've probably heard it already. There'll be a lot of bright young men who will tell you how to write, and tell you that what you do is wrong. They'll tell you that you have no style, no sense of form. They'll tell you that you don't write like Virginia Woolf, or like Proust, or like Gertrude Stein, or like someone else that you ought to write like. Take it all in, as much of it as you can. Believe all of it that you're able to believe. Try to get all the help from it you can, but if you know it's not true, don't pay too much attention to it. Will you be able to know whether it's true or not?""  ""Oh, yes,"" he said quietly.",1
4971,"You always know if it's true. Christ, man, you're a writer, you're not a bright young man. If you were a bright young man you wouldn't know whether it was true or not. You'd only say you did. But a writer always knows. The bright young men don't think he does. That's the reason they're bright young men. They think a writer is too dumb or too pig-headed to listen to what they say, but the real truth of the matter is that the writer knows much more about it than they can ever know. Once in a while they say something that hits the nail on the head. But that's only one time in a thousand. When they do, it hurts, but it's worth listening to. It's probably something that you knew about yourself, that you knew you'd have to look at finally, but that you've been trying to dodge and that you hoped no one else would discover. When they punch one of those raw nerves, listen to them, even though its hurts like hell. But usually you'll find that you've known everything they say a long time before they say it, and that what they think is important doesn't amount to a damn. Then what's a man to do?",1
4972,"Webber said. It looks pretty much as if he's got to be his own doctor, doesn't it? It looks as if he's got to find the answer for himself. I never found any other way,"" said McHarg.",1
4973,"I don't think you will, either. So get going. Keep busy. For Christ's sake, don't freeze up. Don't stall around. I've known a lot of young fellows who froze up after their first book, and it wasn't because they had only that one book in them, either. That's what the bright young men thought. That's what they always think, but it just ain't true. Good God, man, you've got a hundred books in you! You can keep on turning them out as long as you live. There's no danger of your drying up. The only danger is of freezing up. How do you mean?",1
4974,"Why should a man freeze up?""  ""Usually,"" said McHarg, ""because he loses his nerve. He listens to the bright young men. His first book gets him pretty good reviews. He takes them seriously. He begins to worry about every little bit of criticism that's sandwiched in with the praise. He begins to wonder if he can do it again. His next book is really going to be 'as good as his first, maybe better. He has been a natural slugger to begin with, with a one-ton punch. Now he begins to shadow-box. He listens to everything they tell him. How to jab and how to hook. How to counter with his right. How to keep out of the way. How to weave and how to bob. How to take care of his feet. He learns to skip the rope, but forgets to use that paralysing punch that he was born with, and the first thing you know some palooka comes along and knocks him for a row of ash-cans. For God's sake, don't let it happen to you. Learn all you can. Improve all you can. Take all the instruction you can absorb. But remember that no amount of instruction can ever take the place of the wallop in the old right hand. If you lose that, you may learn all the proper ways that other men have used to do the job, but you'll have forgotten your own way. As a writer, you'll be through. So for God's sake, get going and keep going. Don't let them slow you down. Make your mistakes, take your chances, look silly, but keep on going. Don't freeze up. You think that can happen?",1
4975,"Do you think a man can freeze up if he really has talent? Yes,"" McHarg said quietly, ""that can happen. I've seen it happen. You'll find out, as you go on, that most of the things they say, most of the dangers that they warn you of, do not exist. They'll talk to you, for instance, about prostituting your talent. They'll warn you not to write for money. Not to sell your soul to Hollywood. Not to do a dozen other things that have nothing whatever to do with you or with your life. You won't prostitute yourself. A man's talent doesn't get prostituted just because someone waves a fat cheque in his face. If your talent is prostituted, it is because you are a prostitute by nature. The number of writers in this world who weep into their Scotch and tell you of the great books they would have written if they hadn't sold out to Hollywood or to the Saturday Evening Post is astonishingly large. But the number of great writers who have sold out is not large. In fact, I don't believe there are any at all. If Thomas Hardy had been given a contract to write stories for the Saturday Evening Post, do you think he would have written like Zane Grey or like Thomas Hardy? I can tell you the answer to that one. He would have written like Thomas Hardy. He couldn't have written like anyone else but Thomas Hardy. He would have kept on writing like Thomas Hardy whether he wrote for the Saturday Evening Post or Captain Billy's Whizbang. You can't prostitute a great writer, because a great writer will inevitably be himself. He couldn't sell himself out if he wanted to. And a good many of them, I suppose, have wanted to, or thought they did. But he can freeze up. He can listen too much to the bright young men. He can learn to shadow-box, to feint and jab and weave, and he can lose his punch. So whatever you do, don't freeze up. There was a rap at the door, and in response to McHarg's summons John came in, carrying in his hand a bundle of crisp, brand-new Bank of England notes.",1
4976,"I think you will find these right, sir,"" he said, as he handed the money to McHarg. I counted them. One 'undred pounds, sir.""  McHarg took the notes, folded them into a wad, and thrust it carelessly into his pocket.",1
4977,"All right, John,"" he said. And now will you pack a few things? He got up, looked about him absently, and then, with a sudden resumption of his former feverish manner, he barked out:  ""Well, George, get on your coat!",1
4978,"We've got to be on our way!""  ""B-b-but""--George began to temporise--""don't you think we'd better get some lunch before we start out, Mr. McHarg? If you haven't eaten for so long, you'll need food. Let's go somewhere now and get something to eat. George spoke with all the persuasiveness he could put into his voice.",1
4979,"By this time he was beginning to feel very hungry, and thought longingly of the ""prime bit"" of gammon and peas that Mrs. Purvis had prepared for him. Also he hoped that if he could only get McHarg to have lunch before starting, he could use the occasion diplomatically to dissuade him from his intention of departing forthwith, and taking him along willy-nilly, on a tour that was apparently designed to embrace a good portion of the British Isles. But McHarg, as if he foresaw Webber's design, and also feared, perhaps, the effect of further delay upon his almost exhausted energies, snapped curtly, with inflexible decision:  ""We'll eat somewhere on the road.",1
4980,"We're getting out of town at once. George saw that it was useless to argue, so he said nothing more. He decided to go along, wherever McHarg was going, and to spend the night, if need be, at his friend's house in the country, trusting in the hope that the restorative powers of a good meal and a night's sleep would help to alter McHarg's purpose. Therefore he put on his coat and hat, descended with McHarg in the lift, waited while he left some instructions at the desk, and then went out with him to the automobile that was standing at the kerb.",1
4981,"McHarg had chartered a Rolls-Royce. When George saw this magnificent car he felt like roaring with laughter, for if this was the vehicle in which he proposed to explore the English countryside, cooking out of a frying-pan and sleeping beside the road at night, then the tour would certainly be the most sumptuous and the most grotesque vagabondage England had ever seen. John had already come down and had stowed away a small suitcase on the floor beside the back seat. The driver, a little man dressed appropriately in livery, touched the visor of his cap respectfully, and he and George helped McHarg into the car. He had suddenly gone weak, and almost fell as he got in. Once in, he asked George to give the driver the address in Surrey, and, having said this, he collapsed: his face sank forward on his chest, and he had again that curious broken-in-two look about the waist. He had one hand thrust through the loop of a strap beside the door, and if it had not been for this support he would have slumped to the floor. George got in and sat down beside him, still wondering desperately what to do, how in the name of God he was going to get out of it.",1
4982,"It was well after one o'clock when they started off. They rolled smoothly into St. James's Street, turned at the bottom into Pall Mall, went round St. James's Palace and into the Mall, and headed towards Buckingham Palace and Webber's own part of town. Coming out of the Mall and wheeling across the great place before the palace, McHarg roused himself with a jerk, peered through the drizzle and the reek--it was a dreary day--at the magnificent sentries stamping up and down in front of the palace, stamping solemnly, facing at the turns, and stamping back again, and was just about to slump back when George caught him up sharply.",1
4983,"At that moment Ebury Street was very near, and it seemed very dear to him. George thought with desire and longing of his bed, of Mrs. Purvis, and of his untouched gammon and peas. That morning's confident departure already seemed to be something that had happened long ago. He smiled bitterly as he remembered his conversation with Mrs. Purvis and their speculations about whether Mr. McHarg would take him to lunch at the Ritz, or at Stone's in Panton Street, or at Simpson's in the Strand. Gone now were all these Lucullan fantasies. At that point he would joyfully have compromised on a pub and a piece of cheese and a pint of bitter beer.",1
4984,"As the car wheeled smoothly past the palace, he felt his last hope slipping away. Desperately he jogged his companion by the elbow before it should be too late and told him he lived just round the corner in Ebury Street, and could he please stop off a moment there to get a tooth-brush and a safety-razor, that it would take only a minute. McHarg meditated this request gravely and finally mumbled that he could, but to ""make it snappy"". Accordingly, George gave the driver the address, and they drove down round the palace, turned into Ebury Street, and slowed down as they approached his modest little house. McHarg was beginning to look desperately ill. He hung on grimly to his strap, but when the car stopped he swayed in his seat and would have gone down if George had not caught him.",1
4985,"Mr. McHarg,"" George said, ""you ought to have something to eat before we go on farther. Won't you come upstairs with me and let the woman give you something? She has fixed me a good lunch. It's all ready. We could eat and be out again in twenty minutes. No food,"" he muttered and glared at George suspiciously.",1
4986,"What are you trying to do--run out on me?""  ""No, of course not. Well, get your tooth-brush then, and hurry up. We're going to get out of town. All right.",1
4987,Only I think you're making a mistake not to eat first. It's there waiting for you if you'll take it. George made it as persuasive as he could.,1
4988,"He stood at the open door, with one foot upon the running-board. McHarg made no answer; he lay back against the seat with his eyes closed. But a moment later he tugged on the strap, pulled himself partly erect, and, with just a shade of obstinate concession, said:  ""You got a cup of tea up there?""  ""Of course.",1
4989,"She'll have it for you in two minutes. He pondered this information for a moment, then half unwillingly said: ""Well, I don't know. I might take a cup of tea. Maybe it would brace me up. Come on,"" George said quickly, and took him by the arm.",1
4990,"The driver and George helped him out of the car. George told the man to wait for them, that they would be back within thirty minutes, which McHarg quickly amended to fifteen. Then George opened the street door with his key and, slowly, carefully, helping the exhausted man, began to propel the tall and angular form up the narrow stairs. They finally got there. George opened the door, led him through into his sitting-room, and seated McHarg in his most comfortable chair, where he immediately let his head slump forward on his breast again. George lit the little open gas radiator which provided the room with the only heat it had, called Mrs. Purvis, who had heard them and was already coming from the kitchen, whispered quickly to her the circumstance of his being there and the identity of his distinguished visitor, and dispatched her at once to make the tea.",1
4991,"When she left the sitting-room McHarg roused himself a little and said: ""Georgie, I fell all shot to hell. God, I could sleep a month. I've just sent Mrs. Purvis for the tea,"" George answered.",1
4992,She'll have it ready in a minute. That'll make you feel better.,1
4993,"But almost instantly, as if the effort to speak had used up his last energies, McHarg sank back in the chair and collapsed completely. By the time Mrs. Purvis entered with her tray and teapot, he no longer needed tea. He was buried in comatose oblivion--past tea or travel now, past everything.",1
4994,"She saw instantly what had happened. She put the tray down quietly and whispered to George: ""'E's not goin' anywhere just yet. 'E will be needin' sleep. Yes,"" George said.",1
4995,"That's what he does need, badly. It's a shame to leave 'im in that chair. If we could only get 'im up, sir,"" she whispered, ""and into your room, 'e could lie down in your bed. It'd be more comfortable for 'im.""  George nodded, stooped beside the chair, got one of McHarg's long, dangling arms round his neck and his own arm round McHarg's waist, and, heaving, said encouragingly: ""Come on, Mr. McHarg.",1
4996,"You'll feel better if you lie down and stretch out. He made a manful effort and got out of the chair, and took the few steps necessary to enter the bedroom and reach the bed, where he again collapsed, this time face downwards. George rolled him over on his back, straightened him out, undid his collar, and took off his shoes. Then Mrs. Purvis covered him from the raw chill and cold, which seemed to soak right into the little bedroom from the whole clammy reek of fog and drizzle outside. They piled a number of blankets and comforters upon him, brought in a small electric heat reflector and turned it on in such a way that its warmth would reach him, the they pulled the curtains together at the window, darkened the room, closed the doors, and left him.",1
4997,"Mrs. Purvis was splendid. Mr. McHarg is very tired,"" George said to her. A little sleep will do him good. Ah, yes,"" she said, and nodded wisely and sympathetically.",1
4998,"You can see it's the strain 'e's been under. Meetin' all them people. And then 'avin' to travel so much. It's easy to see,"" she went on loftily, ""that 'e's still sufferin' from the fatigue of the journey. But you,"" she said quickly--""should think you'd feel tired yourself, what with the excitement and 'avin' no lunch and all. Do come,"" she said persuasively, ""and 'ave a bite to eat. The gammon is nice, sir. I could 'ave it for you in a minute. Her proposal had George's enthusiastic endorsement.",1
4999,"She hastened to the kitchen, and soon came in again and told him lunch was ready. He went at once to the little dining-room and ate a hearty meal--gammon, peas, boiled potatoes, a crusty apple tart with a piece of cheese, and a bottle of Bass ale. After that he returned to the sitting-room and decided to stretch out on the sofa. It was a small sofa and much too short for him, but he had had no sleep for more than twenty-four hours and it looked inviting. He lay down with his legs dangling over the end, and almost instantly fell asleep.",1
5000,"Later he was faintly conscious that Mrs. Purvis had come softly in, had put his feet upon a chair, and had spread a blanket over him. He was also dimly aware that she had drawn the curtains, darkened the room, and gone softly out. Later still, as she prepared to leave for the day, George heard her open the door and listen for a moment; then, very quietly, she tiptoed across the floor and opened the bedroom door and peered in. Evidently satisfied that all was well, she tiptoed out again, closing the doors gently as she went. He heard her creep softly down the stairs, and presently the street door closed. He fell asleep again and slept soundly for some time.",1
5001,"When George woke again it had grown completely dark outside, and McHarg was up and stirring about in the bedroom, evidently looking for the light. George got up and switched the light on in the sitting-room, and McHarg came in. Again there was an astonishing transtormation in him. His short sleep seemed to have restored his vitality, and restored it to a degree and in a direction George had not wanted. He had hoped that a few hours of sleep would calm McHarg and make him see the wisdom of getting a really sound rest before proceeding farther on his travels. Instead, the man had wakened like a raging lion, and was now pacing back and forth like a caged beast, fuming at their delay and demanding with every breath that George get ready to depart instantly.",1
5002,"Are you coming?"" he said. Or are you trying to back out of it? What are you going to do, anyway?""  George had waked up in a semi-daze, and he now became conscious that the door-bell was ringing, and had been ringing for some time.",1
5003,"It was probably this sound which had aroused them both. Telling McHarg that he'd be back in a moment, George ran down the stairs and opened the door. It was, of course, McHarg's chauffeur. In the excitement and fatigue of the afternoon's event he had completely forgotten him, and the poor fellow had been waiting all this time there in his glittering chariot drawn up before Webber's modest door. It was not yet quite five o'clock in the afternoon, but dark comes early in the dismal wintry days of London's ceaseless fog and drizzle, and it was black as midnight outside. The street lights were on, and the shop fronts were shining out into the fog with a blurred and misty radiance. The street itself was still and deserted, but high up over the roof-tops the wind was beginning to swoop in fitful gusts, howling faintly in a way that promised a wild night.",1
5004,"The little chauffeur stood patiently before George when he opened the door, holding his visored cap respectfully in his hands, but he had an air of restrained anxiety about him which he could not conceal. I beg your pardon, sir,"" he said, ""but I wonder if you know whether Mr. Mc'Arg 'as changed 'is plans?""  ""Plans? Plans? George stammered, still not quite awake, and he shook his head like a dog coming out of the water in an effort to compose himself and bring order to his own bewilderment. What plans?""  ""About going to Surrey, sir,"" the little man said gently, yet giving George a quick and rather startled look.",1
5005,"Already the painful suspicion, which later in the evening was to become a deep-rooted conviction, that he was alone and under the criminal direction of two dangerous maniacs, had begun to shape itself in the chauffeur's consciousness, but as yet he betrayed his apprehension only by an attitude of solicitous and somewhat tense concern. You know, sir,"" he continued quietly, in a tone of apologetic reminder, ""that's where we started for hearlier in the hafternoon. Oh, yes, yes.",1
5006,"Yes, I remember,"" George said, running his fingers through his hair and speaking rather distractedly. Yes, we did, didn't we?""  ""Yes, sir,"" he said gently. And you see,"" he went on, almost like a benevolent elder speaking to a child--""you see, sir, one is not supposed to park 'ere in the street for so long a time as we've been 'ere. The bobby,"" he coughed apologetically behind his hand, ""'as just spoken to me, sir, and 'as told me that I've been 'ere too long and will 'ave to move. So I thought it best to tell you, sir, and to find out if you know what Mr. Mc'Arg intends to do. I--I think he intends to go on with it,"" George said.",1
5007,"That is, to go on to Surrey as we started out to do. But--you say the bobby has ordered you to move?""  ""Yes, sir,"" the chauffeur said patiently, and held his visored cap and looked up at George and waited. Well, then--"" George thought desperately for a moment, and then burst out: ""Look here, I'll tell you what you do. Drive round the block--drive round the block----""  ""Yes, sir,"" the chauffeur said, and waited.",1
5008,"And come back here in five minutes. I'll be able to tell you then what we're going to do. Very good, sir.",1
5009,"He inclined his head in a brief nod of agreement, put on his cap, and got into his car. George closed the door and went back up the stairs. When he entered the sitting-room, McHarg had on his overcoat and hat and was pacing restlessly up and down.",1
5010,"It was your driver,"" George said. I forgot about him, but he's been waiting there all afternoon. He wants to know what we're going to do. What we're going to do?",1
5011,"McHarg shrilled. We're going to get a move on! Christ Almighty, man, we're four hours late already! Come on, come on, George! he rasped. Let's get going!",1
5012,"George saw that he meant it and that it was useless to try to change his purpose. He took his brief-case, crammed tooth-brush, toothpaste, razor, shaving cream and brush, and a pair of pyjamas into it, put on his hat and coat, switched off the lights, ands led the way into the hall, saying: ""All right. I'm ready if you are. Let's go. When they got out into the foggy drizzle of the street, the car was just wheeling to a halt at the kerb.",1
5013,"The chauffeur jumped out and opened the door for them. McHarg and Webber got in. The chauffeur climbed back into his seat, and they drove swiftly away, down the wet street, with a smooth, cupped hissing of the tyres. They reached Chelsea, skirted the Embankment, crossed Battersea Bridge, and began to roll south-westward through the vast, interminable ganglia of outer London.",1
5014,"It was a journey that Webber remembered later with nightmare vividness. McHarg had begun to collapse again before they crossed the Thames at Battersea. And no wonder! For weeks, in the letdown and emptiness that had come upon him as a sequel to his great success, he had lashed about in a frenzy of seeking for he knew not what, going from place to place, meeting new people, hurling himself into fresh adventures. From this impossible quest he had allowed himself no pause or rest. And at the end of it he had found exactly nothing. Or, to be more exact, he had found Mynheer Bendien in Amsterdam. It was easy to see just what had happened to McHarg after that. For if, at the end of the trail, there was nothing but a red-faced Dutchman, then, by God, he'd at least find out what kind of stuff a red-faced Dutchman was made of. Then for several days more, in his final fury of exasperation, he had put the Dutchman to the test, driving him even harder than he had driven himself, not even stopping to eat, until at last the Dutchman, sustained by gin and his own phlegmatic constitution, had used up what remained of McHarg's seemingly inexhaustible energies. So now he was all in. The flare of new vitality with which he had awakened from his nap had quickly burnt itself out: he lay back in the seat of the car, drained and emptied of the fury which had possessed him, too exhausted even to speak, his eyes closed, his head rolling gently with the motion of the car, his long legs thrust out limply before him. George sat beside him, helpless, not knowing what to do or where he was going or how and when it would end, his gaze fixed upon the head of the little driver, who was hunched up behind the wheel, intent upon the road, steering the car skilfully through the traffic and the fog-bound night.",1
5015,"The enormous ganglia of unending London rolled past them--street after street wet with a dull gleam of rain-fogged lamps, mile after mile of brick houses, which seemed steeped in the fog and soot and grime of uncounted days of dismal weather, district after district in the interminable web, a giant congeries of uncounted villages, all grown together now into this formless, monstrous sprawl. They would pass briefly through the high streets of these far-flung warrens. For a moment there would be the golden nimbus of the fog-blurred lights, the cheerful radiance of butcher shops, with the red brawn of beef, the plucked plumpness and gangling necks of hung fowls, and the butchers in their long white aprons; then the wine and liquor stores, and the beer-fogged blur and warmth and murmur of the pubs, with the dull gleam of the rain-wet pavement stretching out in front; then pea-soup darkness again, and again the endless rows of fog-cheat houses.",1
5016,"At last they began to come to open country. There was the darkness of the land, the smell of the wet fields, the strung spare lights of night across the countryside. They began to feel the force of the wind as it swooped down at them across the fields and shivered against the sides of the car. It was blowing the fog away and the sky was lifting. And now, against the damp, low, thick, and dismal ceiling of the clouds, there was an immense corrupted radiance, as if all the swelter, smoke, and fury of London's unending life had been caught up and resumed there. With every revolution of the wheels the glow receded farther behind them.",1
5017,"And now, with the lonely countryside all round him, George became conscious of the mysterious architecture of night. As he felt the abiding strength and everlastingness of the earth, he began to feel also a sense of exultation and release. It was a feeling he had had many times before, a feeling that every man who lives in a vast modern city must feel when, after months within the hive of the city's life--months of sweat and noise and violence, months of grimy brick and stone, months of the incessant thrust and intershift and weaving of the endless crowd, months of tainted air and tainted life, of treachery, fear, malice, slander, blackmail, envy, hatred, conflict, fury, and deceit, months of frenzy and the tension of wire-taut nerves and the changeless change--he leaves the city and is free at last, out beyond the remotest filament of that tainted and tormented web. He that has known only a jungle of mortared brick and stone where no birds sing, where no blade grows, has now found earth again. And yet, unfathomable enigma that it is, he has found earth and, finding it, has lost the world. He has found the washed cleanliness of vision and of soul that comes from earth. He feels himself washed free of all the stains of ancient living, its evil and its lust, its filth and cruelty, its perverse and ineradicable pollution, But curiously, somehow, the wonder and the mystery of it all remains, its beauty and its magic, its richness and its joy, and as he looks back upon that baleful glow that lights the smoky blanket of the sky, a feeling of loss and loneliness possesses him, as if in gaining earth again he has relinquished life.",1
5018,"The car sped onwards and still onwards, until finally the last outpost of London was left behind and the glow in the sky was gone. They were driving through dark country and night towards their journey's end. McHarg had not uttered a word. He still sat with legs sprawled out and head thrown back, swaying from the motion of the car but held in position by one limp arm which was hooked in the strap beside him. George was getting more and more alarmed at the thought of bringing him in this exhausted state to the house of an old friend whom he had not seen for years. At last he stopped the car and told the driver to wait while he pleaded with his master.",1
5019,"He switched on the overhead light and shook him, and to his surprise McHarg opened his eyes right away and by his responses showed that his mind was completely clear and alert. George told him that, worn out as he must be, he could not possibly enjoy a visit with his friend. He begged him to change his mind, to return to London for the night, to let him telephone his friend from the nearest town to say that he had been delayed and would see him in a day or two, but by all means to defer his visit until he felt better able to make it. After McHarg's former display of obstinate determination, George had little hope of success, but to his amazement McHarg now proved most reasonable. He agreed to everything George said, confessed that he himself thought it would be better not to see his friend that night, and said he was prepared to embrace any alternative George might propose, except--on this he was most blunt and flat--he would not go back to London. All day his desire to get out of London had had the force and urgency of an obsession, so George pressed no further on that point. He agreed that they should not turn back, but asked McHarg if he had any preference about where they should go. McHarg said he didn't care, but after meditating with chin sunk forward on breast for several moments, he said suddenly that he would like the sea.",1
5020,"This remark did not seem at all astonishing to George at the time. It became astonishing only as he thought of it later. He accepted the proposal of going to the sea as naturally as a New Yorker might accept a suggestion of riding on a Fifth Avenue bus to see Grant's tomb. If McHarg had said he wanted to go to Liverpool or to Manchester or to Edinburgh, it would have been the same--George would have felt no astonishment whatever. Once out of London, both of these Americans, in their unconscious minds, were as little impressed by the dimensions of England as they would have been by a half-acre lot. When McHarg said he'd like the sea, George thought to himself: ""Very well. We'll just drive over to the other side of the island and take a look at it.",1
5021,"So George thought the idea an excellent one and fell in with it enthusiastically, remarking that the salt air, the sound of the waves, and a good night's sleep would do them both a world of good, and would make them fit and ready for further adventures in the morning. McHarg, too, began to show whole-hearted warmth for the plan. George asked him if he had any special place in mind. He said no, that it didn't matter, that any place was good as long as it was on the sea. In rapid order they named over seacoast towns which they had either heard of or at one time or another had visited--Dover, Folkestone, Bournemouth, Eastbourne, Blackpool, Torquay, Plymouth.",1
5022,"Plymouth! Plymouth!"" cried McHarg with enthusiastic decision. That's the very place! I've been in there in ships dozens of times, but never stopped off. True, it's in the harbour, but that doesn't matter. It always looked like a nice little town. Let's go there for the night. Oh, sir,"" spoke up the chauffeur, who till now had sat quietly at his wheel, listening to two maniacs dismember the geography of the British Isles.",1
5023,"Oh, sir,"" he repeated, with an intonation of quite evident alarm, ""you can't do that, you know. Not to-night, sir. It's quite himpossible to make Plymouth to-night. What's the reason it is?",1
5024,"McHarg demanded truculently. Because, sir,"" said the driver, ""it's a good two 'undred and fifty miles, sir. In this weather, what with rain and never knowing when the fog may close in again, it would take ite all of eight hours, sir, to do it. We should not arrive there, sir, until the small hours of the morning.",1
5025,"Well, then, all right,"" McHarg cried impatiently. We'll go somewhere else. How about Blackpool? Blackpool, eh, Georgie?"" he said, turning to Webber feverishly, his lips lifting in a grimace of puckered nervousness. Let's try Blackpool. Never been there. Like to see the place. But, sir""--the driver was now obviously appalled--""Blackpool--Blackpool, sir, is in the north of England.",1
5026,"Why, sir,"" he whispered, ""Blackpool is even farther away than Plymouth is. It must be all of three 'undred miles, sir,"" he whispered, and the awe in his tone could not have been greater if they had just proposed an overnight drive from Philadelphia to the Pacific coast. We couldn't reach Blackpool, sir, before to-morrow morning. Oh, well, then,"" said McHarg in disgust.",1
5027,"Have it your own way. You name a place, George,"" he demanded. Webber thought earnestly for a long minute, then, fortified with memories of scenes from Thackeray and Dickens, he said hopefully: ""Brighton. How about Brighton?""  Instantly he knew that he had hit it.",1
5028,"The driver's voice vibrated with a tone of unspeakable relief. He turned round in his seat and whispered with almost fawning eagerness:  ""Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Brighton! We can do that very nicely, sir.""  ""How long will it take?",1
5029,"McHarg demanded. I should think, sir,"" said the driver, ""I could do it from 'ere in about two and a 'arf hours. A bit late for dinner, sir, but still, it is within reach. Good.",1
5030,"All right,"" McHarg said, nodding his head with decision and settling back in his seat. Go ahead. He waved one bony hand in a gesture of dismissal. We're going to Brighton. They started off again, and at the next cross-road charged their course to hunt for the Brighton road.",1
5031,"From that time on, their journey became a nightmare of halts and turnings and changes of direction. The little driver was sure they were headed towards Brighton, but somehow he could not find the road. They twisted this way and that, driving for miles through towns and villages, then out into the open country again, and getting nowhere. At last they came to an intricate and deserted cross-road where the driver stopped the car to look at the signs. But there was none to Brighton, and he finally admitted that he was lost. At these words, McHarg roused and pulled himself wearily forward in his seat, peered out into the dark night, then asked George what he thought they ought to do. The two of them knew even less about where they were than the driver, but they had to go somewhere. When George hazarded a guess that Brighton ought to be off to the left somewhere, McHarg commanded the man to take the first left fork and see where he came out, then sank back in his seat and closed his eyes again. At each intersection after that McHarg or Webber would tell the driver what to do, and the little Londoner would obey them dutifully, but it was evident that he harboured increasing misgivings at the thought of being lost in the wilds of Surrey and subject to the unpredictable whim of two strange Americans. For some inexplicable reason it never occurred to either of them to stop and ask their way, so they only succeeded in getting more lost than ever. They shuttled back and forth, first in one direction, then in another, and after a while George had the feeling that they must have covered a good part of the whole complex system of roads in the region south of London.",1
5032,"The driver himself was being rapidly reduced to a nervous wreck. The little man was now plainly terrified. He agreed with frenzied eagerness to everything that was said to him, but his voice trembled when he spoke. From his manner, he obviously felt that he had fallen into the clutches of two madmen, that he was now at their mercy in the lonely countryside, and that something dreadful was likely to happen at any moment. George could see him bent over the wheel, his whole figure contracted with the tenseness of his terror. If either of the crazy Americans on the back seat had chosen to let out a bloodcurdling war whoop, the wretched man would not have been surprised, but he would certainly have died instantly.",1
5033,"Under these special circumstances the very geography of the night seemed sinister and was conducive to an increase of his terror. As the hours passed, the night grew wilder. It became a stormy and demented kind of night, such as one sometimes finds in England in the winter. A man alone, if he had adventure in his soul, might have found it a thrilling and wildly beautiful night. But to this quiet little man, who was probably thinking bitterly of a glass of beer and the snug haven of his favourite pub, the demoniac visage of the night must have been appalling. It was one of those nights when the beleaguered moon drives like a spectral ship through the scudding storm rack of the sky, and the wind howls and shrieks like a demented fiend. They could hear it roaring all round them through the storm-tossed branches of the barren trees. Then it would swoop down on them with an exultant scream, and moan and whistle round the car, and sweep away again while gusts of beating rain drove across their vision. Then they would hear it howling far away--remote, demented, in the upper air, rocking the branches of the trees. And the spectral moon kept driving in and out, now casting a wild, wan radiance over the stormy landscape, now darting in behind a billowing mass of angry-looking clouds and leaving them to darkness and the fiendish howling of the wind. It was a fitting night for the commission of a crime, and the driver, it was plain to see, now feared the worst.",1
5034,"Somewhere along the road, after they had spent hours driving back and forth and getting nowhere, McHarg's amazing reserves of energy and vitality ran completely out. He was sitting sprawled out as before, with head thrown back, when suddenly he groped blindly with a hand towards George and said:  ""I'm done in, George! Stop the car! I can't go on. George stopped the car at once.",1
5035,"There by the roadside in the darkness, in stormy wind and scudding rain, they halted. In the van and fitful light of the spectral moon McHarg's appearance was ghastly. His face now looked livid and deathlike. George was greatly alarmed and suggested that he get out of the car and see if the cold air wouldn't make him feel better.",1
5036,"McHarg answered very quietly, with the utter finality of despair. No,"" he said. I just feel as if I'd like to die. Leave me alone. He slumped back into his corner, dosed his eyes, and seemed to resign himself entirely into George's keeping. He did not speak again during the remainder of that horrible journey.",1
5037,"In the half-darkness, illuminated only by the instrument panel of the car and the eerie light of the moon, George and the driver looked at each other in mute and desperate interrogation. Presently the driver moistened his dry lips and whispered:  ""What are we to do now, sir? Where shall we go?""  George thought for a moment, then answered: ""We'll have to go back to his friend's house, I think.",1
5038,"Mr. McHarg may be very ill. Turn round quickly, and let's get there as soon as possible. Yes, sir!",1
5039,"Yes, sir! the driver whispered. He backed the car round and started off again.",1
5040,"From that point on, the journey was just pure nightmare. The directions they had received were complicated and would have been hard enough to follow if they had kept to the road they had first intended to take. But now they were lost and off their course, and had somehow to find their way back to it. Through what seemed to George nothing less than a miracle, this was finally accomplished. Then their instructions required them to look carefully for several obscure cross-roads, make the proper turns at each, and at the end of all this find the lonely country lane up which McHarg's friend lived. In attempting it, they lost their way again and had to go back to a village, where the driver got his bearings and the true directions. It was after ten-thirty before they finally found the lane leading up to the house which was their destination.",1
5041,"And now the prospect was more sinister and weird than any they had seen. George could not believe that they were still in England's Surrey. He had always thought of Surrey as a pleasant and gentle place, a kind of mild and benevolent suburb of London. The name had called to his mind a vision of sweet, green fields, thick-sown with towns and villages. It was, he had thought, a place of peace and tranquil spires, as well as a kind of wonderful urbs in rure, a lovely countryside of which all parts were within an hour's run of London, a place where one could enjoy bucolic pleasures without losing any of the convenient advantages of the city, and a place where one was never out of hailing distance of his neighbour. But the region they had now come to was not at all like this. It was densely wooded, and as wild and desolate on that stormy night as any spot he had ever seen. As the car ground slowly up the tortuous road, it seemed to George that they were climbing the fiendish slope of Nightmare Hill, and he rather expected that when the moon broke from the clouds again they would find themselves in a cleared and barren circle in the forest, surrounded by the whole witches' carnival of Walpurgis Night. The wind howled through the rocking trees with insane laughter, the broken clouds scudded across the heavens like ghosts in flight, and the car lurched, bumped, groaned, and lumbered its way up a road which must have been there when the Romans came to Rye, and which, from the feel of it, had not been repaired or used since. There was not a house or a light in sight.",1
5042,"George began to feel that they were lost again, and that surely no one would choose to live in this inaccessible wilderness. He was ready to give up and was about to command the driver to turn back when, as they rounded a bend, he saw, away on the right, a hundred yards or so off the road and at some elevation above it, a house--and from its windows issued the beaconing assurance of light and warmth. 36. The House in the Country The chauffeur brought the car to a jolting halt. This must be it, sir,"" he whispered. It's the only 'ouse there is. His tone indicated heightened tension rather than relief.",1
5043,"George agreed that it was probably the place they were looking for. All the way up the hill McHarg had given no signs of life. George was seriously alarmed about him, and his anxiety had been increased the last few miles by the inanimate flappings and jerkings of the long, limp arms and bony hands of the exhausted figure every time the car hit a new bump in the road or lurched down into another rut. George spoke to him, but there was no answer. He did not want to leave him, so he suggested to the chauffeur that he'd better get out and go up to the house and find out if Mr. McHarg's friend really lived there; if so, George told him to ask the man to come down to the car.",1
5044,"This request was more than the chauffeur could bear in his already, terrified state. If before he had been frightened to be with them, he seemed now even more frightened at the thought of being without them. What he was afraid of George did not know, but he spoke as if he thought the other members of their bloody gang were in that house, just waiting for him.",1
5045,"Oh, sir,"" he whispered, ""I couldn't go up there, sir. Not to that 'ouse,"" he shuddered. Really, sir, I couldn't. I'd much rather you'd go, sir.",1
5046,"Accordingly, George got out, took a deep breath to brace himself, and started reluctantly up the path. He felt trapped in a grotesque and agonising predicament. He had no idea whom he was going to meet. He did not even know the name of McHarg's friend. McHarg had spoken of him only as Rick, which George took to be an abbreviation or a nickname. And he could not be certain that the man lived here. All he knew was that after a day filled with incredible happenings, and a nightmarish ride in a Rolls-Royce with a terrified driver, he was now advancing up a path with rain and wind beating in his face towards a house he had never seen before to tell someone whose name he did not know that one of the most distinguished of American novelists was lying exhausted at his door, and would he please come out and see if he knew him.",1
5047,"So he went on up the path and knocked at the door of what appeared to be a rambling old farm-house that had been renovated. In a moment the door opened and a man stood before him, and George knew at once that he must be, not a servant, but the master of the place. He was a well-set and well-kept Englishman of middle age. He wore a velvet jacket, in the pockets of which he kept his hands thrust while he stared out with distrust at his nocturnal visitor. He had on a wing collar and a faultless bow tie in a polka-dot pattern. This touch of formal spruceness made George feel painfully awkward and embarrassed, for he knew what a disreputable figure he himself must cut. He had not shaved for two days, and his face was covered with a coarse smudge of stubbly beard. Save for the afternoon's brief nap, he had not slept for thirty-six hours, and his eyes were red and bloodshot. His shoes were muddy, and his old hat, which was jammed down on his head, was dripping with the rain. And he was tired out, not only by physical fatigue, but by nervous strain and worry as well. It was plain that the Englishman thought him a suspicious character, for he stiffened and stood staring at him without a word.",1
5048,"You're--I----"" George began--""that is to say, if you're the one I'm looking for----""  ""Eh? the man said in a startled voice. What!""  ""It's Mr. McHarg,"" George tried again.",1
5049,"If you know him----""  ""Eh?"" he repeated, and then almost at once, ""Oh! The rising intonation of the man's tone and the faint howl of surprise and understanding that he put into the word made it sound like a startled, sharply uttered ""Owl"" He was silent a moment, searching George's face. Ow!"" he said again, and then quietly: ""Where is he?""  ""He--he's out here in his car,"" George said eagerly, feeling an overwhelming sense of relief.",1
5050,"Ow! the Englishman cried again, and then, impatiently: ""Well, then, why doesn't he come in? We've been waiting for him. I think if you'd go down and speak to him----"" George began, and paused.",1
5051,"Ow! the gentleman cried, looking at George with a solemn air. Is he--that is to say--?...Ow! he cried, as if a great light had suddenly burst upon him. Hm-m! he muttered meditatively. Well, then,"" he said in a somewhat firmer voice, stepping out into the path and closing the door carefully behind him, ""suppose we just go down and have a look at him. Shall we?""  The last squall of rain had passed as quickly as it had blown up, and the moon was sailing clear again as they started down the path together.",1
5052,"Half-way along, the Englishman stopped, looked apprehensive, and shouted to make himself heard above the wind:  ""I say--is he--I mean to say,"" he coughed, ""is he--sick?""  George knew by the emphasis on that final word, as well as from previous experience with the English, that when he said ""sick"" he meant only one thing. George shook his head. He looks very ill,"" he said, ""but he is not sick. Because,"" the gentleman went on with howling apprehensiveness, ""if he's sick--ow, dear me!",1
5053,"he exclaimed. I'm very fond of Knuck, you know--I've known him for years--but if he's going to get sick! He shuddered slightly. If you don't mind, I'd rather not. I don't want to know about it! he shouted rapidly. I--I don't want to hear about it! I--I don't want to be round when it's going on! I--I--I wash my hands of the whole business! he blurted out.",1
5054,"George reassured him that Mr. McHarg had not been sick but was merely desperately ill, so they went on down the path until they got to the car. The Englishman, after a moment's hesitation, stepped up and opened the door, thrust his head inside, and, peering down at McHarg's crumpled figure, called out:  ""Knuck! I say, Knuck!",1
5055,"McHarg was silent, save for his hoarse breathing, which was almost a snore. Knuck, old chap! the Englishman cried again. I say, Knuck! he cried more loudly. Are you there, old boy?""  McHarg very obviously was there, but he gave no answer.",1
5056,"I say, Knuck! Speak up, won't you, man? It's Rick!""  McHarg only seemed to snore more hoarsely at this announcement, but after a moment he shifted one long jack-knifed leg a few inches and, without opening his eyes, grunted: ""'Lo, Rick.",1
5057,"Then he began to snore again. I say, Knuck! the Englishman cried with sharper insistence. Won't you get up, man? We're waiting for you at the house! There was no response except the continued heavy breathing.",1
5058,"The Englishman made further efforts but nothing happened, and at length he withdrew his head out of the car and, turning to George, said:  ""I think we'd better help him inside. Knuck has worn himself out again, I fancy. Yes,"" said George anxiously.",1
5059,"He looks desperately ill, as if he were on the point of complete physical and nervous collapse. We'd better call a doctor, hadn't we?""  ""Ow, no,"" said the Englishman cheerfully. I've known Knuck a long time and seen this happen before when he got all keyed up. He drives himself mercilessly, you know--won't rest--won't stop to eat--doesn't know how to take care of himself. It would kill anybody else, the way he lives. But not Knuck. It's nothing to worry about, really. He'll be all right. You'll see. With this comforting assurance they helped McHarg out of the car and stood him on his feet.",1
5060,"His emaciated form looked pitifully weak and frail, but the cold air seemed to brace him up. He took several deep breaths and looked about him. That's fine,"" said the Englishman encouragingly. Feel better now, old chap? Feel Godawful,"" said McHarg.",1
5061,"All in. Want to go to bed. Of course,"" said the Englishman.",1
5062,"But you ought to eat first. We've kept dinner waiting. It's all ready. No food,"" said McHarg brusquely.",1
5063,"Sleep. Eat to-morrow. All right, old man,"" the Englishman said amiably.",1
5064,"Whatever you say. But your friend here must be starved. We'll fix you both up. Do come along,"" he said, and took McHarg by the arm.",1
5065,"The three of them started to move up the path together. But, sir,"" spoke a plaintive voice at George's shoulder, for he was on the side nearest the car. Full of their own concerns, they had completely forgotten the little driver. But, sir,"" he now leaned out of the window and whispered: ""what shall I do with the car, sir? Will""--he moistened his lips nervously--""will you be needing it again tonight, sir?""  The Englishman took immediate charge of the situation.",1
5066,"No,"" he said crisply, ""we shan't be needing it. Just drive it up behind the house, won't you, and leave it there. Yes, sir, yes, sir,"" the driver gasped.",1
5067,"What he was still afraid of not even he could have said. Drive it up be'ind the 'ouse, sir,"" he repeated mechanically. Very good, sir. And--and--"" again he moistened his dry lips.",1
5068,"And, ow yes! the Englishman cried, suddenly recollecting. Go into the kitchen when you're through. My butler will give you something to eat. Then, turning cheerfully and taking McHarg by the arm again, he led the way up the path, leaving the stricken driver behind to mutter: ""Yes, sir, yes, sir,"" to the demented wind and scudding moon.",1
5069,"After the blind wilderness of storm and trouble, the house, as they entered it, seemed very warm and bright with lights. It was a lovely house, low-ceilinged, panelled with old wood. Its mistress, a charming and very beautiful woman much younger than her husband, came forward to greet them. McHarg spoke a few words to his hostess and then immediately repeated his desire for sleep. The woman seemed to take in the situation at once and led the way upstairs to the guest-room, which had already been prepared for them. It was a comfortable room with deep-set windows. A fire had been kindled in the grate. There were two beds, the covers of which had been folded neatly down, the white linen showing invitingly.",1
5070,"The woman left them, and her husband and George did what they could to help McHarg get to bed. He was dead on his feet. They took off his shoes, collar, and tie, then propped him up while they got his coat and vest off. They laid him on the bed, straightened him out, and covered him. By the time all this was done and they were ready to leave the room, McHarg was lost to the world in deep and peaceful slumber.",1
5071,"The two men went downstairs again, and now for the first time remembered that in the confusion of their meeting they had not thought to introduce themselves. George told his name, and was pleased and flattered to learn that his host knew it and had even read his book. His host had the curious name of Rickenbach Reade. He informed George later in the evening that he was half-German. He had lived in England all his life, however, and in manner, speech, and appearance he was pure British.",1
5072,"Reade and Webber had been a little stiff with each other from the start. The circumstances of Webber's arrival had not been exactly conducive to easy companionship or the intimacy of quick understanding. After introductions were completed with a touch of formal constraint, Reade asked Webber if he did not want to wash up a bit, and ushered him into a small wash-room. When George emerged, freshened up as much as soap and water and comb and brush could accomplish, his host was waiting for him and, still with a trace of formality, led him into the dining-room, where the lady had preceded them. They all sat down at the table.",1
5073,"It was a lovely room, low-ceilinged, warm, panelled with old wood. The lady was lovely, too. And the dinner, although it had been standing for hours, was nevertheless magnificent. While they were waiting for the soup to come on, Reade gave George a glass of fine dry Sherry, then another, and still another. The soup came in at last, served by a fellow with a big nose and a sharp, shrewd, Cockney sort of face, correctly dressed for the occasion in clean but somewhat faded livery. It was a wonderful soup, thick tomato, the colour of dark mahogany. George could not conceal his hunger. He ate greedily, and, with the evidence of that enthusiastic appetite before them all the stiffness that was left began to melt away.",1
5074,"The butler brought in an enormous roast of beef, then boiled potatoes and Brussels sprouts. Reade carved a huge slab of meat for George, and the lady garnished his platc generously with the vegetables. They ate, too, but it was evident that they had already had their dinner. They took only small portions and left their plates unfinished, but they went through the motions just to keep George company. The beef vanished from his own plate in no time at all.",1
5075,"I say!"" cried Reade, seizing the carving knife again. Do let me give you some more. You must be starved. I should think you'd be famished,"" said his wife in a musical voice.",1
5076,"So George ate again. The butler brought in wine--old, full-toned Burgundy in a cobwebbed bottle. They polished that off. Then for dessert there was a deep and crusty apple pudding and a large slice of cheese. George ate up everything in sight. When he had finished he heaved a great sigh of satisfied appeasement and looked up. At that instant their three pairs of eyes suddenly met, and with one accord they leaned back in their chairs and roared with laughter.",1
5077,"It was the mutual and spontaneous kind of laughter that one almost never hears. It was a booming, bellowing, solid, and ungovernable ""haw-haw-haw"" that exploded out of them in a rib-splitting paroxysm and bounded and reverberated all round the walls until the very glasses on the sideboard started jingling. Once begun, it swelled and rose and mounted till it left them exhausted and aching, reduced to wheezing gasps of almost inaudible mirth, and then, when it seemed that they didn't have another gasp left in them and that their weary ribs could stand no more, it would begin again, roaring and rolling and reverberating round the room with renewed force. Twice while this was going on the butler came to the swinging-door, opened it a little, and craftily thrust his startled face round. Each time the sight of him set them off again. At length, when they were subsiding into the last faint wheezes of their fit, the butler thrust his face round the door again and said:  ""Please, sir.",1
5078,"The driver's 'ere. This wretched little man now reappeared, standing nervously in the doorway, fingering his cap, and moistening his dry lips apprehensively. Please, sir,"" he finally managed to whisper. The car. Will you be wanting it to stay be'ind the 'ouse all night, sir, or shall I take it to the nearest village? How far is the nearest village?",1
5079,"George wheezed faintly. It's about six miles, sir, I understand,"" he whispered, with a look of desperation and terror in his eyes. The expression on his face was too much for them. A strangled scream burst from Webber's throat. Mrs. Reade bent forward, thrusting her wadded napkin over her mouth. As for Rickenbach Reade, he just lay back in his chair with lolling head and roared like one possessed.",1
5080,"The driver stood there, rooted to the spot. It was clear that he thought his time had come. These maniacs had him at their mercy now, but he was too paralyzed to flee. And they could do nothing to allay his nameless fear. They could not speak to him, they could not explain, they could not even look at him. Every time they tried to say something and glanced in his direction and caught sight of the little man's blanched and absurdly tortured face, they would strangle with new whoops and yells and shrieks of helpless laughter.",1
5081,"But at last it was over. The mood was spent. They felt drained and foolish and sober and ashamed of themselves because of the needless fright they had given the little driver. So, calmly and gently, they told him to leave the car where it was and forget about it. Reade asked his butler to take care of the driver and put him up for the night in his own quarters.",1
5082,"Yes, sir, yes, sir,"" mumbled the little driver automatically. Very good, sir,"" said the butler briskly, and led the man away. They now arose from the table and went into the living-room. In a few minutes the butler brought in a tray with coffee. They sat round a cheerful fire and drank it, and had brandy afterwards. It was wonderfully warm and comforting to sit there and listen to the fury of the storm outside, and under the spell of it they felt drawn together, as if they had all known each other a long time. They laughed and talked and told stories without a trace of self-consciousness. Reade, seeing that George was still worried about McHarg, tried in various ways to allay his fears.",1
5083,"My dear fellow,"" he said, ""I've known Knuck for years. He drives himself to exhaustion and I've seen him do it a dozen times, but it always comes out all right in the end. It's astonishing how he does it. I'm sure I couldn't. No one else could, but he can. The man's vitality is amazing. Just when you think he's done himself in, he surprises you by bounding up and beginning all over again, as fresh as a daisy. George had already seen enough to know that this was true.",1
5084,"Reade told of incidents which verified it further. Some years before, McHarg had come to England to work on a new book. Even then his way of life had been enough to arouse the gravest apprehensions among those who knew him. Few people believed that he could long survive it, and his writing friends did not understand how he could get any work done.",1
5085,"We were together one night,"" Reade continued, ""at a party that he gave in a private room at the Savoy. He had been going it for days, driving himself the way he does, and by ten o'clock that night he was all in. He just seemed to cave in, and went to sleep at the table. We laid him out on a couch and went on with the party. Later on, two of us, with the assistance of a couple of porters, got him out of the place into a taxi and took him home. He had a flat in Cavendish Square. The next day,"" Reade went on, ""we had arranged to have lunch together. I had no idea--not the faintest--that the man would be able to make it. In fact, I very much doubted whether he would be out of his bed for two or three days. Just the same, I stopped in a little before one o'clock to see how he was. Reade was silent a moment, looking into the fire.",1
5086,"Then, with a sharp expiration of his breath, he said: Well! He was sitting there at his desk, in front of his typewriter,, wearing an old dressing-gown over his baggy old tweeds, and he was typing away like mad. There was a great sheaf of manuscript beside him. He told me he'd been at it since six o'clock and had done over twenty pages. As I came in, he just looked up and said: 'Hello, Rick. I'll be with you in a minute. Sit down, won't you?'... Well!""--again the sharp expiration of his breath--""I had to sit down! I simply fell into a chair and stared at him. It was the most astonishing thing I had ever seen. And was he able to go to lunch with you?""  ""Was he able!"" cried Reade.",1
5087,"Why, he fairly bounded from his chair, flung on his coat and hat, pulled me out of my seat, and said: 'Come on! I'm hungry as a bear.' And what was most astounding,"" Reade continued, ""was that he remembered everything that had happened the night before. He remembered everything that had been said, too--even the things that were said during the time when I should have sworn he was unconscious. It is an astonishing creature! Astonishing!"" cried the Englishman.",1
5088,"In the warming glow of the fire and their new-found intimacy they had several more brandies, smoked endless cigarettes, and talked on and on for hours, forgetting the passage of time. It was the kind of talk which, freed of all constricting traces of self-consciousness, lets down the last barriers of natural reserve and lays bare the souls of men. George's host was in high spirits and told the most engaging stories about himself, his wife, and the good life they were making here in the isolated freedom of their rural retreat. He made it seem not only charming and attractive, full of wholesome country pleasures, but altogether desirable and enviable. It was an idyllic picture that he painted--such a picture of rugged independence, with its simple joys and solid comforts, as has at one time or another haunted the imagination of almost every man in the turmoil, confusion, and uncertainties of the complex world we live in. But as George listened to his host and felt the nostalgic attractiveness of the images that were unfolded before him, he also felt a disquieting sense of something else behind it all which never quite got into the picture, but which lent colourings of doubt and falsity to every part of it.",1
5089,"For Rickenbach Reade, George began to see after a while, was one of those men who are unequal to the conditions of modern life, and who have accordingly retreated from the tough realities which they could not face. The phenomenon was not anew one to George. He had met and observed a number of people like this. And it was now evident to him that they formed another group or family or race, another of those little worlds which have no boundary lines of country or of place. One found a surprising number of them in America, particularly in the more sequestered purlieus of Boston, Cambridge, and Harvard University. One found them also in New York's Greenwich Village, and when even that makeshift Little Bohemia became too harsh for them, they retired into a kind of desiccated country life.",1
5090,"For all such people the country became the last refuge. They bought little farms in Connecticut or Vermont, and renovated the fine old houses with just a shade too much of whimsey or of restrained good taste. Their quaintness was a little too quaint, their simplicity a little too subtle, and on the old farms that they bought no utilitarian seeds were sown and no grain grew. They went in for flowers, and in time they learned to talk very knowingly about the rarer varieties. They loved the simple life, of course. They loved the good feel of ""the earth"". They were just a shade too conscious of ""the earth"", and George had heard them say, the women as well as the men, how much they loved to work in it.",1
5091,"And work in it they did. In spring they worked on their new rock garden, with the assistance of only one other man--some native of the region who had hired himself out for wages, and whose homely virtues and more crotchety characteristics they quietly observed and told amusing stories about to their friends. Their wives worked in the earth, too, attired in plain yet not unattractive frocks, and they even learned to clip the hedges, wearing canvas gloves to protect their hands. These dainty and lovely creatures became healthily embrowned: their comely forearms took on a golden glow, their faces became warm with soaked-up sunlight, and sometimes they even had a soft, faint down of gold just barely visible above the cheek-bone. They were good to see.",1
5092,"In winter there were also things to do. The snows came down, and the road out to the main highway became impassable to cars for three weeks at a time. Not even the trucks of the A. & P. could get through. So for three whole weeks on end they had to plod their way out on foot, a good three-quarters of a mile, to lay in provisions. The days were full of other work as well. People in cities might think that country life was dull in winter, but that was because they simply did not know. The squire became a carpenter. He was working on his play, of course, but in between times he made furniture. It was good to be able to do something with one's hands. He had a workshop fitted up in the old barn. There he had his studio, too, where he could carry on his intellectual labours undisturbed. The children were forbidden to go there. And every morning, after taking the children to school, the father could return to his barn-studio and have the whole morning free to get on with the play.",1
5093,"It was a fine life for the children, by the way. In summer they played and swam and fished and got wholesome lessons in practical democracy by mingling with the hired man's children. In winter they went to an excellent private school two miles away. It was run by two very intelligent people, an expert in planned economy and his wife, an expert in child psychology, who between them were carrying on the most remarkable experiments in education.",1
5094,"Life in the country was really full of absorbing interests which city folk knew nothing about. For one thing, there was local politics, in which they had now become passionately involved. They attended all the town meetings, became hotly partisan over the question of a new floor for the bridge across the creek, took sides against old Abner Jones, the head selectman, and in general backed up the younger, more progressive element. Over week-ends, they had the most enchanting tales to tell their ciry friends about these town meetings. They were full of stories, too, about all the natives, and could make the most sophisticated visitor howl with laughter when, after coffee and brandy in the evening, the squire and his wife would go through their two-part recital of Seth Freeman's involved squabble and lawsuit with Rob Perkins over a stone fence. One really got to know his neighbours in the country. It was a whole world in itself. Life here was simple, yet it was so good.",1
5095,"In this old farm-house they ate by candle-light at night. The pine panelling of the dining-room had been there more than two hundred years. They had not changed it. In fact, the whole front part of the house was just the same as it had always been. All they had added was the new wing for the children. Of course, they had had to do a great deal when they bought the place. It had fallen into shocking disrepair. The floors and sills were rotten and had had to be replaced. They had also built a concrete basement and installed an oil furnace. This had been costly, but it was worth the price. The people who had sold them the house were natives of the region who had gone to seed. The farm had been in that one family for five generations. It was incredible, though, to see what they had done to the house. The sitting-room had been covered with an oilcloth carpet. And in the dining-room, right beside the beautiful old revolutionary china chest, which they had persuaded the people to sell with the house, had been an atrocious gramophone with one of those old-fashioned horns. Could one imagine that?",1
5096,"Of course they had had to furnish the house anew from cellar to garret. Their city stuff just wouldn't do at all. It had taken time and hard work, but by going quietly about the countryside and looking into farmers' houses, they had managed to pick up very cheaply the most exquisite pieces, most of them dating back to revolutionary times, and now the whole place was in harmony at last. They even drank their beer from pewter mugs. Grace had discovered these, covered with cobwebs, in the cellar of an old man's house. He was eighty-seven, he said, and the mugs had belonged to his father before him. He'd never had no use for 'em himself, and if she wanted 'em he calc'lated that twenty cents apiece would be all right. Wasn't it delicious! And everyone agreed it was.",1
5097,"The seasons changed and melted into one another, and they observed the seasons. They would not like to live in places where no seasons were. The adventure of the seasons was always thrilling. There was the day in late summer when someone saw the first duck flying south, and they knew by this token that the autumn of the year had come. Then there was the first snowflake that melted as it fell to usher in the winter. But the most exciting of all was the day in early spring when someone discovered that the first snowdrop had opened or that the first starling had come. They kept a diary of the seasons, and they wrote splendid letters to their city friends:  ""I think you would like it now.",1
5098,"The whole place is simply frantic, with spring. I heard a thrush for the first time to-day. Overnight almost, our old apple-trees have burst into full bloom. If you wait another week, it will be too late. So do come, won't you? You'll love our orchard and our twisted, funny, dear old apple-trees. They've been here, most of them, I suspect, for eighty years. It's not like modern orchards, with their little regiments of trees. We don't get many apples. They are small and sharp and tart, and twisted like the trees themselves, and there are never too many of them but always just enough. Somehow we love them all the better for it. It's so New England. So year followed year in healthy and happy order.",1
5099,"The first year the rock garden got laid down and the little bulbs and alpine plants set out. Hollyhocks were sown all over the place, against the house and beside the fences. By the next year they were blooming in gay profusion. It was marvellous how short a time it took. That second year he built the studio in the barn, doing most of the work with his own hands, with only the simple assistance of the hired man. The third year--the children were growing up now; they grow fast in the country--he got the swimming-pool begun. The fourth year it was finished. Meanwhile he was busy on his play, but it went slowly because there was so much else that had to be done.",1
5100,"The fifth year--well, one did miss the city sometimes. They would never think of going back there to This place was wonderful, except for three months in the winter. So this year they were moving in and taking an apartment for the three bad months. Grace, of course, loved music and missed the opera, while he liked the theatre, and it would be good to have again the companionship of certain people whom they knew. That was the greatest handicap of country life--the natives made fine neighbours, but one sometimes missed the intellectual stimulus of city life. And so this year he had decided to take the old girl in. They'd see the shows and hear the music andrenew their acquaintance with old friends and find out what was going on. They might even run down to Bermuda for three weeks in February. Or to Haiti. That was a place, he'd heard, that modern life had hardly touched. They had windmills and went in for voodoo worship. It was all savage and most primitively colourful. It would get them out of the rut to go off somewhere on a trip. Of course they'd be back in the country by the first of April.",1
5101,"Such was the fugitive pattern in one of its most common manifestations. But it also took other forms. The American expatriates who had taken up residence in Europe were essentially the same kind of people, though theirs was a more desolate and more embittered type of escapism. George Webber had known them in Paris, in Switzerland, and here in England, and it seemed to him that they represented one of the extremest breeds among the race of futilitarians. These were the Americans who had gone beyond even the pretence of being nature-lovers and earth-discoverers and returners to the simple life of native virtue in rural Yankeedom. These were the ones to whom nothing was left except an encyclopedic sneer--a sneer at everything American. It was a sneer which was derived from what they had read, from what others had said, or from some easy rationalization of self-defence. It was a sneer that did not have in it the sincerity of passion or the honesty of true indignation, and it became feebler year after year. For these people had nothing left but drink and sneering, the dreary round of cafe life with its repetition of racked saucers--nothing left but a blurred vision of the world, a sentimental fantasy of ""Paris"", or of ""England"", or of ""Europe"", which was as unreal as if all their knowledge had been drawn from the pages of a fairy-tale, and as if they had never set foot upon these shores which they professed to understand so well and to cherish so devotedly.",1
5102,"And always with this race of men it seemed to George that the fundamental inner structure Of illusion and defeat was the same, whether they followed the more innocuous formula of flight to the farm, with its trumped-up interest in rock gardening, carpentry, hollyhock culture, and the rest of it, or whether they took the more embittered route of retreat to Europe and the racked saucers. And it made no difference whether they were Americans, Englishmen, Germans, or Hottentots. All of them betrayed themselves by the same weaknesses. They fled a world they were not strong enough to meet. If they had talent, it was a talent that was not great enough to win for them the fulfilment and success which they pretended to scorn, but for which each of them would have sold the pitifully small remnant of his meagre soul. If they wanted to create, they did not want it hard enough to make and shape and finish something in spite of hell and heartbreak. If they wanted to work, they did not want it genuinely enough to work and keep on working till their eyeballs ached and their brains were dizzy, to work until their loins were dry, their vitals hollow, to work until the whole world reeled before them in a grey blur of weariness and depleted energy, to work until their tongues clove to their mouths and their pulses hammered like dry mallets at their temples, to work until no work was left in them, until there was no rest and no repose, until they could not sleep, until they could do nothing and could work no more--and then work again. They were the pallid half-men of the arts, more desolate and damned than if they had been born with no talent at all, more lacking in their lack, possessing half, than if their lack had been complete. And so, half full of purpose, they eventually fled the task they were not equal to--and they pottered, tinkered, gardened, carpentered, and drank.",1
5103,"Such a man, in his own way, was this Englishman, Rickenbach Reade. He was, as he confided to George later in the evening, a writer--as he himself put it, with a touch of bitter whimsey, ""a writer of sorts"". He had had a dozen books published. He took them from their shelves with a curious eagerness that was half apology and showed them to George. They were critical biographies of literary men and politicians, and were examples of the ""debunking school"" of historical writing. George later read one or two of them, and they turned out to be more or less what he had expected. They were the kind of books that debunked everything except themselves. They were the lifeless products of a padded Stracheyism: their author, lacking Strachey's wit and shirking the labours of his scholarship, succeeded at best in a feeble mimicry of his dead vitality, his moribund fatigue, his essential foppishness. So these books, dealing with a dozen different lives and periods, were really all alike, all the same--the manifestations of defeat, the jabs of an illusioned disillusion, the sceptical evocations of a fantastic and unliving disbelief.",1
5104,"Their author, being the kind of man he was, could not write otherwise than as he had written. Having no belief or bottom in himself, he found no belief or bottom in the lives he wrote about. Everything was bunk, every great man who ever lived had been built up into the image of greatness by a legend of concocted bunk; truth, therefore, lay in the debunking process, since all else was bunk, and even truth itself was bunk. He was one of those men who, by the nature of their characters and their own defeat, could believe only the worst of others. If he had written about Caesar, he could never have convinced himself that Caesar looked--as Caesar looked; he would assuredly have found evidence to show that Caesar was a miserable dwarf, the butt of ridicule among his own troops. If he had written about Napoleon, he would have seen him only as a fat and pudgy little man who got his forelock in the soup and had grease spots on the lapels of his marshal's uniform. If he had written about George Washington, he would have devoted his chief attention to Washington's false teeth, and would have become so deeply involved with them that he would have forgotten all about George Washington. If he had written about Abraham Lincoln, he would have seen him as a deified Uriah Heep, the grotesque product of backwoods legendry, a country lawyer come to town, his very fame a thing of chance, the result of a fortuitous victory and a timely martyrdom. He could never have believed that Lincoln really said the things that Lincoln said, or that he really wrote what he is known to have written. Why? Because the things said and written were too much like Lincoln. They were too good to be true. Therefore they were myths. They had not been said at all. Or, if they had been said, then somebody else had said them. Stanton had said them, or Seward had said them, or a newspaper reporter had said them--anybody could have said them except Lincoln.",1
5105,"Such was the tone and temper of Reade's books, and such was the quality of disbelief that had produced them. In consequence, they fooled no one except the author. They did not even have the energy of an amusing or persuasive slander. They were stillborn the moment they issued from the press. No one read them or paid any attention to them.",1
5106,"And how did he rationalise to himself his defeat and failure? In the easy, obvious, and inevitable way. He had been rash enough, he told George with a smile of faint, ironic bitterness, to expose some of the cherished figures of public worship and, with his cold, relentless probing for the truth, to shatter the false legends that surrounded them. Naturally, his reward had been anathema and abuse, the hatred of the critics and the obstinate hostility of the public. It had been a thankless business from beginning to end, so he was done with it. He had turned his back on the prejudice, bigotry, stupidity, and hypocrisy of the whole fickle and idolatrous world, and had come here to the country to find solitude and seclusion. One gathered that he would write no more.",1
5107,"And this life certainly had its compensations. The old house which Reade had bought and renovated, making it a trifle too faultlessly agricultural, with a work-bench for mending harness in the kitchen, was nevertheless a charming place. His young wife was gracious and lovely, and obviously cared a great deal for him. And Reade himself, apart from the literary pretensions which had embittered his life, was not a bad sort of man. When one understood and accepted the nature of his illusions and defeat, one saw that he was a likable and good-hearted fellow.",1
5108,"It was growing late, but they had not noticed and were surprised when the clock in the hall chimed two. The three of them talked quietly for a few minutes after that, had a final glass of brandy, then said good night. George went upstairs, and shortly afterwards he heard Mr. and Mrs. Reade come softly up and go to their room.",1
5109,"McHarg lay motionless, just as they had left him. He had not stirred a muscle, but seemed to be sunk in the untroubled sleep of childhood. George spread another blanket over him. Then he undressed, turned out the lights, and crawled into his own bed.",1
5110,"He was exhausted, but so excited by all the strange events of the day that he was beyond the desire for sleep. He lay there thinking over what had happened and listening to the wind. It would rush at the house and shiver the windows, then swoop round the corners and the eaves, howling like a banshee. Somewhere a shutter flapped and banged insanely. Now and then, in the momentary lulls between the rushes of the wind, a dog barked mournfully in the faint distance. He heard the clock in the downstairs hall chime three.",1
5111,"It was some time after that when he finally dropped off. The storm was still howling like a madman round the house, but he was no longer aware of it. 37. The Morning After George lay in merciful and dreamless sleep, as leaden as if he had GEORGE knocked senseless by a heavy club. How long he had slept he did not know, but it hardly seemed five minutes when he was awakened suddenly by someone shaking him by the shoulder. He opened his eyes and started up. It was McHarg. He stood there in his underwear, prancing round on his stork-like legs like an impatient sprinter straining at the mark.",1
5112,"Get up George, get up! he cried shrilly. For Christ's sake, man, are you going to sleep all day? George stared at him dumbfounded.",1
5113,"What--what time is it? he managed finally to say. It's after eight o'clock,"" McHarg cried. I've been up an hour. Shaved and had a bath, and now,"" he smacked his bony hands together with an air of relish and sniffed zestfully at the breakfast-laden air, ""boy, I could eat a horse! Don't you smell it? he cried gleefully. Oatmeal, eggs and bacon, grilled tomatoes, toast and marmalade, coffee. Ali! he sighed with reverent enthusiasm. There's nothing like an English breakfast. Get up, George, get up! he cried again with shrill insistence. My God, man, I let you sleep a whole hour longer than I did because you looked as if you needed it! So get your clothes on! We don't want to keep breakfast waiting!""  George groaned, dragged his legs wearily from the covers, and stood groggily erect.",1
5114,"He felt as if he wanted nothing so much as to sleep for two days on end. But under the feverish urging of this red fury, he had nothing left to do except to awake and dress. Like a man in a trance, he pulled on his clothes with slow, fumbling motions, and all the while McHarg fumed up and down, demanding every two seconds that he get a move on and not be all day about it.",1
5115,"When they got downstairs the Reades were already at the table. McHarg bounced in as if he had a rubber core, greeted both of them cheerfully, took a seat, and instantly fell to. He put away an enormous breakfast, talking all the time and crackling with electricity. His energy was astounding. It was really incredible. It seemed impossible that the exhausted wreck of a few hours before could now be miraculously transformed into this dynamo of vitality. He was in uproarious spirits, and full of stories and adventures. He told wonderful yarns about the ceremonies at which his degree had been presented and about all the people there. Then he told about Berlin, and about people he had met in Germany and in Holland. He told of his meeting with Mynheer Bendien, and gave a side-splitting account of their madhouse escapades. He was full of plans and purposes. He asked about everyone he knew in England. His mind seemed to have a thousand brilliant facets. He took hold of everything, and whatever he touched began to crackle with the energy and alertness of his own dynamic power. He was a delightful companion. George realised that he was now seeing McHarg at his best, and his best was wonderfully and magnificently good.",1
5116,"After breakfast they all took a walk together. It was a rare, wild morning. The temperature had dropped several degrees during the night and the fitful rain had turned to snow, which was now coming down steadily, swirling and gusting through the air upon the howling wind and piling up in soft, fleecy drifts. Overhead, the branches of the bare trees thrashed about and moaned. The countryside was impossibly wild and beautiful. They walked long and far, filled with the excitement of the storm, and with a strange, wild joy and sorrow, knowing that the magic could not last.",1
5117,"When they came back to the house, they sat beside the fire and talked together. McHarg's gleeful exuberance of the morning had subsided, but in its place had come a quiet power--the kind of Lincolnesque dignity of repose and strength which George had observed in him the day before. He took out his old silver-rimmed spectacles and put them on his homely, wry, and curiously engaging face. He read some letters which he had in his pocket and had not opened, and after that he talked to his old friend. What they talked about was not important in itself. What was important, and what George would always remember, was the way McHarg looked, and the way he sat and talked, with his bony knuckles arched and clasped before him in an attitude of unconscious power, and the dignity, wisdom, and deep knowledge of his speech. Here was a man with greatness in him, a man who was now showing the basic sources of his latent strength. His speech was full of quiet affection for his old friend. One felt something unshakable and abiding in him--a loyalty that would not change, that would remain always the same, even though he might not see his friend again for twenty years.",1
5118,"They had a good lunch together. Wine was served, but McHarg partook sparingly of it. After lunch, to Webber's great relief, McHarg told him quietly that they were returning to London in the afternoon. He said nothing about the projected tour of England which he had depicted in such glowing colours the day before. Whether that had been just a passing whim, or whether he had given up the idea because he sensed George's lack of enthusiasm for it, George did not know. McHarg did not refer to it at all. He merely announced their return to London as a fact and let it go at that.",1
5119,"But now, as if the thought of going back to the city was more than he could bear, he immediately underwent another of his astonishing transformations. Almost at once his manner again became feverish and impatient. By three o'clock, when they left, he had worked himself into a state of inflamed distemper. He seemed on edge, like one who wanted to get some disagreeable business over and done with.",1
5120,"They drove cautiously down the whitened, trackless lane, over which no car had passed that day, leaving behind them the low-eaved comfort of that fine old house, now warmly fleeced in its blanket of snow, and George felt again the almost unbearable sadness that always came to him when he said good-bye to people whom he knew he would never see again. The lovely woman stood in the doorway and watched them go, with Reade beside her, his hands thrust deep in the pockets of his velvet jacket. As the car took the turn McHarg and George looked back. Reade and his wife waved, and they waved back, and something tightened in George's throat. Then they were out of sight. McHarg and George were alone again.",1
5121,"They reached the high road and turned north and sped onward towards London. Both men were silent, each absorbed in his own thoughts. McHarg sat back in his corner, quiet, abstracted, sunk deep into his inner world. Darkness came, and they said nothing.",1
5122,"And now the lights were up, and there against the sky George saw again the vast corrupted radiance of the night--the smoke, the fury, and the welter of London's unending life. And after a little while the car was threading its way through the jungle warren of that monstrous sprawl, and at last it turned into Ebury Street and stopped. George got out and thanked McHarg; they shook hands, exchanged a few words, and then said good-bye. The little driver shut the door, touched his cap respectfully, and climbed back into his seat. The big car purred and drove off smoothly into the darkness.",1
5123,"George stood at the kerb and looked after it until it disappeared. And he knew that he and McHarg might meet and speak and pass again, but never as they had in this, their first meeting; for something had begun which now was finished, and henceforth they would have to take their separate courses, he to his own ending, McHarg to his--and which to the better one no man knew. BOOK VI. - ""I HAVE A THING TO TELL YOU"" (""Nun Will Ich Ihnen 'Was Sagen"") By spring, when George returned to New York, it seemed to him that he had his new book almost finished. He took a small apartment near Stuyvesant Square and buckled down to a steady daily grind to wind it up. He thought two months more would surely see him through, but he always fooled himself about time, and it was not till six months later that he had a manuscript that satisfied him. That is to say, he had a manuscript that he was willing to turn over to his publisher, for he was never really satisfied with anything he wrote. There was always that seemingly unbridgeable gulf between the thing imagined and the thing accomplished, and he wondered if any writer had ever been able to look calmly at something he had done and honestly say:  ""This conveys precisely the ideas and feelings I wanted it to convey--no more, no less.",1
5124,"The thing is just right, and cannot be improved. In that sense he was not at all satisfied with his new book. He knew its faults, knew all the places where it fell short of his intentions. But he' also knew that he had put into it everything he had at that stage of his development, and for this reason he was not ashamed of it. He delivered the bulky manuscript to Fox Edwards, and as its weight passed from his hands to Fox's he felt as if a load that he had been carrying for years had been lifted from his mind and conscience. He was done with it, and he wished to God he could forget it and never have to see a line of it again.",1
5125,"That, however, was too much to hope for. Fox read it, told him in his shy, straight way that it was good, and then made a few suggestions--for cutting it here, for adding something there, for rearranging some of the material. George argued hotly with Fox, then took the manuscript home and went to work on it again and did the things Fox wanted--not because Fox wanted them, but because he saw that Fox was right. Two more months went into that. Then there were proofs to read and correct, and by the time this was done another six weeks had gone. The better part of a year had passed since his return from England, but now the job was really finished and he was free at last.",1
5126,"Publication was scheduled for the spring of 1936, and as the time approached he became increasingly apprehensive. When his first book had come out, wild horses could not have dragged him from New York; he had wanted to be on hand so he could be sure not to miss anything. He had waited around, and read all the reviews, and almost camped out in Fox's office, and had expected from day to day some impossible fulfilment that never came. Instead, there had been the letters from Libya Hill and his sickening adventures with the lion hunters. So now he was gun-shy of publication dates, and he made up his mind to go away this time--as far as possible away. Although he did not believe there would be an exact repetition of those earlier experiences, just the same he was prepared for the worst, and when it happened he was determined not to be there.",1
5127,"Suddenly he thought of Germany, and thought of it with intense longing. Of all the countries he had ever seen, that was the one, after America, which he like the best, and in which he felt most at home, and with whose people he had the most natural, instant, and instinctive sympathy and understanding. It was also the country above all others whose mystery and magic haunted him. He had been there several times, and each time its spell over him had been the same. And now, after the years of labour and exhaustion, the very thought of Germany meant peace to his soul, and release, and happiness, and the old magic again.",1
5128,"So in March, two weeks before the publication of his book, with Fox at the pier to see him off and reassure him that everything was going to be all right, he sailed again for Europe. 38. The Dark Messiah George had not been in Germany since 1928 and the early months of 1929, when he had had to spend weeks of slow convalescence in a Munich hospital after a fight in a beer hall. Before that foolish episode, he had stayed for a while in a little town in the Black Forest, and he remembered that there had been great excitement because an election was being held. The state of politics was chaotic, with a bewildering number of parties, and the Communists polled a surprisingly large vote. People were disturbed and anxious, and there seemed to be a sense of impending calamity in the air.",1
5129,"This time, things were different. Germany had changed. Ever since 1933, when the change occurred, George had read, first with amazement, shock, and doubt, then with despair and a leaden sinking of the heart, all the newspaper accounts of what was going on in Germany. He found it hard to believe some of the reports. Of course, there were irresponsible extremists in Germany as elsewhere, and in times of crisis no doubt they got out of hand, but he thought he knew Germany and the German people, and on the whole he was inclined to feel that the true state of affairs had been exaggerated and that things simply could not be as bad as they were pictured.",1
5130,"And now, on the train from Paris, where he had stopped off for five weeks, he met some Germans who gave him reassurance. They said there was no longer any confusion or chaos in politics and government, and no longer any fear among the people, because everyone was so happy. This was what George wanted desperately to believe, and he was prepared to be happy, too. For no man ever went to a foreign land under more propitious conditions than those which attended his arrival in Germany early in May, 1936.",1
5131,"It is said that Byron awoke one morning at the age of twenty-four to find himself famous. George Webber had to wait eleven years longer. He was thirty-five when he reached Berlin, but it was magic just the same. Perhaps he was not really very famous, but that didn't matter, because for the first and last time in his life he felt as if he were. Just before he left Paris a letter had reached him from Fox Edwards, telling him that his new book was having a great success in America. Then, too, his first book had been translated and published in Germany the year before. The German critics had said tremendous things about it, it had had a very good sale, and his name was known. When he got to Berlin the people were waiting for him.",1
5132,"The month of May is wonderful everywhere. It was particularly wonderful in Berlin that year. Along the streets, in the Tiergarten, in all the great gardens, and along the Spree Canal the horse-chestnut trees were in full bloom. The crowds sauntered underneath the trees on the Kurfürstendamm, the terraces of the cafés were jammed with people, and always, through the golden sparkle of the days, there was a sound of music in the air. George saw the chains of endlessly lovely lakes around Berlin, and for the first time he knew the wonderful golden bronze upon the tall poles of the kiefern-trees. Before, he had visited only the south of Germany, the Rhinelands and Bavaria; now the north seemed even more enchanting.",1
5133,"He planned to stay all summer, and one summer seemed too short a time to encompass all the beauty, magic, and almost intolerable joy which his life had suddenly become, and which he felt would never fade or tarnish if only he could remain in Germany for ever. For, to cap it all, his second book was translated and brought out within a short time of his arrival, and its reception exceeded anything he had ever dared to hope for. Perhaps his being there at the time may have had something to do with it. The German critics outdid each other in singing his praises. If one called him ""the great American epic writer"", the next seemed to feel he had to improve on that, and called hiti ""the American Homer"". So now everywhere he went there were people who knew his work. His name flashed and shone. He was a famous man.",1
5134,"Fame shed a portion of her loveliness on everything about him. Life took on an added radiance. The look, feel, taste, smell, and sound of everything had gained a tremendous and exciting enhancement, and all because Fame was at his side. He saw the world with a sharper relish of perception than he had ever known before. All the confusion, fatigue, dark doubt, and bitter hopelessness that had afflicted him in times past had gone, and no shadow of any kind remained. It seemed to him that he had won a final and utterly triumphant victory over all the million forms of life. His spirit was no longer tormented, exhausted, and weighted down with the ceaseless effort of his former struggles with Amount and Number. He was wonderfully aware of everything, alive in every pore.",1
5135,"Fame even gave a tongue to silence, a language to unuttered speech. Fame was with him almost all the time, but even when he was alone without her, in places where he was not known and his name meant nothing, the aura which Fame had shed still clung to him and he was able to meet each new situation with a sense of power and confidence, of warmth, friendliness, and good fellowship. He had become the lord of life. There had been a time in his youth when be felt that people were always laughing at him, and he had been ill at ease with strangers and had gone to every new encounter with a chip on his shoulder. But now he was life's strong and light-hearted master, and everyone he met and talked to--writers, taxi-drivers, porters in hotels, elevator boys, casual acquaintances in trams and trains and on the street--felt at once the flood of happy and affectionate power within him, and responded to him eagerly, instinctively, with instant natural liking, as men respond to the clean and shining light of the young sun.",1
5136,"And when Fame was with him, all this magic was increased. He could see the wonder, interest, respect, and friendly envy in the eyes of men, and the frank adoration in the eyes of women. The women seemed to worship at the shrine of Fame. George began to get letters and telephone calls from them, with invitations to functions of every sort. The girls were after him. But he had been through all of that before and he was wary now, for he knew that the lion hunters were the same the whole world over. Knowing them now for what they were, he found no disillusion in his encounters with them. Indeed, it added greatly to his pleasure and sense of power to turn the tactics of designing females on themselves: he would indulge in little gallantries to lead them on, and then, just at the point where they thought they had him, he would wriggle innocently off the hook and leave them wondering.",1
5137,"And then he met Else. Else von Kohler was not a lion hunter. George met her at one of the parties which his German publisher, Karl Lewald, gave for him. Lewald liked to give parties; he just couldn't do enough for George, and was always trumping up an excuse for another party. Else did not know Lewald, and took an instinctive dislike to the man as soon as she saw him, but just the same she had come to his party, brought there uninvited by another man whom George had met. At first sight, George fell instantly in love with her, and she with him.",1
5138,"Else was a young widow of thirty who looked and was a perfect type of the Norse Valkyrie. She had a mass of lustrous yellow hair braided about her head, and her cheeks were two ruddy apples. She was extremely tall for a woman, with the long, rangy legs of a runner, and her shoulders were as broad and wide as a man's. Yet she had a stunning figure, and there was no suggestion of an ugly masculinity about her. She was as completely and as passionately feminine as a woman could be. Her somewhat stern and lonely face was relieved by its spiritual depth and feeling, and when it was lighted by a smile it had a sudden, poignant radiance, a quality of illumination which in its intensity and purity was different from any other smile George had ever seen.",1
5139,"At the moment of their first meeting, George and Else had been drawn to each other. From then on, without the need of any period of transition, their lives flowed in a single channel. They spent many wonderful days together. Many too, were the nights which they filled with the mysterious enchantments of a strong and mutually shared passion. The girl became for George the ultimate reality underlying everything he thought and felt and was during that glorious and intoxicating period of his life.",1
5140,"And now all the blind and furious Brooklyn years, all the years of work, all the memories of men who prowled in garbage cans, all the years of wandering and exile, seemed very far away. In some strange fashion, the image of his own success and this joyous release after so much toil and desperation became connected in George's mind with Else, with the kiefern-trees, with the great crowds thronging the Kurfürstendamm, with all the golden singing in the air--and somehow with a feeling that for everyone grim weather was behind and that happy days were here again. It was the season of the great Olympic games, and almost every day George and Else went to the stadium in Berlin. George observed that the organising genius of the German people, which has been used so often to such noble purpose, was now more thrillingly displayed than he had ever seen it before. The sheer pageantry of the occasion was overwhelming, so much so that he began to feel oppressed by it. There seemed to be something ominous in it. One sensed a stupendous concentration of effort, a tremendous drawing together and ordering in the vast collective power of the whole land. And the thing that made it seem ominous was that it so evidently went beyond what the games themselves demanded. The games were overshadowed, and were no longer merely sporting competitions to which other nations had sent their chosen teams. They became, day after day, an orderly and overwhelming demonstration in which the whole of Germany had been schooled and disciplined. It was as if the games had been chosen as a symbol of the new collective might, a means of showing to the world in concrete terms what this new power had come to be.",1
5141,"With no past experience in such affairs, the Germans had constructed a mighty stadium which was the most beautiful and most perfect in its design that had ever been built. And all the accessories of this monstrous plant--the swimming pools, the enormous halls, the lesser stadia--had been laid out and designed with this same cohesion of beauty and of use. The organisation was superb. Not only were the events themselves, down to the minutest detail of each competition, staged and run off like clockwork, but the crowds--such crowds as no other great city has ever had to cope with, and the like of which would certainly have snarled and maddened the traffic of New York beyond hope of untangling--were handled with a quietness, order, and speed that was astounding.",1
5142,"The daily spectacle was breath-taking in its beauty and magnificence. The stadium was a tournament of colour that caught the throat; the massed splendour of the banners made the gaudy decorations of America's great parades, presidential inaugurations, and World's Fairs seem like shoddy carnivals in comparison. And for the duration of the Olympics, Berlin itself was transformed into a kind of annex to the stadium. From one end of the city to the other, from the Lustgarten to the Brandenburger Tor, along the whole broad sweep of Unter den Linden, through the vast avenues of the faery Tiergarten, and out through the western part of Berlin to the very portals of the stadium, the whole town was a thrilling pageantry of royal banners--not merely endless miles of looped-up bunting, but banners fifty feet in height, such as might have graced the battle tent of some great emperor.",1
5143,"And all through the day, from morning on, Berlin became a mighty Ear, attuned, attentive, focused on the stadium. Everywhere the air was filled with a single voice. The green trees along the Kurfürstendamm began to talk: from loud-speakers concealed in their branches an announcer in the stadium spoke to the whole city--and for George Webber it was a strange experience to hear the familiar terms of track and field translated into the tongue that Goethe used. He would be informed now that the Vorlauf was about to be run--and then the Zwischenlauf--and at length the Endlauf--and the winner:  ""Owens--Oo Ess Ah!""  Meanwhile, through those tremendous banner-laden ways, the crowds thronged ceaselessly all day long.",1
5144,"The wide promenade of Unter den Linden was solid with patient, tramping German feet. Fathers, mothers, children, young folks, old--the whole material of the nation was there, from every corner of the land. From morn to night they trudged, wide-eyed, full of wonder, past the marvel of those banner-laden ways. And among them one saw the bright stabs of colour of Olympic jackets and the glint of foreign faces: the dark features of Frenchmen and Italians, the ivory grimace of the Japanese, the straw hair and blue eyes of the Swedes, and the big Americans, natty in straw hats, white flannels, and blue coats crested with the Olympic seal.",1
5145,"And there were great displays of marching men, sometimes ungunned but rhythmic as regiments of brown shirts went swinging through the streets. By noon each day all the main approaches to the games, the embannered streets and avenues of the route which the Leader would take to the stadium, miles away, were walled in by the troops. They stood at ease, young men, laughing and talking with each other--the Leader's bodyguards, the Schutz Staffel units, the Storm Troopers, all the ranks and divisions in their different uniforms--and they stretched in two unbroken lines from the Wilhelm-strasse up to the arches of the Brandenburger Tor. Then, suddenly, the sharp command, and instantly there would be the solid smack of ten thousand leather boots as they came together with the sound of war.",1
5146,"It seemed as if everything had been planned for this moment, shaped to this triumphant purpose. But the people--they had not been planned. Day after day, behind the unbroken wall of soldiers, they stood and waited in a dense and patient throng. These were the masses of the nation, the poor ones of the earth, the humble ones of life, the workers and the wives, the mothers and the children--and day after day they came and stood and waited. They were there sa because they did not have money enough to buy the little cardboard squares that would have given them places within the magic ring. From noon till night they waited for just two brief and golden moments of the day: the moment when the Leader went out to the stadium, and the moment when he returned.",1
5147,"At last he came--and something like a wind across a field of grass was shaken through that crowd, and from afar the tide rolled up with him, and in it was the voice, the hope, the prayer of the land. The Leader came by slowly in a shining car, a little dark man with a comic-opera moustache, erect and standing, moveless and unsmiling, with his hand upraised, palm outward, not in Nazi-wise salute, but straight up, in a gesture of blessing such as the Buddha or Messiahs use. From the beginning of their relationship, and straight through to the end, Else refused to discuss with George anything even remotely connected with the Nazi regime. That was a closed subject between them. But others were not so discreet. The first weeks passed, and George began to hear some ugly things. From time to time, at parties, dinners, and the like, when George would speak of his enthusiasm for Germany and the German people, various friends that he had made would, if they had had enough to drink, take him aside afterwards and, after looking round cautiously, lean towards him with an air of great secrecy and whisper:  ""But have you heard...?",1
5148,"And have you heard...? He did not see any of the ugly things they whispered about. He did not see anyone beaten. He did not see anyone imprisoned, or put to death. He did not see any men in concentration camps. He did not see openly anywhere the physical manifestations of a brutal and compulsive force.",1
5149,"True, there were men in brown uniforms everywhere, and men in black uniforms, and men in uniforms of olive green, and everywhere in the streets there was the solid smack of booted feet, the blare of brass, the tootling of fifes, and the poignant sight of young faces shaded under iron helmets, with folded arms and ramrod backs, precisely seated in great army lorries. But all of this had become so mixed in with his joy over his own success, his feeling for Else, and the genial temper of the people making holiday, as he had seen and known it so many pleasant times before, that even if it did not now seem good, it did not seem sinister or bad. Then something happened. It didn't happen suddenly. It just happened as a cloud gathers, as fog settles, as rain begins to fall.",1
5150,"A man George had met was planning to give a party for him and asked him it he wanted to ask any of his friends. George mentioned one. His host was silent for a moment; he looked embarrassed; then he said that the person George had named had formerly been the editorial head of a publication that had been suppressed, and that one of the people who had been instrumental in its suppression had been invited to the party, so would George mind--?",1
5151,"George named another, an old friend named Franz Heilig whom he had first met in Munich years before, and who now lived in Berlin, and of whom he was very fond. Again the anxious pause, the embarrassment, the halting objections. This person was--waswell, George's host said he knew about this person and knew he did not go to parties--he would not come if he were invited--so would George mind----?  George next spoke the name of Else von Kohler, and the response to this suggestion was of the same kind.",1
5152,"How long had he known this woman? Where, and under what circumstances, had he met her? George tried to reassure his host on all these scores. He told the man he need have no fear of any sort about Else. His host was instant, swift, in his apologies: oh, by no means--he was sure the lady was eminently all right--only, nowadays--with a mixed gathering--he had tried to pick a group of people whom George had met and who all knew one another--he had thought it would be much more pleasant that way--strangers at a party were often shy, constrained, and formal--Frau von Kohler would not know anybody there--so would George mind----?  Not long after this baffling experience a friend came to see him.",1
5153,"In a few days,"" his friend said, ""you will receive a phone call from a certain person. He will try to meet you, to talk to you. Have nothing to do with this man. George laughed.",1
5154,"His friend was a sober-minded German, rather on the dull and heavy side, and his face was so absurdly serious as he spoke that George thought he was trying to play some lumbering joke upon him. He wanted to know who this mysterious personage might be who was so anxious to make his acquaintance. To George's amazement and incredulity, his friend named a high official in the government.",1
5155,"But why, George asked, should this man want to meet him? And why, if he did, should he be afraid of him? At first his friend would not answer. Finally he muttered circumspectly:  ""Listen to me.",1
5156,"Stay away from this man. I tell you for your own good. He paused, not knowing how to say it; then: ""You have heard of Captain Roehm? You know about him? You know what happened to him? George nodded. Well,"" his friend went on in a troubled voice, ""there were others who were not shot in the purge. This man I speak of is one of the bad ones. We have a name for him--it is 'The Prince of Darkness'. George did not know what to make of all this.",1
5157,"He tried to puzzle it out but could not, so at last he dismissed it from his mind. But within a few days the official whom his friend had named did telephone, and did ask to meet him. George offered some excuse and avoided seeing the man, but the episode was most peculiar and unsettling.",1
5158,"Both of these baffling experiences contained elements of comedy and melodrama, but those were the superficial aspects. George began to realise now the tragedy that lay behind such things. There was nothing political in any of it. The roots of it were much more sinister and deep and evil than politics or even racial prejudice could ever be. For the first time in his life he had come upon something full of horror that he had never known before--something that made all the swift violence and passion of America, the gangster compacts, the sudden killings, the harshness and corruption that infested portions of American business and public life, seem innocent beside it. What George began to see was a picture of a great people who had been psychically wounded and were now desperately ill with some dread malady of the soul. Here was an entire nation, he now realised, that was infested with the contagion of an ever-present fear. It was a kind of creeping paralysis which twisted and blighted all human relations. The pressures of a constant and infamous compulsion had silenced this whole people into a sweltering and malignant secrecy until they had become spiritually septic with the distillations of their own self-poisons, for which now there was no medicine or release.",1
5159,"As he began to see and understand the true state of affairs, George wondered if anyone could be so base as to exult at this great tragedy, or to feel hatred for the once-mighty people who were the victims of it. Culturally, from the eighteenth century on, the German was the first citizen of Europe. In Goethe there was made sublimely articulate a world spirit which knew no boundary lines of nationality, politics, race, or religion, which rejoiced in the inheritance of all mankind, and which wanted no domination or conquest of that inheritance save that of participating in it and contributing to it. This German spirit in art, literature, music, science, and philosophy continued in an unbroken line right down to 1933, and it seemed to George that there was not a man or woman alive in the world who was not, in one way or another, the richer for it.",1
5160,"When he first visited Germany, in 1925, the evidence of that spirit was manifest everywhere in the most simple and unmistakable ways. For example, one could not pass the crowded window of a bookshop in any town without instantly observing in it a reflection of the intellectual and cultural enthusiasm of the German people. The contents of the shop revealed a breadth of vision and of interest that would have made the contents of a French bookshop, with its lingual and geographic constrictions, seem paltry and provincial. The best writers of every country were as well known in Germany as in their own land. Among the Americans, Theodore Dreiser, Sinclair Lewis, Upton Sinclair, and Jack London had particularly large followings; their books were sold and read everywhere. And the work of America's younger writers was eagerly sought out and published.",1
5161,"Even in 1936 this noble enthusiasm, although it had been submerged and mutilated by the regime of Adolf Hitler, was still apparent in the most touching way. George had heard it said that good books could no longer be published and read in Germany. This, he found, was not true, as some of the other things he had heard about Germany were not true. And about Hitler's Germany he felt that one must be very true. And the reason one needed to be very true was that the thing in it which every decent person must be against was false. You could not turn the other cheek to wrong, but also, it seemed to him, you could not be wrong about wrong. You had to be right about it. You could not meet lies and trickery with lies and trickery, although there were some people who argued that you should.",1
5162,"So it was not true that good books could no longer be published and read in Germany. And because it was not true, the tragedy of the great German spirit was more movingly evident, in the devious and distorted ways in which it now manifested itself, than it would have been if it were true. Good books were still published if their substance did not, either openly or by implication, criticise the Hitler regime or contravert its dogmas. And it would simply be stupid to assert that any book must criticise Hitler and contravert his doctrines in order to be good.",1
5163,"For these reasons, the eagerness, curiosity, and enthusiasm of the Germans for such good books as they were still allowed to read had been greatly intensified. They wanted desperately to find out what was going on in the world, and the only way they had left was to read whatever books they could get that had been written outside of Germany. This seemed to be one basic explanation of their continued interest in American writing, and that they were interested was a fact as overwhelming as it was pathetic. Under these conditions, the last remnants of the German spirit managed to survive only as drowning men snrvive--by clutching desperately at any spar that floated free from the wreckage of their ship.",1
5164,"So the weeks, the months, the summer passed, and everywhere about him George saw the evidences of this dissolution, this shipwreck of a great spirit. The poisonous emanations of suppression, persecution, and fear permeated the air like miasmic and pestilential vapours, tainting, sickening, and blighting the lives of everyone he met. It was a plague of the spirit--invisible, but as unmistakable as death. Little by little it sank in on him through all the golden singing of that summer, until at last he felt it, breathed it, lived it, and knew it for the thing it was.  39.",1
5165,"One Big Fool The time had come for George to go. He knew he had to leave, but he had kept putting it off. Twice he had booked his passage back to America and made all his preparations for departure, and twice, as the day approached, he had cancelled the arrangements.",1
5166,"He hated the thought of quitting Germany, for he felt, somehow, that he would never again be able to return to this ancient land he loved so much. And Else--where, and under what alien skies, could he hope to see her again? Her roots were here, his were elsewhere. This would be a last farewell.",1
5167,"So, after delaying and delaying, once more he booked his passage and made his plans to leave Berlin on a day towards the middle of September. The postponement of the dreaded moment had only made it more painful. He would be foolish to draw it out any further. This time he would really go.",1
5168,"And at last came the fateful dawn. The phone beside his bed rang quietly. He stirred, then roused sharply from that fitful and uneasy sleep which a man experiences when he has gone to bed late, knowing that he has to get up early. It was the porter. His low, quiet voice had in it the quality of immediate authority.",1
5169,"It is seven 'o'clock,"" he said. All right,"" George answered. Thank you. I'm awake.",1
5170,"Then he got up, still fighting dismally with a stale fatigue which begged for sleep, as well as with a gnawing tension of anxiety which called for action. One look about the room reassured him. His old leather trunk lay open on the baggage rest. It had been packed the night before with beautiful efficiency by the maid. Now there was very little more to do except to shave and dress, stow toilet things away, pack the brief-case with a few books and letters and the pages of manuscript that always accumulated wherever he was, and drive to the station. Twenty minutes' steady work would find him ready. The train was not due until half-past eight, and the station was not three minutes distant in a taxi-cab. He thrust his feet into his slippers, walked over to the windows, tugged the cord, and pulled up the heavy wooden blinds.",1
5171,"It was a grey morning. Below him, save for an occasional motorcar, the quiet thrum of a bicycle, or someone walking briskly to his work with a lean, spare clack of early morning, the Kurfürstendamm was bare and silent. In the centre of the street, above the tram tracks, the fine trees had already lost their summer freshness--that deep and dark intensity of German green which is the greenest green on earth and which has a kind of forest darkness, a legendary sense of coolness and of magic. The leaves looked faded now, and dusty. They were already touched here and there by the yellowing tinge of autumn. A tram, cream-yellow, spotless, shining like a perfect toy, slid past with a hissing sound upon the rails and at the contacts of the trolley. Except for this, the tram-car made no noise. Like everything the Germans built, the tram and its road-bed were perfect in their function. The rattling and metallic clatter of an American street-car were totally absent. Even the little cobble-stones that paved the space between the tracks were as clean and spotless as if each of them had just been gone over thoroughly with a whisk broom, and the strips of grass that bordered the tracks were as green and velvety as Oxford sward.",1
5172,"On both sides of the street, the great restaurants, cafés, and terraces of the Kurfürstendamm had the silent loneliness that such places always have at that hour of the morning. Chairs were racked upon the tables. Everything was clean and bare and empty. Three blocks away, at the head of the street, the clock on the Gedächtnis-kirche belatedly struck seven times. He could see the great, bleak masses of the church, and in the trees a few birds sang.",1
5173,"Someone knocked upon the door. He turned and crossed and opened it. The waiter stood there with his breakfast tray. He was a boy of fifteen, a blond-haired, solemn child with a fresh pink face. He wore a boiled shirt, and a waiter's uniform which was spotless-clean, but which had obviously been cut off and shortened down a little from the dimensions of some more mature former inhabitant. He marched in solemnly, bearing his tray before him straight towards the table in the centre of the room, stolidly uttering in a guttural and toneless voice his three phrases of English which were:  ""Goot morning, sir,"" as George opened the door  ""If you bleeze, sir,"" as he set the tray down upon the table, and then  ""Dank you ferry much, sir,"" as he marched out and turned to close the door behind him.",1
5174,"The formula had always been the same. All summer it had not varied by a jot, and now as he marched out for the last time George had a feeling of affection and regret. He called to the boy to wait a moment, got his trousers, took some money, and gave it to him. His pink face reddened suddenly with happiness. George shook hands with him, and the boy said gutturally:  ""Dank you ferry much, sir.",1
5175,"And then, very quietly and earnestly: ""Gute reise, mein Herr. He clicked his heels together and bowed formally, and then closed the door. George stood there for a moment with that nameless feeling of affection and regret, knowing that he would never see the boy again. Then he went back to the table and poured out a cup of the hot, rich chocolate, broke a crusty roll, buttered it, spread it with strawberry jam, and ate it. This was all the breakfast he wanted. The pot was still half full of chocolate, the dish was still piled with little scrolls of creamy butter, there was enough of the delicious jam, enough of the crusty rolls and flaky croissants, to make half a dozen breakfasts, but he was not hungry.",1
5176,"He went over to the wash-basin and switched on the light. The large and heavy porcelain bowl was indented in the wall. The wall and the floor beneath were substantial and as perfect as a small but costly bathroom. He brushed his teeth and shaved, packed all the toilet things together in a little leather case, pulled the zipper, and put it away in the old trunk. Then he dressed. By seven-twenty he was ready.",1
5177,"Franz Heilig came in as George was ringing for the porter. He was an astonishing fellow, an old friend of the Munich days, and George was devoted to him. When they had first met, Heilig had been a librarian in Munich. Now he had a post in one of the large libraries of Berlin. In this capacity he was a public functionary, with the prospect of slow but steady advancement through the years. His income was small and his scale of living modest, but such things did not bother Heilig. He was a scholar, with the widest range of knowledge and interests that George had ever known in anyone. He read and spoke a dozen languages. He was German to the very core of his learned soul, but his English, which he spoke less well than any other language he had studied, was not the usual German rendering of Shakespeare's tongue. There were plenty of Germanic elements in it, but in addition Heilig had also borrowed accents and inflections from some of his other linguistic conquests, and the result was a most peculiar and amusing kind of bastard speech.",1
5178,"As he entered the room and saw George he began to laugh, closing his eyes, contorting his small features, and snuffling through his sourly puckered lips as if he had just eaten a half-ripe persimmon. Then his face went sober and he said anxiously:  ""You are ready, zen? You are truly going?""  George nodded.",1
5179,"Yes,"" he said. Everything's all ready. How do you feel, Franz?""  He laughed suddenly, took off his spectacles, and began to polish them.",1
5180,"Without his glasses, his small puckered face had a tired and worn look, and his weak eyes were bloodshot and weary from the night before. 0 Gott! he cried, with a kind of gleeful desperation. I feel perfectly dret-ful! I haf not efen been to bett! After I left you I could not sleep. I valked and valked, almost up to Grunewald... May I tell you somesing? he said earnestly, and peered at George with the serious intensity with which he always uttered these oracular words. I feel like hell--I really do. Then you haven't been to bed at all?",1
5181,"You've had no sleep?""  ""Oh, yes,"" he said wearily. I haf slept an hour. I came back home. My girl vas asleep--I did not vant to get into ze bett wiz her--I did not vant to vake her up. So I laid down upon ze couch. I did not efen take off my clothes. I vas afraid zat I vould come too late to see you at ze station. And zat,"" he said, peering at George most earnestly again, ""vould be too dret-ful!""  ""Why don't you go back home and sleep to-day after the train goes?",1
5182,"George said. I don't think you'll be able to do much work, feeling as you do. Wouldn't it be better if you took the day off and caught up on your sleep?""  ""Veil, zen,"" said Heilig abruptly, yet rather indifferently, ""I vill tell you somesing.",1
5183,"He peered at George earnestly and intently again, and said: ""It does not matter. It really does not matter. I vill take somesing--some coffee or somesing,"" he said indifferently. It vill not be too bad. But Gott!""--again the desperately gleeful laugh--""how I shall sleep to-night! After zat I shall try to get to know my girl again. I hope so, Franz.",1
5184,"She's a nice girl. I'm afraid she hasn't seen much of you the last month or so. Veil, zen,"" said Heilig, as before, ""I vill tell you somesing.",1
5185,"It does not matter. It really does not matter. She is a good girl--she knows about zese sings--you like her, yes?""--and he peered at George eagerly, earnestly, again. You sink she is nice?""  ""Yes, I think she's very nice.",1
5186,"Veil, zen,"" said Heilig, ""I vill tell you somesing. She is very nice. I am glad if you like her. She is very good for me. Ve get along togezzer very vell. I hope zat zey vill let me keep her,"" he said quietly.",1
5187,"They? Who do you mean by 'they', Franz?""  ""Oh,"" he said, wearily, and his small face puckered in an expression of disgust, ""zese people--zese stupid people--zat you know about. But good Lord, Franz!",1
5188,"Surely they have not yet forbidden that, have they? A man is still allowed to have a girl, isn't he? Why you can step right out into the Kurfürstendamm and get a dozen girls before you've walked a block. Oh,"" said Heilig, ""you mean ze little whores.",1
5189,"Yes, you may still go to ze little whores. Zat's quite anozzer matter. You may go to ze little whores and perhaps zey give you somesing--a little poison. But zat is quite all right. You see, my dear shap,"" here his face puckered in a look of impish malice, and he began to speak in the tone of exaggerated and mincing refinement that characterised some of his more vicious utterances, ""I vill now tell you somesing. Under ze Dritte Reich ve are all so happy, everysing is so fine and healsy, zat it is perfectly Gott-tam dret-ful,"" he sneered. Ve may go to ze little whores in ze Kurfürstendamm. Zey vill take you to zeir rooms, or zey vill come wiz you. Yes,"" he said earnestly, nodding, ""zey vill come wiz you to vhere you live--to your room. But you cannot haf a girl. If you haf a girl you must marry her, and--may I tell you? he said frankly--""I cannot marry. I do not make enough money. It vould be quite impossible! he said decisively. And may I tell you zis?"" he continued, pacing nervously up and down and taking rapid puffs at his cigarette. If you haf a girl, zen you must haf two rooms. And zat also is quite impossible! I haf not efen money enough to afford two rooms. You mean, if you are living with a girl you are compelled by law to have two rooms?""  ""It is ze law, yes,"" said Heilig quietly, nodding with the air of finality with which a German states established custom.",1
5190,"You must. If you are liffing wiz a girl, she must haf a room. Zen you can say,"" he went on seriously, ""zat you are hiring wiz each ozzer. She may haf a room right next to you, but zen you can say zat she is not your girl. You may sleep togezzer every night, all you Gott-tam please. But zen, you see, you vill be good. You vill not do some sings against ze Party...Gott! he cried, and, lifting his impish, bitterly puckered face, he laughed again. It is all quite dret-ful!",1
5191,"But if they find, Franz, that you're living with her in a single room?""  ""Veil, zen,"" he said quietly, ""I may tell you zat she vill haf to go. And then, wearily, dismissingly, in a tone of bitter indifference: ""It does not matter. I do not care. I pay no attention to zese stupid people. I haf my vork, I haf my girl. And zat is all zat matters. Ven I am finished wiz my vork, I go home to my little room. My girl is zere, and zis little dog,"" he said, and his face lighted up gleefully again. Zis little dog--may I tell you somesing?--zis little dog--Pooki--ze little Scottie zat you know--I haf become quite fond of him. He is really quite nice,"" said Heilig earnestly. Ven he first came to us I hated him. My girl saw him and she fall in love wiz zis little animal,"" said Heilig. She said zat she must haf him--zat I must be buying him for her. Veil, zen,"" said Heilig, quickly flipping the ash from his cigarette and moving up and down the room, ""I said to her zat I vill not haf zis Gott-tam little beast about my place. He fairly shouted these words to show the emphasis of his intention. Veil, zen, ze girl cry. She talk alvays about zis little dog. She say zat she must haf him, zat she is going to die. Gott! he cried gleefully again, and laughed. It vas perfectly dret-ful. Zere vas no more peace for me. I vould go home at night and instantly she vould begin to cry and say she vill be dying if I do not buy zis little dog. So finally I say: 'All right, haf it your own vay. I vill buy zis little animal!' he said viciously--""'Only for Gott's sake, shut your crying!' So, zen,"" said Heilig impishly, ""I vent to buy zis little dog, and I looked at him. Here his voice became very droll, and with a tremendous sense of comic exaggeration his eyes narrowed, his small face puckered to a grimace, and his discoloured teeth gritted together as he snarled softly and gleefully: ""I looked at zis little dog and I said--'All right, you--you-u-u buh-loody little animalyou-u-u aww-ful--dret-ful--little bee-e-e-st--I vill take you home wiz me--but you--you-u-u damned little beast, you'""--here he gleefully and viciously shook his fist at an imaginary dog--""'if you do some sings I do not like--if you viii be making some buh-loody awful messes in my place, I vill give you somesing to eat zat you will not enchoy'... But zen,"" said Heilig, ""after ve had him, I became quite fond of him. He is quite nice, really. Sometime ven I come home at night and everysing has gone badly and zere haf been so many of zese dret-ful people, he vill come and look at me. He vill talk to me. He vill say he knows zat I am so unhappy. And zat life is very hard. But zat he is my friend. Yes, he is really very nice. I like him very much. During this conversation the porter had come in and was now waiting for his orders.",1
5192,"He asked George if everything was in the leather trunk. George got down on hands and knees and took a final look under the bed. The porter opened doors and drawers. Heilig himself peered inside the big wardrobe and, finding it empty, turned to George with his characteristic expression of surprise and said:  ""Veil, zen, I may tell you zat I sink you have it all.",1
5193,"Satisfied on this score, the porter closed the heavy trunk, locked it, and tightened the straps, while Heilig helped George stuff manuscripts, letters, and a few books into the old brief-case. Then George fastened the brief-case and gave it to the porter. He dragged the baggage out into the hall and said he would wait for them below.",1
5194,"George looked at his watch and found that it still lacked three-quarters of an hour until train time. He asked Heilig if they should go on immediately to the station or wait at the hotel. Ve can vait here,"" he said. I sink it vould be better. If you vait here anozzer half an hour, zere vould still be time. He offered George a cigarette and struck a match for him.",1
5195,"Then they sat down, George at the table, Heilig upon the couch against the wall. And for a minute or two they smoked in silence. Vell, zen,"" said Heilig quietly, ""zis time it is to be good-bye...Zis time you vill really go?""  ""Yes, Franz.",1
5196,"I've got to go this time. I've missed two boats already. I can't miss another one. They smoked in silence for a moment more, and then suddenly, earnestly and anxiously, Heilig said:  ""Vell, zen, may I tell you somesing?",1
5197,"I am sorry. And I, too, Franz. Again they smoked in troubled and uneasy silence.",1
5198,"You vill come back, of gourse,"" said Heilig presently. And then, decisively: ""You must, of gourse. Ve like you here. Another pause, then very simply and quietly: ""You know, ve do so luff you. George was too moved to say anything, and Heilig, peering at him quickly and anxiously, continued:",1
5199,"And you like it here? You like us? Yes! he cried emphatically, in answer to his own question. Of gourse you do!""  ""Of course, Franz.""  ""Zen you must come back,"" he said quietly.",1
5200,"It vould be quite dret-ful if you did not. He looked at George searchingly again, but George said nothing. In a moment Heilig said: ""And I--I shall hope zat ve shall meet again. I hope so, too, Franz,"" said George.",1
5201,"And then, trying to throw off the sadness that had fallen on them, he went on as cheerfully as he could, voicing his desire more than his belief: ""Of course we shall. I shall come back some day, and we shall sit together talking just the same as we are now. Heilig did not answer immediately.",1
5202,"His small face became contorted with the look of bitter and malicious humour which George had seen upon it so often. He took off his glasses quickly, polished them, wiped his tired, weak eyes, and put his glasses on again. You sink so?"" he said, and smiled his wry and bitter smile.",1
5203,"I'm sure of it,"" George said positively, and for the moment he almost believed it. You and I and all the friends we know--we'll sit together drinking, we'll stay up all night and dance around the trees and go to Aenna Maentz at three o'clock in the morning for chicken soup. All of it will be the same. Vell, zen, I hope zat you are right.",1
5204,"But I am not so sure,"" said Heilig quietly. I may not be here. You!",1
5205,"George laughed derisively. Why what are you talking about? You know you wouldn't be happy anywhere else. You have your work, it's what you always wanted to do, and at last you're in the place where you always wanted to be. Your future is mapped out clearly before you--it's just a matter of hanging on until your superiors die off or retire. You'll always be here! I am not so sure,"" he said.",1
5206,"He puffed at his cigarette, and then continued rather hesitantly. You see--zere are zese fools--zese stupid people! He ground his cigarette out viciously in the ashtray, and, his face twisted in a wry smile of defiant, lacerated pride, he cried angrily: ""Myself--I do not care. I do not vorry for myself. Right now I haf my little life--my little chob--my little girl--my little room. Zese people--zese fools! he cried--""I do not notice zem. I do not see zem. It does not bozzer me,"" he cried. And now, indeed, his face had become a grotesque mask. I shall always get along,"" he said. If zey run me out--yell, zen, I may tell you zat I do not care! Zere are ozzer places! he cried bitterly. I can go to England, to Sveden. If zey take my chob, my girl,"" he cried scornfully and waved his hand impatiently, ""may I tell you zat it does not matter. I shall get along. And if zese fools--zese stupid people--if zey take my life--I do not sink zat is so terrible. You sink so? Yes?""  ""Yes, I do think so, Franz.",1
5207,"I should not like to die. Vell, zen,"" said Heilig quietly, ""wiz you it is a different matter. You are American. Wiz us, it is not ze same. I haf seen men shot, in Munich, in Vienna--I do not sink it is too bad. He turned and looked searchingly at George again. No, it is not too bad,"" he said.",1
5208,"Oh hell, you're talking like an idiot,"" George said. No one's going to shoot you. No one's going to take your job or girl away. Why, man, your job is safe. It has nothing to do with politics. And they'd never find another scholar like you. Why, they couldn't do without you. He shrugged his shoulders indifferently and cynically.",1
5209,"I do not know,"" he said. Myself--I think ye can do wizout everybody if ye must. And perhaps ye must. Must?",1
5210,"What do you mean by that, Franz?""  Heilig did not answer for a moment. Then he said abruptly: ""Now I sink zat I vill tell you somesing. In ze last year here, zese fools haf become quite dret-ful. All ze Chews haf been taken from zeir vork, zey haf nozzing to do any more. Zese people come around--some stupid people in zeir uniform""--he said contemptuously--""and zey say zat everyone must be an Aryan man--zis vonderful plue-eyed person eight feet tall who has been Aryan in his family since 1820. If zere is a little Chew back zere--zen it is a pity,"" Heilig jeered. Zis man can no more vork--he is no more in ze Cherman spirit. It is all quite stupid. He smoked in silence for a minute or two, then continued: ""Zis last year zese big fools haf been coming round to me. Zey demand to know who I am, vhere I am from--whezzer or not I haf been born or not. Zey say zat I must prove to zem zat I am an Aryan man. Ozzervise I can no longer vork in ze library. But my God, Franz!",1
5211,"George cried, and stared at him in stupefaction. You don't mean to tell me that--why, you're not a Jew,"" he said, ""are you?""  ""Oh Gott no! Heilig cried, with a sudden shout of gleeful desperation. My dear shap, I am so Gott-tam Cherman zat it is perfectly dret-ful. Well, then,"" George demanded, puzzled, ""what's the trouble?",1
5212,"Why should they bother you? Why worry about it if you're a German?""  Heilig was silent a little while, and the look of wry, wounded humour in his small, puckered face had deepened perceptibly before he spoke again. My dear Chorge,"" he said at last, ""now I may tell you somesing. I am completely Cherman, it is true. Only, my poor dear mozzer--I do so luff her, of course--but Gott! He laughed through his closed mouth, and there was bitter merriment in his face. Gott! She is such a fool! Zis poor lady,"" he said, a trifle contemptuously, ""luffed my fazzer very much--so much, in fact, zat she did not go to ze trouble to marry him. So zese people come and ask me all zese questions: and say: Where is your fazzer!' And of gourse I cannot tell zem. Because, alas, my dear old shap, I am zis bastard. Gott! he cried again, and with eyes narrowed into slits he laughed bitterly out of the corner of his mouth. It is all so dret-ful--so stupid--and so horribly funny!",1
5213,"But Franz! Surely you must know who your father is--you must have heard his name. My Gott, yes!",1
5214,"he cried. Zat is vhat makes it all so funny. You mean you know him, then?",1
5215,"He is living?""  ""But of gourse,"" said Heilig. He is living in Berlin. Do you ever see him?""  ""But of gourse,"" he said again.",1
5216,I see him every veek. Ve are quite good friends. But--then I don't see what the trouble is--unless they can take your job from you because you're a bastard.,1
5217,"It's embarrassing, of course, and all that, both for your father and yourself--but can't you tell them? Can't you explain it to them? Won't your father help you out? I am sure he vould,"" said Heilig, ""if I told zis sing to him.",1
5218,"Only, I cannot tell him. You see,"" he went on quietly, ""my fazzer and I are quite good friends. Ve never speak about zis sing togezzer--ze vay he knew my mozzer. And now, I vould not ask him--I vould not tell him of zis trouble--I vould not vant him to help me--because it might seem zat I vas taking an adwantage. It might spoil everysing. But your father--is he known here?",1
5219,"Would these people know his name if you mentioned it?""  ""Oh Gott yes! Heilig cried out gleefully, and snuffled with bitter merriment. Zat is vhat makes it all so horrible--and so dret-fully amusing. Zey vould know his name at vonce. Perhaps zey vill say zat I am zis little Chew and t'row me out because I am no Aryan man--and my fazzer""--Heilig choked and, snuffling, bent half over in his bitter merriment--""my fazzer is zis loyal Cherman man-- zis big Nazi--zis most important person in ze Party!",1
5220,"For a moment George looked at his friend--whose name, ironically, signified ""the holy one""--and could not speak. This strange and moving illumination of his history explained so much about him--the growing bitterness and disdain towards everyone and everything, the sense of weary disgust and resignation, the cold venom of his humour, and that smile which kept his face almost perpetually puckered up. As he sat there, fragile, small, and graceful, smiling his wry smile, the whole legend of his life became plain. He had been life's tender child, so sensitive, so affectionate, so amazingly intelligent. He had been the fleeceling lamb thrust out into the cold to bear the blast and to endure want and loneliness. He had been wounded cruelly. He had been warped and twisted. He had come to this, and yet he had maintained a kind of bitter integrity.",1
5221,"I'm so sorry, Franz,"" George said. So damned sorry. I never knew of this. Vell, zen,"" said Heilig indifferently, ""I may tell you zat it does not matter.",1
5222,"It really does not matter. He smiled his tortured smile, snuffling a little through his lips, flicked the ash from his cigarette, and shifted his position. I shall do somesing about it. I haf engaged one of zese little men--zese dret-ful little people--vhat do you call zem?--lawyers!--O Gott, but zey are dret-ful! he shouted gleefully. I haf bought one of zem to make some lies for me. Zis little man wiz his papers--he vill feel around until he discover fazzers, mozzers, sisters, brozzers--everysing I need. If he cannot, if zey vill not believe--yell, zen,"" said Heilig, ""I must lose my chob. But it does not matter. I shall do somesing. I shall go somevhere else. I shall get along somehow. I haf done so before, and it vas not too terrible... But zese fools--zese dret-ful people! he said with deep disgust. Some day, my dear Chorge, you must write a bitter book. You must tell all zese people just how horrible zey are. Myself--I haf no talent. I cannot write a book. I can do nozzing but admire vhat ozzers do and know if it is good. But you must tell zese dret-ful people vhat zey are...I haf a little fantasy,"" he went on with a look of impish glee. Ven I feel bad--yen I see all zese dret-ful people valking up and down in ze Kurfürstendamm and sitting at ze tables and putting food into zeir faces-- zen I imagine zat I haf a little ma-chine gun. So I take zis little ma-chine gun and go up and down, and ven I see one of zese dret-ful people I go--ping-ping-ping-pingping! As he uttered these words in a rapid, childish key, he took aim with his hand and hooked his finger rapidly. 0 Gott! he cried ecstatically. I should so enchoy it if I could go around wiz zis little ma-chine gun and use it on all zese stupid fools! But I cannot. My ma-chine gun is only in imagination. Wiz you it is different. You haf a ma-chine gun zat you can truly use. And you must use it,"" he said earnestly. Some day you must write zis bitter book, and you must tell zese fools vhere zey belong. Only,"" he added quickly, and turned anxiously towards George, ""you must not do it yet. Or if you do, you must not say some sings in zis book zat vill make zese people angry wiz you here. What kind of things do you mean, Franz?""  ""Zese sings about""--he lowered his voice and glanced quickly towards the door--""about politics--about ze Party.",1
5223,"Sings zat vould bring zem down on you. It would be quite dret-ful if you did. Why would it?""  ""Because,"" he said, ""you have a great name here.",1
5224,"I don't mean wiz zese fools, zese stupid people, but wiz ze people left who still read books. I may tell you,"" he said earnestly, ""zat you have ze best name here now of any foreign writer. If you should spoil it now--if you should write some sings now zat zey vould not like--it vould be a pity. Ze Reichschriftskammer vould forbid your books--vould tell us zat ve could no longer read you--and ve could not get your books. And zat vould be a pity. Ve do so like you here--I mean ze people who understand. Zey know so vell about you. Zey understand ze vay you feel about sings. And I may tell you zat ze translations are quite marvellous. Ze man who does zem is a poet, and he luffs you--he gets you in, ze vay you feel--your images--ze rhythmus of your writing. And ze people find it very vonderful. Zey cannot believe zat zey are reading a translation. Zey say zat it must haf been written in Cherman in ze beginning. And-0 Gott! he shouted gleefully again--""zey call you everysing--ze American Homer, ze American epic writer. Zey like and understand you so much. Your writing is so full of juice, so round and full of blood. Ze feeling is like feeling zat ve haf. Wiz many people you haf ze greatest name of any writer in ze world to-day. That's a good deal more than I've got at home, Franz.",1
5225,"I know. But zen, I notice, in America zey lull everyvun a year--and zen zey spit upon him. Here, wiz many people you haf zis great name,"" he said earnestly, ""and it vould be too dret-ful--it vould be such a pity--if you spoil it now. You vill not?"" he said, and again looked anxiously and earnestly at George.",1
5226,"George looked off in space and did not answer right away; then he said:  ""A man must write what he must write. A man must do what he must do. Zen you mean zat if you felt zat you had to say some sings--about politics--about zese stupid fools--about----""  ""What about life?",1
5227,"George said. What about people? You vould say it?""  ""Yes, I would.",1
5228,"Efen if it did you harm? Efen if it spoiled you here? Efen if ve could no longer read vhat you write? With his small face peering earnestly at George, he waited anxiously for his reply.",1
5229,"Yes, Franz, even if that happened. Heilig was silent a moment, and then, with apparent hesitancy, he said: Efen if you write somesing--and zey say to you zat you cannot come back?""  George, too, was silent now.",1
5230,"There was much to think of. But at last he said:  ""Yes, even if they told me that. Heilig straightened sharply, with a swift intake of anger and impatience.",1
5231,"Zen I vill tell you somesing,"" he said harshly. You are one big fool. He rose, flung his cigarette away, and began to pace nervously up and down the room. Vhy should you go and spoil yourself?"" he cried. Vhy should you go and write sings now zat vill make it so zat you cannot come back. You do so luff it here! he cried; then turned sharply, anxiously, and said: ""You do, of gourse?""  ""Yes, I do--better than almost any other place on earth.",1
5232,"And ve alzo!"" cried Heilig, pacing up and down. Ve do so luff you, too. You are no stranger to us, Chorge. I see ze people look at you ven you go by upon ze street and zey all smile at you. Zere is somesing about you zat zey like. Ze little girls in ze shirt shop yen ye vent to buy ze shirt for you--zey all said: 'Who is he?' Zey all vanted to know about you. Zey kept ze shop open two hours late, till nine o'clock zat night, so zat ze shirt vould be ready for you. Efen ven you speak zis poor little Cherman zat you speak, all ze people like it. Ze vaiters in ze restaurants come and do sings for you before everybody else, and not because zey vant a tip from you. You are at home here. Everybody understands you. You have zis famous name--to us you are zis great writer. And for a little politics,"" he said bitterly, ""because zere are zese stupid fools, you vould now go and spoil it all. George made no answer.",1
5233,"So Heilig, still walking feverishly up and down, went on:  ""Vhy should you do it? You are no politician. You are no propaganda Party man. You are not one of zese Gott-tam little New York Salon-Kommunisten. He spat the word out viciously, his pale eyes narrowed into slits. May I now tell you somesing? He paused abruptly, looking at George. I hate zese bloody little people--zese damned aest'etes--zese little propaganda literary men. Puckering his face into an expression of mincing disdain, advancing with two fingers pressed together in the air before him, and squinting at them with delicately lidded eyes, he coughed in an affected way--""U-huh, u-huh!""--and then, in a tone of mincing parody, he quoted from an article he had read: ""'HI may say so, ze transparence of ze Darstellung in Vebber's vork...' U-huh, u-huh! he coughed again. Zis bloody little fool who wrote zat piece about you in Die Dame--zis damned little aest'ete wiz zese phrases about 'ze transparence of ze Darstellung'--may I tell you somesing? he shouted violently. I spit upon zese bloody people! Zey are everyvhere ze same. You find zem in London, Paris, Vienna. Zey are bad enough in Europe--but in America! he shouted, his face lighting up with impish glee--""O Gott! If I may tell you so, zey are perfectly dret-ful! Vhere do you get zem from? Efen ze European aest'ete says: 'My Gott! zese bloody men, zese awful people, zese demned aest'etes from ze Oo Ess Ah--zey are too dretful!'""  ""Are you talking now of Communists?",1
5234,"You began on them, you know!""  ""Veil now,"" he said, curtly and coldly, with the arrogant dismissal that was becoming more and more characteristic of him, ""it does not matter. It does not matter vhat zey call zemselves. Zey are all ze same. Zey are zese little expressionismus, surréalismus, Kommunismus people--but really zey can call zemselves anysing, everysing, for zey are nozzing. And may I tell you zat I hate zem. I am so tired of all zese belated little people,"" he said, and turned away with an expression of weariness and disgust. It does not matter. It simly does not matter vhat zey say. For zey know nozzing. You think then, Franz, that all of Communism is like that--that all Communists are just a crowd of parlour fakes?""  ""Oh, die Kommunisten,"" said Heilig wearily.",1
5235,"No, I do not sink zat zey are all fakes. And Kommunismus""--he shrugged his shoulders--""vell, zen, I sink zat it is very good. I sink zat some day ze vorld may live like zat. Only, I do not sink zat you and I will see it. It is too great a dream. And zese sings are not for you. You are not one of zese little propaganda Party people--you are a writer. It is your duty to look around you and to write about ze vorld and people as you see zem. It is not your duty to write propaganda speeches and call zem books. You could not do zat. It is quite impossible. But suppose I write about the world and people as I see them, and come in conflict with the Party--what then?""  ""Zen,"" he said roughly, ""you vill be one big fool.",1
5236,"You can write everysing you need to write wizout zese Party people coming down on you. You do not need to mention zem. And if you do mention zem, and do not say nice sings, zen ye can no longer read you, and you cannot come back. And for vhat vould you do it? If you vere some little propaganda person in New York, you could say zese sings and zen it vould not matter. Because zey can say anysing zey like--but zey know nozzing of us, and it costs zem nozzing. But you--you have so much to lose. Heilig paced back and forth in feverish silence, puffing on his cigarette, then all at once he turned and demanded truculently:  ""You sink it is so bad here now?--ze vay sings are wiz ze Party and zese stupid people?",1
5237,"You sink it vould be better if zere vas anozzer party, like in America? Zen,"" he said, not waiting for an answer, ""I sink you are mistaken. It is bad here, of gourse, but I sink it vill be soon no better wiz you. Zese bloody fools--you find zem everyvhere. Zey are ze same wiz you, only in a different vay. Suddenly he looked at George earnestly and searchingly. You sink zat you are free in America--no? He shook his head and went on: ""I do not sink so. Ze only free ones are zese dret-ful people. Here, zey are free to tell you vhat you must read, vhat you must believe, and I sink zat is also true in America. You must sink and feel ze vay zey do--you must say ze sings zey vant you to say--or zey kill you. Ze only difference is zat here zey haf ze power to do it. In America zey do not haf it yet, but just vait--zey vill get it. Ve Chermans haf shown zem ze vay. And zen, you vould be more free here zan in New York, for here you haf a better name, I sink, zan in America. Here zey admire you. Here you are American, and you could efen write and say sings zat no Cherman could do, so long as you say nozzing zat is against ze Party. Do you sink zat you could do zat in New York?""  He paced the floor in silence for a long moment, pausing to look searchingly at George.",1
5238,"At length he answered his own question:  ""No, you could not. Zese people here--zey say zat zey are Nazis. I sink zat zey are more honest. In New York, zey call zemselves by some fine name. Zey are ze Salon-Kommunisten. Zey are ze Daughters of ze Revolution. Zey are ze American Legion. Zey are ze business men, ze Chamber of Commerce. Zey are one sing and anozzer, but zey are all ze same, and I sink zat zey are Nazis, too. You vill find everyvhere zese bloody people. Zey are not for you. You are not a propaganda man. Again there was a silence.",1
5239,"Heilig continued to pace the floor, waiting for George to say something; when he did not, Heilig went on again. And in his next words he revealed a depth of cynicism and indifference which was greater than George had ever before suspected, and of which he would not have thought Heilig's sensitive soul was capable. If you write somesing now against ze Nazis,"" said Heilig, ""you vill please ze Chews, but you cannot come back to Chermany again, and zat for all of us vould be quite dret-ful. And may I tell you some-sing?"" he cried harshly and abruptly, and glared at George. I do not like zese Gott-tam Chews any more zan I like zese ozzer people. Zey are just as bad. Ven all is going yell wiz zem, zey say: 'Ve spit upon you and your bloody country because ye are so vunderful.' And yen sings are going bad wiz zem, zey become zese little Chewish men zat veep and wring zeir hands and say: 'Ve are only zese poor, downtrodden Chews, and look vhat zey are doing to us.' And may I tell you,"" he cried harshly, ""zat I do not care. I do not sink it matters very much. I sink zat it is stupid vhat zese bloody fools are doing to zese Chews--but I do not care. It does not matter. I haf seen zese Chews yen zey vere high and full of power, and really zey vere dret-ful. Zey vere only for zemselves. Zey spit upon ze rest of us. So it does not matter,"" he repeated harshly. Zey are as bad as all ze ozzers, zese great, fat Chews. If I had my little ma-chine gun, I vould shoot zem, too. Ze only sing I care about more is vhat zese dret-ful fools viii do to Chermany--to ze people. Anxiously, he looked at George and said: ""You do so like ze people, Chorge?""  ""Enormously,"" said George, almost in a whisper, and he was filled with such an overwhelming sadness--for Germany, for the people, and for his friend--that he could say no more.",1
5240,"Heilig caught the full implications of George's whispered tone. He glanced at him sharply. Then he sighed deeply, and his bitterness dropped away.",1
5241,"Yes,"" he said quietly, ""you must, of gourse. Then he added gently: ""Zey are really a good lot. Zey are big fools, of gourse, but zey are not too bad. He was silent a moment.",1
5242,"He ground out his cigarette in the ashtray, sighed again, and then said, a little sadly:  ""Veil, zen, you must do vhat you must do. But you are one big fool. He looked at his watch and put his hand upon George's arm. Come on, old shap. Now it is time to go. George got up, and for a moment they stood looking at each other, then they clasped each other by the hand.",1
5243,"Good-bye, Franz,"" George said. Good-bye, dear Chorge,"" said Heilig quietly. Ve shall miss you very much. And I you,"" George answered.",1
5244,"Then they went out. 40. Last Farewell When they got downstairs the bill was made up and ready, and George paid it. There was no need to count it up, because there never had been a cheat or error in their reckoning. George distributed extra largess to the head porter--a grey, chunky, sternly able Prussian--and to the head waiter. He gave a mark to the smiling boy beside the lift, who clicked his heels together and saluted. He took one final look at the faded, ugly, curiously pleasant furnishings of the little foyer, and said good-bye again, and went swiftly down the steps into the street.",1
5245,"The porter was already there. He had the baggage on the kerb. A taxi was just drawing up, and he stowed the baggage in. George tipped him and shook hands. He also tipped the enormous doorman, a smiling, simple, friendly fellow who had always patted him upon the back as he went in and out. Then he got into the taxi, sat down by Heilig, and gave the driver the address--Bahnhof Am Zoo.",1
5246,"The taxi wheeled about and started up along the other side of the Kurfürstendamm, turned and crossed into the Joachimtalen-strasse, and, three minutes later, drew in before the station. They still had some minutes to wait before the train, which was coming from the Friedrich-strasse, would be there. They gave the baggage to a porter, who said he would meet them on the platform. Then Heilig thrust a coin into the machine and bought a platform ticket. They passed by the ticket inspectors and went up the stairs.",1
5247,"A considerable crowd of travellers was already waiting on the platform. A train was just pulling in out of the west, from the direction of Hanover and Bremen. A number of people got off. On other tracks the glittering trains of the Stadtbahn were moving in and out; their beautiful, shining cars--deep maroon, red, and golden yellow--going from east to west, from west to east, and to all the quarters of the city's compass, were heavily loaded with morning workers. George looked down the tracks towards the east, in the direction from which his train must come, and saw the semaphores, the lean design of tracks, the tops of houses, and the massed greens of the Zoologic Garden. The Stadtbahn trains kept sliding in and out, swiftly, almost noiselessly, discharging streams of hurrying people, taking in others. It was all so familiar, so pleasant, and so full of morning. It seemed that he had known it for ever, and he felt as he always did when he left a city--a sense of sorrow and regret, of poignant unfulfilment, a sense that here were people he could have known, friends he could have had, all lost now, fading, slipping from his grasp, as the inexorable moment of the departing hour drew near.",1
5248,"Far down the platform the doors of the baggage elevator clanged, and the porters pulled trucks loaded with great piles of baggage out upon the platform. And presently George saw his porter advancing with a truck, and among the bags and trunks upon it he could see his own. The porter nodded to him, indicating at about what point he ought to stand.",1
5249,"At this same moment he turned and saw Else coming down the platform towards him. She walked slowly, at her long and rhythmic stride. People followed her with their eyes as she passed by. She was wearing a rough tweed jacket of a light, coarse texture and a skirt of the same material. Everything about her had a kind of incomparable style. She could have worn anything with the same air. Her tall figure was stunning, a strange and moving combination of delicacy and power. Under her arm she was carrying a book, and as she came up she gave it to George. He took her hands, which for so large a woman were amazingly lovely and sensitive, long, white, and slender as a child's, and George noticed that they were cold, and that the fingers trembled.",1
5250,"Else, you have met Herr Heilig, haven't you? Franz, you remember Frau von Kohler? Else turned and surveyed Heilig coldly and sternly.",1
5251,"Heilig answered her look with a stare that was equally unrelenting and hostile. There was a formidable quality in the mutual suspicion they displayed as their eyes met. George had observed the same phenomenon many times before in the encounters of Germans who were either total strangers or who did not know each other well. At once their defences would be up, as if each distrusted the other on sight and demanded full credentials and assurances before relenting into any betrayal of friendliness and confidence. George was used to this sort of thing by now. It was what was to be expected. Just the same, it never failed to be alarming to him when it happened. He could not accustom himself to it and accept it as an inevitable part of life, as so many of these Germans seemed to have done, because he had never seen anything like it at home, or anywhere else in the world before.",1
5252,"Moreover, between these two, the usual manifestations of suspicion were heightened by an added quality of deep, instinctive dislike. As they stood regarding each other, something flashed between them that was as cold and hard as steel, as swift and naked as a rapier thrust. These feelings of distrust and antagonism were communicated in a single moment's silence; then Else inclined her head slightly and sternly and said in her excellent English, which had hardly a trace of accent and revealed its foreignness only by an occasional phrase and the undue precision of her enunciation:  ""I believe we have met, at Grauschmidt's party for George.",1
5253,"I belief so,"" Heilig said. And then, after surveying her a moment longer with a look of truculent hostility, he said coldly: ""And Grauschmidt's drawing in ze Tageblatt--you did not like it--no?""  ""Of George! she spoke derisively, incredulously. Her stern face was suddenly illuminated with a radiant smile. She laughed scornfully and said: ""This drawing by your friend, Grauschmidt--you mean the one that made George look like a wonderful and charming sugar-tenor?""  ""You did not like it, zen?"" said Heilig coldly.",1
5254,"But ja! she cried. As a drawing of a Zuckertenor--as a drawing of Herr Grauschmidt, the way he is himself, the way he sees and feels--it is quite perfect! But George! It looks no more like George than you do!""  ""Zen I may tell you somesing,"" said Heilig coldly and venomously.",1
5255,I sink zat you are very stupid. Ze drawing vas egg-zellent--everybody sought so. Grauschmidt himself said zat it vas vun of ze very best zat he has effer done. He likes it very much. But natürlich!,1
5256,"Else said ironically, and laughed scornfully again. Herr Grauschmidt likes so many things. First of all, he likes himself. He likes everything he does. And he likes music of Puccini,"" she went on rapidly. He sings Ave Maria. He likes sob-songs of Hilbach. He likes dark rooms with a red light and silken pillows. He is romantic and likes to talk about his feelings. He thinks: 'We artists!'""  Heilig was furious.",1
5257,"If I may tell you somesing----"" he began. But Else now could not be checked. She took a short and angry step away, then turned again, with two spots of passionate colour in her cheeks:  ""Your friend, Herr Grauschmidt,"" she continued, ""likes to talk of art.",1
5258,"He says: 'This orchestra is wonderful!'--he never hears the music. He goes to see Shakespeare, saying; 'Mayer is a wonderful actor.' He----""  ""If I may tell you somesing----"" Heilig choked.",1
5259,"He likes little girls with high heels,"" she panted. He is in the Ess Ah. When he shaves, he wears a hair-dress cap. Of course his nails are polished. He has a lot of photographs--of himself and other great people! And, panting but triumphant, she turned and walked away a few paces to compose herself.",1
5260,"Zese bloody people! Heilig grated. 0 Gott, but zey are dretful! Turning to George, he said venomously: ""If I may tell you somesing--zis person--zis voman--zis von Kohler zat you like so much--she iss a fool! Wait a minute, Franz.",1
5261,"I don't think she is. You know what I think of her. Vell, zen,"" said Heilig, ""you are wrong.",1
5262,"You are mistaken. If I may say so, you are again also one big fool. Vell, zen, it does not matter,"" he cried harshly. I vill go and buy some cigarettes, and you can try to talk to zis damn stupid voman. And, still choking with rage, he turned abruptly and walked away down the platform.",1
5263,"George went up to Else. She was still excited, still breathing rapidly. He took her hands and they were trembling. She said:  ""This bitter little man--this man whose name it means 'the holy one'--he is so full of bitterness--he hates me.",1
5264,"He is so jealous for you. He wants to keep you for himself. He has told you lies. He has tried to say things against me. I hear them! she went on excitedly. People come to me with them! I do not listen to them! she cried angrily. 0 George, George! she said suddenly, and took him by the arms. Do not listen to this bitter little man. Last night,"" she whispered, ""I had a strange dream. It was a so strange, a so good and wonderful dream that I had for you. You must not listen to this bitter man! she cried earnestly, and shook him by the arms. You are religious man. You are artist. And the artist is religious man. Just then Lewald appeared on the platform and came towards them.",1
5265,"His pink face looked fresh and hearty as always. His constant exuberance had in it a suggestion of alcoholic stimulation. Even at this hour of the morning he seemed to be bubbling over with a veiny exhilaration. As he barged along, swinging his great shoulders and his bulging belly, people all along the platform caught the contagion of his gleeful spirits and smiled at him, and yet their smiles, were also tinged with respect. In spite of his great pink face and his enormous belly, there was nothing ridiculous in Lewald's appearance. One's first impression was that of a strikingly handsome man. One did not think of him as being fat; rather, one thought of him as being big. And as he rolled along, he dominated the scene with a sense of easy and yet massive authority. One would scarcely have taken him for a business man, and a very shrewd and crafty one to boot. Everything about him suggested a natural and instinctive Bohemianism. Looking at him, one felt that here, probably, was an old army man, not of the Prussian military type, but rather a fellow who had done his service and who had thoroughly enjoyed the army life--the boisterous camaraderie of men, the eating and drinking bouts, the adventures with the girls--as, indeed, he had.",1
5266,"A tremendous appetite for life was plainly legible all over him. People recognized it the moment they saw him, and that is why they smiled. He seemed so full of wine, so full of spacious, hearty unconventionality. His whole manner proclaimed him to be the kind of man who has burst through all the confines of daily, routine living with the force of a natural element. He was one of those men who, immediately somehow, shine out luminously in all the grey of life, one of those men who carry about their persons a glamorous aura of warmth, of colour, and of temperament. In any crowd he stood out in dominant and exciting isolation, drawing all eyes to himself with a vivid concentration of interest, so that one would remember him later even though one had seen him only for an instant, just as one would remember the one room in an otherwise empty house that had furniture and a fire in it.",1
5267,"So now, as he approached, even when he was still some yards away, he began to shake his finger at George waggishly, at the same time moving his great head from side to side. As he came up, he sang out in a throaty, vinous voice the opening phrases of an obscene song which he had taught to George, and which the two of them had often sung together during those formidable evenings at his house:  ""Lecke du, lecke du, lecke du die Katze am Arsch...""  Else flushed, but Lewald checked himself quickly at the penultimate moment and, wagging his finger at George again, cried:  ""Ach du! And then, in an absurdly sly and gleeful croon, his small eyes twinkling roguishly: ""Naught-ee boy-ee! Naught-ee boy-ee!""--wagging a finger all the time. My old Chorge! he cried suddenly and heartily. There haf you been--you naught-ee boy-ee? I look for you last night and I cannot see you anyvheres!",1
5268,"Before George could answer, Heilig returned, smoking a cigarette. George remembered that the two men had met before, but now they gave no sign of recognition. Indeed, Lewald's hearty manner dropped away at sight of the little Heilig, and his face froze into an expression of glacial reserve and suspicion. George was so put out by this that he forgot his own manners, and instead of presenting Else to Lewald, he stammered out an introduction of Heilig. Lewald then acknowledged the other's presence with a stiff and formal little bow. Heilig merely inclined his head slightly and returned Lewald's look coldly. George was feeling very uncomfortable and embarrassed when Lewald took the situation in hand again. Turning his back on Heilig, he now resumed his former manner of hearty exuberance and, seizing George's arm in one meaty fist and pounding affectionately upon it with the other, he cried out loudly:  ""Chorge!",1
5269,"Vhere haf you been, you naught-ee boy-ee? Vhy do you not come in to see me dese last days? I vas eggsbecting you. Why--I--I--"" George began, ""I really meant to, Karl.",1
5270,"But I knew you would be here to see me off, and I just didn't get around to dropping in at your office again. I've had a great deal to do, you know. And I also!"" cried Lewald, his voice rising in droll emphasis on the last word.",1
5271,"I alzo! he repeated. But me--I alvays haf time for mein friends,"" he said accusingly, still beating away on George's arm to show that his pretended hurt had not really gone very deep.",1
5272,"Karl,"" George now said, ""you remember Frau von Kohler, don't you?""  ""Aber natürlich! he cried with the boisterous gallantry that always marked his manner with women. Honourable lady,"" he said in German, ""how are you? I shall not be likely to forget the pleasure you gave me by coming to one of my parties. But I have not seen you since that evening, and I have seen less and less of old Chorge since then. Relapsing into English at this point, he turned to George again and shook his finger at him, saying: ""You naught-ee boy-ee, you!",1
5273,"This playful gallantry had no effect on Else. Her face did not relax any of its sternness. She just looked at Lewald with her level gaze and made no effort to conceal the scorn she felt for him. Lewald, however, appeared not to notice, for once more he turned to her and addressed her in his exuberant German:  ""Honourable lady, I can understand the reason why the Chorge has deserted me.",1
5274,"He has found more exciting adventures than anything the poor old Lewald had to offer him. Here he turned back to George again and, with his small eyes twinkling mischievously, he wagged his finger beneath George's nose and crooned slyly, absurdly: ""Naught-ee boy-ee! Naught-ee boy-ee!""--as if to say: ""Aha, you rascal, you! I've caught you now!",1
5275,"This whole monologue had been delivered almost without a pause in Lewald's characteristic manner--a manner that had been famous throughout Europe for thirty years. His waggishness with George was almost childishly naive and playful, while his speech to Else was bluff, high-spirited, hearty, and good-humoured. Through it all he gave the impression of a man who was engagingly open and sincere, and one who was full of jolly good will towards mankind. It was the manner George had seen him use many times--when he was meeting some new, author, when he was welcoming someone to his office, when he was talking over the telephone, or inviting friends to a party.",1
5276,"But now again, George was able to observe the profound difference between the manner and the man. The bluff and hearty openness was just a mask which Lewald used against the world with all the deceptive grace and subtlety of a great matador preparing to give the finishing stroke to a charging bull. Behind that mask was concealed the true image of the man's soul, which was sly, dexterous, crafty, and cunning. George noticed again how really small and shrewd were the features. The big blond head and the broad shoulders and the great, pink, vinous jowls gave an effect of massive size and grandeur, but that general effect was not borne out by the smaller details. The mouth was amazingly tiny and carnal; it was full of an almost obscene humour, and it had a kind of mousing slyness, as if its fat little chops were fairly watering for lewd tidbits. The nose was also small and pointed, and there was a sniffing shrewdness about it. The eyes were little, blue, and twinkled with crafty merriment. One felt that they saw everything--that they were not only secretly and agreeably aware of the whole human comedy, but were also slyly amused at the bluff and ingenuous part that their owner was playing.",1
5277,"But come, now! Lewald cried suddenly, throwing back his shoulders and seeming to collect himself to earnestness with a jerk. I bring somet'ing to you from mein hosband...Was? He looked round at all three of them with an expression of innocent, questioning bewilderment as George grinned.",1
5278,"It was a familiar error of his broken English. He always called his wife his ""hosband"", and frequently told George that some day he, too, would get a ""good hosband"". But he used the word with an expression of such droll innocence, his little blue eyes twinkling in his pink face with a look of cherubic guilelessness, that George was sure he knew better and was making the error deliberately for its comic effect. Now, as George laughed, Lewald turned to Else, then to Heilig, with a puzzled air, and in a lowered voice said rapidly:  ""Was, denn?",1
5279,"Was meint Chorge? Wie sagt man das? Ist das nicht richtig englisch?""  Else looked pointedly away as though she had not heard him and wished to have nothing more to do with him.",1
5280,"Heilig's only answer was to continue looking at him coldly and suspiciously. Lewald, however, was not in the least put out by the unappreciativeness of his audience. He turned back to George with a comical shrug, as if the whole thing were quite beyond him, and then slipped into George's pocket a small flask of German brandy, saying that it was the gift his ""hosband"" had sent. Next he took out a thin and beautifully bound little volume which one of his authors had written and illustrated. He held it in his hand and fingered through it lovingly.",1
5281,"It was a comic memoir of Lewald's life, from the cradle to maturity, done in that vein of grotesque brutality which hardly escapes the macabre, but which nevertheless does have a power of savage caricature and terrible humour such as no other race can equal. One of the illustrations showed the infant Lewald as the infant Hercules strangling two formidable-looking snakes, which bore the heads of his foremost publishing rivals. Another showed the adolescent Lewald as Gargantua, drowning out his native town of Kolberg in Pomerania. Still another pictured Lewald as the young publisher, seated at a table in Aenna Maentz café and biting large chunks out of a drinking-glass and eating them--an operation which he had actually performed on various occasions in the past, in order, as he said, ""to make propaganda for meinself and mein business. Lewald had inscribed and autographed this curious little book for George, and underneath the inscription had written the familiar and obscene lines of the song: ""Lecke du, lecke du, lecke du die Katze am Arsch.",1
5282,"Now he closed the book and thrust it into George's pocket. And even as he did so there was a flurry of excitement in the crowd. A light flashed, the porters moved along the platform. George looked up the tracks. The train was coming. It bore down swiftly, sweeping in round the edges of the Zoologic Garden. The huge snout of the locomotive, its fenders touched with trimmings of bright red, advanced bluntly, steamed hotly past, and came to a stop. The dull line of the coaches was broken vividly in the middle with the glittering red of the Mitropa dining-car.",1
5283,"Everybody swung into action. George's porter, heaving up his heavy baggage, clambered quickly up the steps and found a compartment for him. There was a blur of voices all round, an excited tumult of farewell.",1
5284,"Lewald caught George by the hand, and with his other arm around George's shoulder half-pounded and half-hugged him, saying: ""My old Chorge, auf wiedersehen! Heilig shook hands hard and fast, his small and bitter face contorted as if he were weeping, while he said in a curiously vibrant, deep, and tragic voice: ""Good-bye, good-bye, dear Chorge, auf wiedersehen. The two men turned away, and Else put her arms round him.",1
5285,"He felt her shoulders shake. She was weeping, and he heard her say: ""Be good man. Be great one that I know. Be religious man. And as her embrace tightened, she half-gasped, half-whispered: ""Promise. He nodded. Then they came together: her thighs widened, dosed about his leg, her voluptuous figure yielded, grew into him, their mouths clung fiercely, and for the last time they were united in the embrace of love.",1
5286,"Then he climbed into the train. The guard slammed the door. Even as he made his way down the narrow corridor towards his compartment, the train started. These forms, these faces, and these lives all began to slide away.",1
5287,"Heilig kept walking forward, waving his hat, his face still contorted with the grimace of his sorrow. Behind him, Else walked along beside the train, her face stern and lonely, her arm lifted in farewell. Lewald whipped off his hat and waved it, his fair hair in disarray above his flushed and vinous face. The last thing George heard was his exuberant voice raised in a shout of farewell. Old Chorge, auf wiedersehen! And then he cupped his hands round his mouth and yelled: ""Lecke du----! George saw his shoulders heave with laughter.",1
5288,"Then the train swept out around the curve. And they were lost. 41. Five Passengers for Paris The train gathered speed. The streets and buildings in the western I part of the city slipped past--those solid, ugly streets, those massive, ugly buildings in the Victorian German style, which yet, with all the pleasant green of trees, the window-boxes bright with red geraniums, the air of order, of substance, and of comfort, had always seemed as familiar and as pleasant to George as the quiet streets and houses of a little town. Already they were sweeping through Charlottenburg. They passed the station without halting, and on the platforms George saw, with the old and poignant feeling of regret and loss, the people waiting for the Stadtbahn trains. Upon its elevated track the great train swept on smoothly towards the west, gathering momentum steadily. They passed the Funkturma. Almost before he knew it they were rushing through the outskirts of the city towards the open country. They passed an aviation field. He saw the hangars and a flock of shining 'planes. And as he looked, a great silver-bodied 'plane moved out, sped along the runway, lofted its tail, broke slowly from the earth, and vanished.",1
5289,"And now the city was left behind. Those familiar faces, forms, and voices of just six minutes past now seemed as remote as dreams, imprisoned there as in another world--a world of massive brick and stone and pavements, a world hived of four million lives, of hope and fear and hatred, of anguish and despair, of love, of cruelty and devotion, that was called Berlin. And now the land was stroking past, the level land of Brandenburg, the lonely flatland of the north which he had always heard was so ugly, and which he had found so strange, so haunting, and so beautiful. The dark solitude of the forest was around them now, the loneliness of the kiefern-trees, tall, slender, towering, and as straight as sailing masts, bearing upon their tops the slender burden of their needled and eternal green. Their naked poles shone with that lovely gold-bronze colour which is like the material substance of a magic light. And all between was magic, too. The forest dusk beneath the kieferntrees was gold-brown also, the earth gold-brown and barren, and the trees themselves stood alone and separate, a polelike forest filled with haunting light.",1
5290,"Now and then the light would open and the woods be gone, and they would sweep through the level cultivated earth, tilled thriftily to the very edges of the track. He could see the clusters of farm buildings, the red-tiled roofs, the cross-quarterings of barns and houses. Then they would find the haunting magic of the woods again.",1
5291,"George opened the door of his compartment and went in and took a seat beside the door. On the other side, in the corner by the window, a young man sat and read a book. He was an elegant young man and dressed most fashionably. He wore a sporting kind of coat with a small and fancy check, a wonderful vest of some expensive doelike grey material, cream-grey trousers pleated at the waist, also of a rich, expensive weave, and grey suede gloves. He did not look American or English. There was a foppish, almost sugared elegance about his costume that one felt, somehow, was Continental. Therefore it struck George with a sense of shock to see that he was reading an American book, a popular work in history which had the title, The Saga of Democracy, and bore the imprint of a well-known firm. But while he pondered on this puzzling combination of the familiar and the strange there were steps outside along the corridor, voices, the door was opened, and a woman and a man came in.",1
5292,"They were Germans. The woman was small and no longer young, but she was plump, warm, seductive-looking, with hair so light it was the colour of bleached straw, and eyes as blue as sapphires. She spoke rapidly and excitedly to the man who accompanied her, then turned to George and asked if the other places were unoccupied. He replied that he thought so, and looked questioningly at the dapper young man in the corner. This young man now spoke up in somewhat broken German, saying that he believed the other seats were free, and adding that he had got on the train at the Friedrich-strasse station and had seen no one else in the compartment. The woman immediately and vigorously nodded her head in satisfaction and spoke with rapid authority to her companion, who went out and presently returned with their baggage--two valises, which he arranged upon the rack above their heads.",1
5293,"They were a strangely assorted pair. The woman, although most attractive, was obviously much the older of the two. She appeared to be in her late thirties or early forties. There were traces of fine wrinkles at the corners of her eyes, and her face gave an impression of physical maturity and warmth, together with the wisdom that comes from experience, but it was also apparent that some of the freshness and resilience of youth had gone out of it. Her figure had an almost shameless sexual attraction, the kind of naked allure that one often sees in people of the theatre--in a chorus girl or in the strip-tease woman of a burlesque show. Her whole personality bore a vague suggestion of the theatrical stamp. In everything about her there was that element of heightened vividness which seems to set off and define people who follow the stage.",1
5294,"Beside her assurance, her air of practice and authority, her sharply vivid stamp, the man who accompanied her was made to seem even younger than he was. He was probably twenty-six or thereabouts, but he looked a mere stripling. He was a tall, blond, fresh-complexioned, and rather handsome young German who conveyed an indefinable impression of countrified and slightly bewildered innocence. He appeared nervous, uneasy, and inexperienced in the art of travel. He kept his head down or averted most of the time, and did not speak unless the woman spoke to him. Then he would flush crimson with embarrassment, the two flags of colour in his fresh, pink face deepening to beetlike red.",1
5295,"George wondered who they were, why they were going to Paris, and what the relation between them could be. He felt, without exactly knowing why, that there was no family connection between them. The young man could not be the woman's brother, and it was also evident that they were not man and wife. It was hard not to fall back upon an ancient parable and see in them the village hayseed in the toils of the city siren--to assume that she had duped him into taking her to Paris, and that the fool and his money would soon be parted. Yet there was certainly nothing repulsive about the woman to substantiate this conjecture. She was decidedly a most attractive and engaging creature. Even her astonishing quality of sexual magnetism, which was displayed with a naked and almost uncomfortable openness, so that one felt it the moment she entered the compartment, had nothing vicious in it. She seemed, indeed, to be completely unconscious of it, and simply expressed herself sensually and naturally with the innocent warmth of a child.",1
5296,"While George was busy with these speculations the door of the compartment opened again and a stuffy-looking little man with a long nose looked in, peered about truculently, and rather suspiciously, George thought, and then demanded to know if there was a free seat in the compartment. They all told him that they thought so. Upon receiving this information, he, too, without another word, disappeared down the corridor, to reappear again with a large valise. George helped him to stow it away upon the rack. It was so heavy that the little man could probably not have managed it by himself, yet he accepted this service sourly and without a word of thanks, hung up his overcoat, and fidgeted and worried around, took a newspaper from his pocket, sat down opposite George and opened it, banged the compartment door shut rather viciously, and, after peering round mistrustfully at all the other people, rattled his paper and began to read.",1
5297,"While he read his paper George had a chance to observe this sour-looking customer from time to time. Not that there was anything sinister about the man--decidedly there was not. He was just a drab, stuffy, irascible little fellow of the type that one sees a thousand times a day upon the streets, muttering at taxi-cabs or snapping at imprudent drivers--the type that one is always afraid he is going to encounter on a trip but hopes fervently he won't. He looked like the kind of fellow who would always be slamming the door of the compartment to, always going over and banging down the window without asking anyone else about it, always fidgeting and fuming about and trying by every crusty, crotchety, cranky, and ill-tempered method in his equipment to make himself as unpleasant, and his travelling companions as uncomfortable, as possible.",1
5298,"Yes, he was certainly a well-known type, but aside from this he was wholly unremarkable. If one had passed him in the streets of the city, one would never have taken a second look at him or remembered him afterwards. It was only when he intruded himself into the intimacy of a long journey and began immediately to buzz and worry around like a troublesome hornet that he became memorable.",1
5299,"It was not long, in fact, before the elegant young gentleman in the corner by the window almost ran afoul of him. The young fellow took out an expensive-looking cigarette-case, extracted a cigarette, and then, smiling engagingly, asked the lady if she objected to his smoking. She immediately answered, with great warmth and friendliness, that she minded not at all. George received this information with considerable relief, and took a packet of cigarettes from his pocket and was on the point of joining his unknown companion in the luxury of a smoke when old Fuss-and-Fidget rattled his paper viciously, glared sourly at the elegant young man and then at George, and, pointing to a sign upon the wall of the compartment, croaked dismally:  ""Nicht Raucher.",1
5300,"Well, all of them had known that at the beginning, but they had not supposed that Fuss-and-Fidget would make an issue of it. The young fellow and George glanced at each other with a slightly startled look, grinned a little, caught the lady's eye, which was twinkling with the comedy of the occasion, and were obediently about to put their cigarettes away unsmoked when old Fuss-and-Fidget rattled his paper, looked sourly round at them a second time, and then said bleakly that as far as he was concerned it was all right--he didn't personally mind their smoking--he just wanted to point out that they were in a non-smoking compartment. The implication plainly was that from this time on the crime was on their own heads, that he had done what he could as a good citizen to warn them, but that if they proceeded with their guilty plot against the laws of the land, it was no further concern of his. Being thus reassured, they produced their cigarettes again and lighted up.",1
5301,"Now while George smoked, and while old Fuss-and-Fidget read his paper, George had further opportunity to observe this unpleasant companion of the voyage. And his observations, intensified as they were by subsequent events, became fixed as an imperishable image in his mind. The image which occurred to him as he sat there watching the man was that of a sour-tempered Mr. Punch. If you can imagine Mr. Punch without his genial spirits, without his quick wit, without his shrewd but kind intelligence, if you can imagine a crotchety and cranky Mr. Punch going about angrily banging doors and windows shut, glaring round at his fellow-travellers, and sticking his long nose into everybody's business, then you will get some picture of this fellow. Not that he was hunchbacked and dwarfed like Mr. Punch. He was certainly small, he was certainly a drab, unlovely little figure of a man, but he was not dwarfed. But his face had the ruddy glow that one associates with Mr. Punch, and its contour, like that of Mr. Punch, was almost cherubic, except that the cherub had gone sour. The nose also was somewhat Punchian. It was not grotesquely hooked and beaked, but it was a long nose, and its fleshy tip drooped over as if it were fairly sniffing with suspicion, fairly stretching with eagerness to pry around and stick itself into things that did not concern it.",1
5302,"George fell asleep presently, leaning against the side of the door. It was a fitful and uneasy coma of half-sleep, the product of excitement and fatigue--never comfortable, never whole--a dozing sleep from which he would start up from time to time to look about him, then doze again. Time after time he came sharply awake to find old Fussand-Fidget's eyes fixed on him in a look of such suspicion and ill-temper that it barely escaped malevolence. He woke up once to find the man's gaze fastened on him in a stare that was so protracted, so unfriendly, that he felt anger boiling up in him. It was on the tip of his tongue to speak hotly to the fellow, but he, as if sensing George's intent, ducked his head quickly and busied himself again with his newspaper.",1
5303,"The man was so fidgety and nervous that it was impossible to sleep longer than a few minutes at a time. He was always crossing and uncrossing his legs, always rattling his newspaper, always fooling with the handle of the door, doing something to it, jerking and pulling it, half opening the door and banging it to again, as if he were afraid it was not securely closed. He was always jumping up, opening the door, and going out into the corridor, where he would pace up and down for several minutes, turn and look out of the windows at the speeding landscape, then fidget back and forth in the corridor again, sour-faced and distempered-looking, holding his hands behind him and twiddling his fingers nervously and impatiently as he walked.",1
5304,"All this while, the train was advancing across the country at terrific speed. Forest and field, village and farm, tilled land and pasture stroked past with the deliberate but devouring movement of high velocity. The train slackened a little as it crossed the Elbe, but there was no halt. Two hours after its departure from Berlin it was sweeping in beneath the arched, enormous roof of the Hanover station. There was to be a stop of ten minutes. As the train slowed down, George awoke from his doze. But fatigue still held him, and he did not get up.",1
5305,"Old Fuss-and-Fidget arose, however, and, followed by the woman and her companion, went out on the platform for a little fresh air and exercise. George and the dapper young man in the corner were now left alone together. The latter had put down his book and was looking out of the window, but after a minute or two he turned to George and said in English, marked by a slight accent:",1
5306,"Where are we now?""  George told him they were at Hanover. I'm tired of travelling,"" the young man said with a sigh. I shall be glad when I get home. And where is home for you?",1
5307,"George asked. New York,"" he said, and, seeing a look of slight surprise on George's face, he added quickly: ""Of course I am not American by birth, as you can see from the way I talk. But I am a naturalised American, and my home is in New York. George told him that he lived there, too.",1
5308,"Then the young man asked if George had been long in Germany. All summer,"" George replied. I arrived in May. And you have been here ever since--in Germany?""  ""Yes,"" said George, ""except for ten days in the Tyrol.",1
5309,"When you came in this morning I thought at first that you were German. I believe I saw you on the platform with some German people. Yes, they were friends of mine.",1
5310,"But then when you spoke I saw you could not be a German from your accent. When I saw you reading the Paris Herald I concluded that you were English or American. I am American, of course. Yes, I can see that now.",1
5311,"I,"" he said, ""am Polish by birth. I went to America when I was fifteen years old, but my family still lives in Poland. And you have been to see them, naturally?""  ""Yes.",1
5312,"I have made a practice of coming over every year or so to visit them. I have two brothers living in the country. It was evident that he came from landed people. I am returning from there now,"" he said. He was silent for a moment, and then said with some emphasis: ""But not again! Not for a long time will I visit them. I have told them that it is enough--if they want to see me now, they must come to New York. I am sick of Europe,"" he went on. Every time I come I am fed up. I am tired of all this foolish business, these politics, this hate, these armies, and this talk of war--the whole damned stuffy atmosphere here! he cried indignantly and impatiently, and, thrusting his hand into his breast pocket, he pulled out a paper--""Will you look at this?""  ""What is it?",1
5313,"George said. A paper--a permit--the damn thing stamped and signed which allows me to take twenty-three marks out of Germany. Twenty-three marks! he repeated scornfully--""as if I want their God-damn money!""  ""I know,"" George said.",1
5314,"You've got to get a paper every time you turn round. You have to declare your money when you come in, you have to declare it when you go out. If you send home for money, you have to get a paper for that, too. I made a little trip to Austria as I told you. It took three days to get the papers that would allow me to take my own money out. Look here! he cried, and reached in his pocket and pulled out a fistful of papers. I got all of these in one summer. The ice was broken now.",1
5315,"Upon a mutual grievance they began to warm up to each other. It quickly became evident to George that his new acquaintance, with the patriotic fervour of his race, was passionately American. He had married an American girl, he said. New York, he asserted, was the most magnificent city on earth, the only place he cared to live, the place he never wished to leave again, the place to which he was aching to return.",1
5316,"And America? Oh,"" he said, ""it will be good after all this to be back there where all is peace and freedom--where all is friendship--where all is love. George felt some reservations to this blanket endorsement of his native land, but he did not utter them.",1
5317,"The man's fervour was so genuine that it would have been unkind to try to qualify it. And besides, George, too, was homesick now, and the man's words, generous and whole-hearted as they were, warmed him with their pleasant glow. He also felt, beneath the extravagance of the comparison, a certain truth. During the past summer, in this country which he had known so well, whose haunting beauty and magnificence had stirred him more deeply than had any other he had ever known, and for whose people he had always had the most affectionate understanding, he had sensed for the first time the poisonous constrictions of incurable hatreds and insoluble politics, the whole dense weave of intrigue and ambition in which the tormented geography of Europe was again enmeshed, the volcanic imminence of catastrophe with which the very air was laden, and which threatened to erupt at any moment.",1
5318,"And George, like the other man, was weary and sick at heart, exhausted by these pressures, worn out with these tensions of the nerves and spirit, depleted by the cancer of these cureless hates which had not only poisoned the life of nations but had eaten in one way or another into the private lives of all his friends, of almost everyone that he had known here. So, like his new-found fellow countryman, he too felt, beneath the extravagance and intemperance of the man's language, a certain justice in the comparison. He was aware, as indeed the other must have been, of the huge sum of all America's lacks. He knew that all, alas, was not friendship, was not freedom, was not love beyond the Atlantic. But he felt, as his new friend must also have felt, that the essence of America's hope had not been wholly ruined, its promise of fulfilment not shattered utterly. And like the other man, he felt that it would be very good to be back home again, out of the poisonous constrictions of this atmosphere--back home where, whatever America might lack, there was still air to breathe in, and winds to clear the air.",1
5319,"His new friend now said that he was engaged in business in New York. He was a member of a brokerage concern in Wall Street. This seemed to call for some similar identification on George's part, and he gave the most apt and truthful statement he could make, which was that he worked for a publishing house. The other then remarked that he knew the family of a New York publisher, that they were, in fact, good friends of his. George asked him who these people were, and he answered:  ""The Edwards family.",1
5320,"Instantly, a thrill of recognition pierced George. A light flashed on, and suddenly he knew the man. He said:  ""I know the Edwardses.",1
5321,"They are among the best friends I have, and Mr. Edwards is my publisher. And you""--George said--""your name is Johnnie, isn't it? I have forgotten your last name, but I have heard it.",1
5322,"He nodded quickly, smiling. Yes, Johnnie Adamowski,"" he said. And you?--what is your name? George told him.",1
5323,"Of course,"" he said. I know of you.",1
5324,"So instantly they were shaking hands delightedly, with that kind of stunned but exuberant surprise which reduces people to the banal conclusion that ""It's a small world after all. George's remark was simply: ""I'll be damned! Adamowski's, more urbane, was: ""It is quite astonishing to meet you in this way. It is very strange--and yet in life it always happens.",1
5325,"And now, indeed, they began to establish contact at many points. They found that they knew in common scores of people. They discussed them enthusiastically, almost joyfully. Adamowski had been away from home just one short month, and George but five, but now, like an explorer returning from the isolation of a polar voyage that had lasted several years, George eagerly demanded news of his friends, news from America, news from home.",1
5326,"By the time the other people returned to the compartment and the train began to move again, George and Adamowski were deep in conversation. Their three companions looked somewhat startled to hear this rapid fire of talk and to see this evidence of acquaintance between two people who had apparently been strangers just ten minutes before. The little blonde woman smiled at them and took her seat; the young man also. Old Fuss-and-Fidget glanced quickly, sharply, from one to the other of them and listened attentively to all they said, as if he thought that by straining his ears to catch every strange syllable he might be able somehow to fathom the mystery of this sudden friendship.",1
5327,"The cross-fire of their talk went back and forth, from George's corner of the compartment to Adamowski's. George felt a sense of embarrassment at the sudden intrusion of this intimacy in a foreign language among fellow-travellers with whom he had heretofore maintained a restrained formality. But Johnnie Adamowski was evidently a creature of great social ease and geniality. He was troubled not at all. From time to time he smiled in a friendly fashion at the three Germans as if they, too, were parties to the conversation and could understand every word of it.",1
5328,"Under this engaging influence, everyone began to thaw out visibly. The little blonde woman began to talk in an animated way to her young man. After a while Fuss-and-Fidget chimed in with those two, so that the whole compartment was humming with the rapid interplay of English and German.",1
5329,"Adamowski now asked George if he would not like some refreshment. Of course I myself am not hungry,"" Adamowski said indifferently. In Poland I have had to eat too much. They eat all the time, these Polish people. I had decided that I would eat no more until I got to Paris. I am sick of food. But would you like some Polish fruits?"" he said, indicating a large paper-covered package at his side. I believe they have prepared some things for me,"" he said casually--""some fruits from my brother's estate, some chickens and some partridges. I do not care for them myself. I have no appetite. But wouldn't you like something?""  George told him no, that he was not hungry either.",1
5330,"Thereupon Adamowski suggested that they might seek out the Speisewagen and get a drink. I still have these marks,"" he said indifferently. I spent a few for breakfast, but there are seventeen or eighteen left. I shall not want them any longer. I should not have used them. But now that I have met you, I think it would be nice if I could spend them. Shall we go and see what we can find?""  To this George agreed.",1
5331,"They arose, excused themselves to their companions, and were about to go out when old Fuss-and-Fidget surprised them by speaking up in broken English and asking Adamowski if he would mind changing seats. He said with a nervous, forced smile that was meant to be ingratiating that Adamowski and the other gentleman, nodding at George, could talk more easily if they were opposite each other, and that for himself, he would be glad of the chance to look out the window. Adamowski answered indifferently, and with just a trace of the unconscious contempt with which a Polish nobleman might speak to someone in whom he felt no interest:  ""Yes, take my seat, of course.",1
5332,"It does not matter to me where I sit. They went out and walked forward through several coaches of the hurtling train, carefully squeezing past those passengers who, in Europe, seem to spend as much time standing in the narrow corridors and staring out of the windows as in their own seats, and who flatten themselves against the wall or obligingly step back into the doors of compartments as one passes. Finally they reached the Speisewagen, skirted the hot breath of the kitchen, and seated themselves at a table in the beautiful, bright, clean coach of the Mitropa service.",1
5333,"Adamowski ordered brandy lavishly. He seemed to have a Polish gentleman's liberal capacity for drink. He tossed his glass off at a single gulp, remarking rather plaintively:  ""It is very small.",1
5334,"But it is good and does no harm. We shall have mote.""  Pleasantly warmed by brandy, and talking together with the ease and confidence of people who had known each other for many years--for, indeed, the circumstances of their meeting and the discovery of their many common friends did give them just that feeling of old intimacy--they now began to discuss the three strangers in their compartment. The little woman--she is rather nice,"" said Adamowski, in a tone which somehow conveyed the impression that he was no novice in such appraisals. I think she is not very young, and yet, quite charming, isn't she? A personality. And the young man with her?",1
5335,"George inquired. What do you make of him? You don't think he is her husband?""  ""No, of course not,"" replied Adamowski instantly.",1
5336,"It is most curious,"" he went on in a puzzled tone. He is much younger, obviously, and not the same--he is much simpler than the lady. Yes.",1
5337,"It's almost as if he were a young fellow from the country, and she----""  ""Is like someone in the theatre,"" Adamowski nodded. An actress. Or perhaps some music-hall performer. Yes, exactly.",1
5338,"She is very nice, and yet I think she knows a great deal more than he does. I should like to know about them,"" Adamowski went on speculatively, in the manner of a man who has a genuine interest in the world about him. These people that one meets on trains and ships--they fascinate me. You see some strange things. And these two--they interest me. I should like so much to know who they are. And the other man?",1
5339,"George said. The little one? The nervous, fidgety fellow who keeps staring at us--who do you suppose he is?""  ""Oh, that one,"" said Adamowski indifferently, impatiently.",1
5340,"I do not know. I do not care. He is some stuffy little man--it doesn't matter... But shall we go back now?"" he said. Let's talk to them and see if we can find out who they are. We shall never see them again after this. I like to talk to people in trains. George agreed.",1
5341,"So his Polish friend called the waiter, asked for the bill, and paid it--and still had ten or twelve marks left of his waning twenty-three. Then they got up and went back through the speeding train to their compartment. 42. The Family of Earth The woman smiled at them as they came in, and all three of their 1 fellow-passengers looked at them in a way that showed wakened curiosity and increased interest. It was evident that George and Adamowski had themselves been subjects of speculation during their absence.",1
5342,"Adamowski now spoke to the others. His German was not very good but it was coherent, and his deficiencies did not bother him at all. He was so self-assured, so confirmed in his self-possession, that he could plunge boldly into conversation in a foreign language with no sense whatever of personal handicap. Thus encouraged, the three Germans now gave free expression to their curiosity, to the speculations which the meeting of George and Adamowski and their apparent recognition of each other had aroused.",1
5343,"The woman asked Adamowski where he came from--""Was fur ein Landsmann sind sie? He replied that he was an American. Ach, so? She looked surprised, then added quickly: ""But not by birth? You were not born in America? No,"" said Adamowski.",1
5344,"I am Polish by birth. But I live in America now. And my friend here""--they all turned to stare curiously at George---""is an American by birth. They nodded in satisfaction.",1
5345,"And the woman, smiling with good-humoured and eager interest, said:  ""And your friend--he is an artist, isn't he?""  ""Yes,"" said Adamowski. A painter? The woman's tone was almost gleeful as she pursued further confirmation of her own predictions.",1
5346,"He is not a painter. He is ein Dichter. The word means ""poet"", and George quickly amended it to ""ein Schriftsteller""--a writer.",1
5347,"All three of them thereupon looked at one another with nods of satisfaction, saying, ah, they thought so, it was evident. Old Fussand-Fidget even spoke up now, making the sage observation that it was apparent ""from the head"". The others nodded again, and the woman then turned once more to Adamowski, saying:  ""But you--you are not an artist, are you?",1
5348,"You do something else?""  He replied that he was a business man--""ein Geschäftsmann""--that he lived in New York, and that his business was in Wall Street. The name apparently had imposing connotations for them, for they all nodded in an impressed manner and said ""Ali! again.",1
5349,"George and Adamowski went on then and told them of the manner of their meeting, how they had never seen each other before that morning, but how each of them had known of the other through many mutual friends. This news delighted everyone. It was a complete confirmation of what they had themselves inferred. The little blonde lady nodded triumphantly and burst out in excited conversation with her companion and with Fuss-and-Fidget, saying:  ""What did I tell you?",1
5350,"I said the same thing, didn't I? It's a small world after all, isn't it?""  Now they were all really wonderfully at ease with one another, all talking eagerly, excitedly, naturally, like old friends who had just met after a long separation. The little lady began to tell them all about herself. She and her husband, she said, were proprietors of a business near the Alexander-platz. No--smiling--the young man was not her husband. He, too, was a young artist, and was employed by her. In what sort of business? She laughed--one would never guess. She and her husband manufactured manikins for show-window displays. No, it was not a shop, exactly--there was a trace of modest pride here--it was more like a little factory. They made their own figures. Their business, she implied, was quite a large one. She said that they employed over fifty workers, and formerly had had almost a hundred. That was why she had to go to Paris as often as she could, for Paris set the fashion in manikins just as it did in clothes.",1
5351,"Of course, they did not buy the Paris models. Mein Gott!--that was impossible with the money situation what it was. Nowadays it was hard enough for a German business person even to get out of his own country, much less to buy anything abroad. Nevertheless, hard as it was, she had to get to Paris somehow once or twice a year, just in order to keep up with ""what was going on. She always took an artist with her, and this young man was making his first trip in this capacity. He was a sculptor by profession, but he earned money for his art by doing commercial work in her business. He would make designs and draw models of the latest show-window manikins in Paris, and would duplicate them when he returned; then the factory would turn them out by the hundreds.",1
5352,"Adamowski remarked that he did not see how it was possible, under present circumstances, for a German citizen to travel anywhere. It had become difficult enough for a foreigner to get in and out of Germany. The money complications were so confusing and so wearisome.",1
5353,"George added to this an account of the complications that had attended his own brief journey to the Austrian Tyrol. Ruefully he displayed the pocketful of papers, permits, visas, and official stamps which he had accumulated during the summer. Upon this common grievance they were all vociferously agreed. The lady affirmed that it was stupid, exhausting, and, for a German with business outside the country, almost impossible. She added quickly, loyally, that of course it was also necessary. But then she went on to relate that her three-or four-day trips to Paris could only be managed through some complicated trade arrangement and business connection in France, and as she tried to explain the necessary details of the plan she became so involved in the bewildering complexities of cheques and balances that she finally ended by waving her hand charmingly in a gesture of exhausted dismissal, saying:  ""Ach, Gott!",1
5354,"It is all too complicated, too confusing! I cannot tell you how it is--I do not understand it myself!""  Old Fuss-and-Fidget put in here with confirmations of his own. He was, he said, an attorney in Berlin--""ein Rechtsanwalt""--and had formerly had extensive professional connections in France and in other portions of the Continent. He had visited America as well, and had been there as recently as 1930, when he had attended an international congress of lawyers in New York. He even spoke a little English, which he unveiled with evident pride. And he was going now, he said, to another international congress of lawyers which was to open in Paris the next day, and which would last a week. But even so brief a trip as this now had its serious difficulties. As for his former professional activities in other countries, they were now, alas, impossible.",1
5355,"He asked George if any of his books had been translated and published in Germany, and George told him they had. The others were all eagerly and warmly curious, wanting to know the titles and George's name. Accordingly, he wrote out for them the German titles of the books, the name of the German publisher, and his own name. They all looked interested and pleased. The little lady put the paper away in her pocket-book and announced enthusiastically that she would buy the books on her return to Germany. Fuss-and-Fidget, after carefully copying the paper, folded the memorandum and tucked it in his wallet, saying that he, too, would buy the books as soon as he came home again.",1
5356,"The lady's young companion, who had shyly and diffidently, but with growing confidence, joined in the conversation from time to time, now took from an envelope in his pocket several postcard photographs of sculptures he had made. They were pictures of muscular athletes, runners, wrestlers, miners stripped to the waist, and the voluptuous figures of young nude girls. These photographs were passed round, inspected by each of them, and praised and admired for various qualities.",1
5357,"Adamowski now picked up his bulky paper package, explained that it was filled with good things from his brother's estate in Poland, opened it, and invited everyone to partake. There were some splendid pears and peaches, some fine bunches of grapes, a plump broiled chicken, some fat squabs and partridges, and various other delicacies. The three Germans protested that they could not deprive him of his lunch. But Adamowski insisted vigorously, with the warmth of generous hospitality that was obviously characteristic of his nature. On the spur of the moment he reversed an earlier decision and informed them that he and George were going to the dining-car for luncheon anyway, and that if they did not eat the food in the package it would go to waste. On this condition they all helped themselves to fruit, which they pronounced delicious, and the lady promised that she would later investigate the chicken.",1
5358,"At length, with friendly greetings all round, George and his  Polish friend departed a second time and went forward to the Speisewagen. They had a long and sumptuous meal. It began with brandy, proceeded over a fine bottle of Bernkasteler, and wound up over coffee and more brandy. They were both determined to spend the remainder of their German money--Adamowski his ten or twelve marks, George his five or six--and this gave them a comfortable feeling in which astute economy was thriftily combined with good living.",1
5359,"During the meal they discussed their companions again. They were delighted with them and immensely interested in the information they had gathered from them. The woman, they both agreed, was altogether charming. And the young man, although diffident and shy, was very nice. They even had a word of praise for old Fussand-Fidget now. After his crusty shell had been cracked, the old codger was not bad. He really was quite friendly underneath.",1
5360,"And it goes to show,"" said Adamowski quietly, ""how good people really are, how easy it is to get along with one another in this world, how people really like each other--if only----""  ""--if only----"" George said, and nodded. --if only it weren't for these God-damned politicians,"" Adamowski concluded. At the end they called for their bill. Adamowski dumped his marks upon the table and counted them.",1
5361,"You'll have to help me out,"" he said. How many have you got?""  George dumped his out. Together, they had enough to pay the bill and to give the waiter something extra. And there was also enough left over for another double jolt of brandy and a good cigar.",1
5362,"So, grinning with satisfaction, in which their waiter joined amiably as he read their purpose, they paid the bill, ordered the brandy and cigars, and, full of food, drink, and the pleasant knowledge of a job well done, they puffed contentedly on their cigars and observed the landscape. They were now running through the great industrial region of western Germany. The pleasant landscape was gone, and everything in sight had been darkened by the grime and smoke of enormous works. The earth was dotted with the steely skeletons of great smelting and refining plants, and disfigured with mountainous dumps and heaps of slag. It was brutal, smoky, dense with life and labour and the grim warrens of industrial towns. But these places, too, had a certain fascination--the thrill of power in the raw.",1
5363,"The two friends talked about the scene and about their trip. Adamowski said they had done well to spend their German money. Outside of the Reich its exchange value would be lower, and they were already almost at the border; since their own coach went directly through to Paris, they would have no additional need of German currency for porters' fees.",1
5364,"George confided to him, somewhat apprehensively, that he had some thirty dollars in American currency for which he had no German permit. Almost all of his last week in Berlin had been consumed, he said, in the red tape of departure--pounding wearily from one steamship office to another in an effort to secure passage home, cabling to Fox Edwards for more money, then getting permits for the money. At the last moment he had discovered that he still had thirty dollars left for which he had no official permit. When he had gone in desperation to an acquaintance who was an official in a travel agency, and had asked him what to do, this man had told him wearily to put the money in his pocket and say nothing; that if he tried now to get a permit for it and waited for the authorities to act on it, he would miss the boat; so to take the chance, which was, at most, he thought, a very slight one, and go ahead.",1
5365,"Adamowski nodded in agreement, but suggested that George take the uncertified money, thrust it in the pocket of his vest, where he would not seem to hide it, and then, if he were discovered and questioned, he could say that he had put the money there and had forgotten to declare it. This he decided to do, and made the transfer then and there. This conversation brought them back to the thorny problem of the money regulations and the difficulties of their fellow-travellers who were Germans. They agreed that the situation was hard on their new-found friends, and that the law which permitted foreigners and citizens alike to take only ten marks from the country, unless otherwise allowed, was, for people in the business circumstances of the little blonde woman and old Fuss-and-Fidget, very unfair indeed.",1
5366,"Then Adamowski had a brilliant inspiration, the fruit of his generous and spontaneous impulses. But why----"" he said--""why can't we help them?""  ""How do you mean? In what way can we help them?""  ""Why,"" he said, ""I have here a permit that allows me to take twenty-three marks out of the country.",1
5367,"You have no permit, but everyone is allowed----""  ""--to take ten marks,"" George said. So you mean, then,"" he concluded, ""that each of us has spent his German money----""  ""--but can still take as much as is allowed out of the country. Yes,"" he said. So we could at least suggest it to them. You mean that they should give us some of their marks to keep in our possession until we get across the frontier?""  Adamowski nodded.",1
5368,"Yes. I could take twenty-three. You could take ten. It is not much, of course, but it might help. No sooner said than seized upon.",1
5369,"They were almost jubilantly elated at this opportunity to do some slight service for these people to whom they had taken such, a liking. But even as they sat there smiling confirmation at each other, a man in uniform came through the car, paused at their table--which was the only one now occupied, all the other diners having departed--and authoritatively informed them that the Pass-Control had come aboard the train, and that they must return at once to their compartment to await examination. They got up immediately and hastened back through the swaying coaches. George led the way, and Adamowski whispered at his shoulder that they must now make haste and propose their offer to their companions quickly, or it would be too late.",1
5370,"As soon as they entered the compartment they told their three German friends that the officials were already on the train and that the inspection would begin shortly. This announcement caused a flurry of excitement. They all began to get ready. The woman busied herself with her purse. She took out her passport, and then, with a worried look, began to count her money.",1
5371,"Adamowski, after watching her quietly for a moment, took out his certificate and held it open in his hand, remarking that he was officially allowed twenty-three marks, that he had had that sum at the beginning, but that now he had spent it. George took this as his cue and said that he, too, had spent all of his German money, and that, although he had no permit, he was allowed ten marks. The woman looked quickly, eagerly, from one to the other and read the friendship of their purpose.",1
5372,"Then you mean----"" she began. But it would be wonderful, of course, if you would!""  ""Have you as much as twenty-three marks above what you are allowed?"" asked Adamowski. Yes,"" she nodded quickly, with a worried look. I have more than that. But if you would take the twenty-three and keep them till we are past the frontier----""  He stretched out his hand.",1
5373,"Give them to me,"" he said. She gave them to him instantly, and the money was in his pocket in the wink of an eye. Fuss-and-Fidget now counted out ten marks nervously, and without a word passed them across to George. George thrust the money in his pocket, and they all sat back, a little flushed, excited but triumphant, trying to look composed.",1
5374,"A few minutes later an official opened the door of the compartment, saluted, and asked for their passports. He inspected Adamowski's first, found everything in order, took his certificate, saw his twenty-three marks, stamped the passport, and returned it to him. Then he turned to George, who gave him his passport and the various papers certifying his possession of American currency. The official thumbed through the pages of the passport, which were now almost completely covered with the stamps and entries which had been made every time George cashed a cheque for register-marks. On one page the man paused and frowned, scrutinising carefully a stamp showing re-entrance into Germany from Kufstein, on the Austrian border; then he consulted again the papers George had handed him. He shook his head. Where, he asked, was the certificate from Kufstein?  George's heart jumped and pounded hard.",1
5375,"He had forgotten the Kufstein certificate! There had been so many papers and documents of one kind and another since then that he no longer thought the Kufstein certificate was needed. He began to paw and thumb through the mass of papers that remained in his pocket. The officer waited patiently, but with an air of perturbation in his manner. Everyone else looked at George apprehensively, except Adamowski, who said quietly:  ""Just take your time.",1
5376,"It ought to be there somewhere. At last George found it! And as he did, his own sharp intake of relief found echo among his companions. As for the official, he, too, seemed glad. He smiled quite kindly, took the paper and inspected it, and returned the passport.",1
5377,"Meanwhile, during the anxious minutes that George had taken to paw through his papers, the official had already inspected the passports of the woman, her companion, and Fuss-and-Fidget. Everything was apparently in order with them, save that the lady had confessed to the possession of forty-two marks, and the official had regretfully informed her that he would have to take from her everything in excess of ten. The money would be held at the frontier and restored to her, of course, when she returned. She smiled ruefully, shrugged her shoulders, and gave the man thirty-two marks. All other matters were now evidently in order, for the man saluted and withdrew.",1
5378,"So it was over, then! They all drew deep breaths of relief, and commiserated the charming lady upon her loss. But they were all quietly jubilant, too, to know that her loss had been no greater, and that Adamowski had been able in some degree to lessen it.",1
5379,"George asked Fuss-and-Fidget if he wanted his money returned now or later. He replied that he thought it would be better to wait until they had crossed the frontier into Belgium. At the same time he made a casual remark, to which none of them paid any serious attention just then, to the effect that for some reason, which they did not follow, his ticket was good only to the frontier, and that he would utilise the fifteen minutes' wait at Aachen, which was the frontier town, to buy a ticket for the remainder of the trip to Paris.",1
5380,"They were now approaching Aachen. The train was beginning to slacken speed. They were going once more through a lovely countryside, smiling with green fields and gentle hills, unobtrusively, mildly, somehow unmistakably European. The seared and blasted district of the mines and factories was behind them. They were entering the outskirts of a pleasant town.",1
5381,"This was Aachen. Within a few minutes more, the train was slowing to a halt before the station. They had reached the frontier. Here there would be a change of engines. All of them got out--Fuss-and-Fidget evidently to get a ticket, the others to stretch their legs and get a breath of air.",1
5382,"43. The Capture Adamowski and George stepped out on the platform together and walked forward to inspect the locomotive. The German engine, which had here reached the end of its journey and would soon be supplanted by its Belgian successor, was a magnificent machine of tremendous power and weight, almost as big as one of the great American engines. It was beautifully streamlined for high velocity, and its tender was a wonderful affair, different from any other that George had ever seen. It seemed to be a honeycomb of pipes. One looked in through some slanting bars and saw a fountainlike display composed of thousands of tiny little jets of steaming water. Every line of this intricate and marvellous apparatus bore evidence of the organising skill and engineering genius that had created it.",1
5383,"Knowing how important are the hairline moments of transition, how vivid, swift, and fugitive are the poignant first impressions when a traveller changes from one country to another, from one people to another, from one standard of conduct and activity to another, George waited with intense interest for the approach of the Belgian locomotive in order to see what it might indicate of the differences between the powerful, solid, and indomitable race they were leaving and the little people whose country they were now about to enter. While Adamowski and George were engaged in observations and speculations on this subject, their own coach and another, which was also destined for Paris, were detached from the German train and shifted to a string of coaches on the opposite side of the platform. They were about to hasten back when a guard informed them that they still had ample time, and that the train was not scheduled to depart for another five minutes. So they waited a little longer, and Adamowski remarked that it was a pitiful evidence of the state Europe was in that a crack train between the two greatest cities on the Continent should be carrying only two through coaches, and these not even filled.",1
5384,"But the Belgian locomotive still did not come, and now, glancing up at the station clock, they saw that the moment for departure had arrived. Fearful of being left behind if they waited any longer, they started back along the platform. They found the little blonde-haired lady and, flanking her on each side, they hastened towards their coach and their own compartment.",1
5385,"As they approached, it was evident that something had happened. There were no signs of departure. The conductor and the station guard stood together on the platform. No warning signal had been given. When they came alongside of their car, people were clustered in the corridor, and something in the way they stood indicated a subdued tension, a sense of crisis, that made George's pulse beat quicker.",1
5386,"George had observed this same phenomenon several times before in the course of his life and he knew the signs. A man has leaped or fallen, for example, from a high building to the pavement of a city street; or a man has been shot or struck by a motor-car, and now lies dying quietly before the eyes of other men--and always the manifestation of the crowd is just the same. Even before you see the faces of the people, something about their backs, their posture, the position of their heads and shoulders tells you what has happened. You do not know, of course, the precise circumstances, but you sense immediately the final stage of tragedy. You know that someone has just died or is dying. And in the terrible eloquence of backs and shoulders, the feeding silence of the watching men, you also sense another tragedy which 'is even deeper. This is the tragedy of man's cruelty and his lust for pain--the tragic weakness which corrupts him, which he loathes, but which he cannot cure. As a child, George had seen it on the faces of men standing before the window of a shabby little undertaker's place, looking at the bloody, riddled carcass of a negro which the mob had caught and killed. Again, as a boy of fourteen, he had seen it on the faces of men and women at a dance, as they watched a fight in which one man beat another man to death.",1
5387,"And now, here it was again. As George and his two companions hastened along beside the train and saw the people gathered in the corridor in that same feeding posture, waiting, watching, in that same deadly fascinated silence, he was sure that once again he was about to witness death. That was the first thought that came to him--and it came also, instantaneously, without a word of communication between them, to Adamowski and the little blonde woman--the thought that someone had died. But as they started to get on the train, what suddenly stunned them and stopped them short, appalled, was the realisation that the tragedy, whatever it was, had happened in their own compartment. The shades were tightly drawn, the door closed and locked, the whole place sealed impenetrably. They stared in silence, rooted to the platform. Then they saw the woman's young companion standing at the window in the corridor. He motioned to them quickly, stealthily, a gesture warning them to remain where they were. And as he did so it flashed over all three of them that the victim of this tragic visitation must be the nervous little man who had been the companion of their voyage since morning. The stillness of the scene and the shuttered blankness of that closed compartment were horrible. They all felt sure that this little man who had begun by being so disagreeable, but who had gradually come out of his shell and become their friend, and to whom they had all been talking only fifteen minutes before, had died, and that authority and the law were now enclosed there with his body in the official ceremony that society demands.",1
5388,"Even as they stared appalled and horror-stricken at that fatally curtained compartment, the lock clicked sharply, the door was opened and closed quickly, and an official came out. He was a burly fellow in a visored cap and a jacket of olive green--a man of forty-five or more with high, blunt cheek-bones, a florid face, and tawny moustaches combed out sprouting in the Kaiser Wilhelm way. His head was shaven, and there were thick creases at the base of his skull and across his fleshy neck. He came out, climbed down clumsily to the platform, signalled and called excitedly to another officer, and climbed back into the train again.",1
5389,"He belonged to a familiar and well-known type, one which George had seen and smiled at often, but one which now became, under these ominous and unknown circumstances, sinisterly unpleasant. The man's very weight and clumsiness, the awkward way he got down from the train and climbed up again, the thickness of his waist, the width and coarseness of his lumbering buttocks, the way his sprouting moustaches quivered with passion and authority, the sound of his guttural voice as he shouted to his fellow-officer, his puffing, panting air of official indignation--all these symptoms which ran true to type now became somehow loathsome and repellent. All of a sudden, without knowing why, George felt himself trembling with a murderous and incomprehensible anger. He wanted to smash that fat neck with the creases in it. He wanted to pound that inflamed and blunted face into a jelly. He wanted to kick square and hard, bury his foot dead centre in the obscene fleshiness of those lumbering buttocks. Like all Americans, he had never liked the police and the kind of personal authority that is sanctified in them. But his present feeling, with its murderous rage, was a good deal more than that. For he knew that he was helpless, that all of them were, and he felt impotent, shackled, unable to stir against the walls of an unreasonable but unshakable authority.",1
5390,"The official with the sprouting moustaches, accompanied by the colleague he had summoned, opened the curtained door of the compartment again, and now George saw that two other officers were inside. And the nervous little man who had been their companion--no, he was not dead!--he sat all huddled up, facing them. His face was white and pasty. It looked greasy, as if it were covered with a salve of cold, fat sweat. Under his long nose his mouth was trembling in a horrible attempt at a smile. And in the very posture of the two men as they bent over him and questioned him there was something revolting and unclean.",1
5391,"But the official with the thick, creased neck had now filled the door and blotted out the picture. He went in quickly, followed by his colleague. The door closed behind them, and again there was nothing but the drawn curtains and that ill-omened secrecy.",1
5392,"All the people who had gathered round had got this momentary glimpse and had simply looked on with stupefied surprise. Now those who stood in the corridor of the train began to whisper to one another. The little blonde woman went over and carried on a whispered conversation with the young man and several other people who were standing at the open window. After conferring with them with subdued but growing excitement for a minute or two, she came back, took George and Adamowski by the arm, and whispered:  ""Come over here.",1
5393,"There is something I want to tell you. She led them across the platform, out of hearing. Then, as both of the men said in lowered voices: ""What is it?""--she looked round cautiously and whispered:  ""That man--the one in our compartment--he was trying to get out of the country--and they've caught him!",1
5394,"But why? What for? What has he done?"" they asked, bewildered.",1
5395,"Again she glanced back cautiously and, drawing them together till their three heads were almost touching, she said in a secretive whisper that was full of awe and fright:  ""They say he is a Jew! And they found money on him! They searched him--they searched his baggage--he was taking money out!""  ""How much?"" asked Adamowski.",1
5396,"I don't know,"" she whispered. A great deal, I think. A hundred thousand marks, some say. Anyhow, they found it!",1
5397,"But how? George began. I thought everything was finished. I thought they were done with all of us when they went through the train. Yes,"" she said.",1
5398,"But don't you remember something about the ticket? He said something about not having a ticket the whole way. I suppose he thought it would be safer--wouldn't arouse suspicion in Berlin if he bought a ticket only to Aachen. So he got off the train here to buy his ticket for Paris--and that's when they caught him! she whispered. They must had have their eye on him! They must have suspected him! That's why they didn't question him when they came through the train! George remembered now that ""they"" had not. But they were watching for him, and they caught him here! she went on. They asked him where he was going, and he said to Paris. They asked him how much money he was taking out. He said ten marks. Then they asked him how long he was going to remain in Paris, and for what purpose, and he said he was going to be there a week, attending this congress of lawyers that he spoke about. They asked him, then, how he proposed to stay in Paris a week if all he had was ten marks. And I think,"" she whispered, ""that that's where he got frightened! He began to lose his head! He said he had twenty marks besides, which he had put into another pocket and forgotten. And then, of course, they had him! They searched him! They searched his baggage! And they found more""--she whispered in an awed tone--""much, much more!",1
5399,"They all stared at one another, too stunned to say a word. Then the woman laughed in a low, frightened sort of way, a little, uncertain: ""O-hoh-hoh-hoh-hoh,"" ending on a note of incredulity. This man""--she whispered again--""this little Jew----"".",1
5400,"I didn't know he was a Jew,"" George said. I should not have thought so. But he is!",1
5401,"she whispered, and looked stealthily round again to see if they were being overheard or watched. And he was doing what so many of the others have done--he was trying to get out with his money! Again she laughed, the uncertain little ""Hohhoh-hoh"" that mounted to incredulous amazement. Yet George saw that her eyes were troubled, too.",1
5402,"All of a sudden George felt sick, empty, nauseated. Turning half away, he thrust his hands into his pockets--and drew them out as though his fingers had been burned. The man's money--he still had it! Deliberately, now, he put his hand into his pocket again and felt the five two-mark pieces. The coins seemed greasy, as if they were covered with sweat. George took them out and closed them in his fist and started across the platform towards the train. The woman seized him by the arm.",1
5403,"Where are you going?"" she gasped. What are you going to do?""  ""I'm going to give the man his money. I won't see him again. I can't keep it. Her face went white.",1
5404,"Are you mad?"" she whispered. Don't you know that that will do no good? You'll only get yourself arrested! And, as for him--he's in trouble enough already. You'll only make it so much worse for him. And besides,"" she faltered, ""God knows what he has done, what he has said already. If he has lost his head completely--if he has told that we have transferred money to one another--we'll all be in for it!""  They had not thought of this.",1
5405,"And as they realised the possible consequences of their good intentions, they just stood there, all three, and stared helplessly at one another. They just stood there, feeling dazed and weak and hollow. They just stood there and prayed.",1
5406,"And now the officers were coming out of the compartment. The curtained door opened again, and the fellow with the sprouting moustaches emerged, carrying the little man's valise. He clambered down clumsily onto the platform and set the valise on the floor between his feet. He looked round. It seemed to George and the others that he glared at them. They just stood still and hardly dared to breathe. They thought they were in for it, and expected now to see all of their own baggage come out.",1
5407,"But in a moment the other three officials came through the door of the compartment with the little man between them. They stepped down to the platform and marched him along, white as a sheet, grease standing out in beads all over his face, protesting volubly in a voice that had a kind of anguished lilt in it. He came right by the others as they stood there. The man's money sweated in George's hand, and he did not know what to do. He made a movement with his arm and started to speak to him. At the same time he was hoping desperately that the man would not speak. George tried to look away from him, but could not. The little man came towards them, protesting with every breath that the whole thing could be explained, that it was an absurd mistake. For just the flick of an instant as he passed the others he stopped talking, glanced at them, white-faced, still smiling his horrible little forced smile of terror; for just a moment his eyes rested on them, and then, without a sign of recognition, without betraying them, without giving any indication that he knew them, he went on by.",1
5408,"George heard the woman at his side sigh faintly and felt her body slump against him. They all felt weak, drained of their last energies. Then they walked slowly across the platform and got into the train.",1
5409,"The evil tension had been snapped now. People were talking feverishly, still in low tones but with obvious released excitement. The little blonde woman leaned from the window of the corridor and spoke to the fellow with the sprouting moustaches, who was still standing there.",1
5410,"You--you're not going to let him go?"" she asked hesitantly, almost in a whisper. Are--are you going to keep him here? He looked at her stolidly.",1
5411,"Then a slow, intolerable smile broke across his brutal features. He nodded his head deliberately, with the finality of a gluttonous and full-fed satisfaction:  ""Ja,"" he said. Er bleibt. And, shaking his head ever so slightly from side to side: ""Geht nicht! he said.",1
5412,"They had him. Far down the platform the passengers heard the shrill, sudden fife of the Belgian engine whistle. The guard cried warning. All up and down the train the doors were slammed. Slowly the train began to move. At a creeping pace it rolled right past the little man. They had him, all right. The officers surrounded him. He stood among them, still protesting, talking with his hands now. And the men in uniform said nothing. They had no need to speak. They had him. They just stood and watched him, each with a faint suggestion of that intolerable slow smile upon his face. They raised their eyes and looked at the passengers as the train rolled past, and the line of travellers standing in the corridors looked back at them and caught the obscene and insolent communication in their glance and in that intolerable slow smile.",1
5413,"And the little man--he, too, paused once from his feverish effort to explain. As the car in which he had been riding slid by, he lifted his pasty face and terror-stricken eyes, and for a moment his lips were stilled of their anxious pleading. He looked once, directly and steadfastly, at his former companions, and they at him. And in that gaze there was all the unmeasured weight of man's mortal anguish. George and the others felt somehow naked and ashamed, and somehow guilty. They all felt that they were saying farewell, not to a man, but to humanity; not to some pathetic stranger, some chance acquaintance of the voyage, but to mankind; not to some nameless cipher out of life, but to the fading image of a brother's face.",1
5414,"The train swept out and gathered speed--and so they lost him:  44. The Way of no Return ""Well,"" said Adamowski, turning to George, ""I think this is a sad end to our journey. George nodded but said nothing.",1
5415,"Then they all went back into their compartment and took their former seats. But it seemed strange and empty now. The ghost of absence sat there ruinously. The little man had left his coat and hat; in his anguish he had forgotten them. Adamowski rose and took them; and would have given them to the conductor, but the woman said:  ""You'd better look into the pockets first.",1
5416,"There may be something in them. Perhaps""--quickly, eagerly, as the idea took her--""perhaps he has left money there,"" she whispered. Adamowski searched the pockets. There was nothing of any value in them. He shook his head. The woman began to search the cushions of the seats, thrusting her hands down around the sides.",1
5417,"It might just be, you know,"" she said, ""that he hid money here. She laughed excitedly, almost gleefully. Perhaps we'll all be rich!",1
5418,"The young Pole shook his head. I think they would have found it if he had. He paused, peered out of the window, and thrust his his hand into his pocket. I suppose we're in Belgium now,"" he said. Here's your money. And he returned to her the twenty-three marks she had given him.",1
5419,"She took the money and put it in her purse. George still had the little man's ten marks in his hand and was looking at them. The woman glanced up, saw his face, then said quickly, warmly: ""But you're upset about this thing! You look so troubled. George put the money away.",1
5420,"Then he said:  ""I feel exactly as if I had blood-money in my pocket. No,"" she said. She leaned over, smiling, and put her hand reassuringly upon his arm. Not blood-money--Jew-money! she whispered. Don't worry about it. He had plenty more! George's eyes met Adamowski's. Both were grave.",1
5421,"This is a sad ending to our trip,"" Adamowski said again, in a low voice, almost to himself. The woman tried to talk them out of their depression, to talk herself into forgetfulness. She made an effort to laugh and joke.",1
5422,"These Jews! she cried. Such things would never happen if it were not for them! They make all the trouble. Germany has had to protect herself. The Jews were taking all the money from the country. Thousands of them escaped, taking millions of marks with them. And now, when it's too late, we wake up to it! It's too bad that foreigners must see these things--that they've got to go through these painful experiences--it makes a bad impression. They don't understand the reason. But it's the Jews! she whispered.",1
5423,"The others said nothing, and the woman went on talking, eagerly, excitedly, earnestly, persuasively. But it was as if she were trying to convince herself, as if every instinct of race and loyalty were now being used in an effort to excuse or justify something that had filled her with sorrow and deep shame. For even as she talked and laughed, her clear blue eyes were sad and full of trouble. And at length she gave it up and stopped. There was a heavy silence. Then, gravely, quietly, the woman said:  ""He must have wanted very badly to escape.""  They remembered, then, all that he had said and done throughout the journey.",1
5424,"They recalled how nervous he had been, how he had kept opening and shutting the door, how he had kept getting up to pace along the corridor. They spoke of the suspicion and distrust with which he had peered round at them when he first came in, and of the eagerness with which he had asked Adamowski to change places with him when the Pole had got up to go into the dining-car with George. They recalled his explanations about the ticket, about having to buy passage from the frontier to Paris. All of these things, every act and word and gesture of the little man, which they had dismissed at the time as trivial or as evidence simply of an irascible temper, now became invested with a new and terrible meaning.",1
5425,"But the ten marks! the woman cried at length, turning to George. Since he had all this other money, why, in God's name, did he give ten marks to you? It was so stupid! she exclaimed in an exasperated tone. There was no reason for it!",1
5426,"Certainly they could find no reason, unless he had done it to divert suspicion from their minds about his true intent. This was Adamowski's theory, and it seemed to satisfy the woman. But George thought it more likely that the little man was in such a desperate state of nervous frenzy and apprehension that he had lost the power to reason clearly and had acted blindly, wildly, on the impulse of the moment. But they did not know. And now they would never find out the answer.",1
5427,"George was still worried about getting the man's ten marks returned to him. The woman said that she had given the man her name and her address in Paris, and that if he were later allowed to complete his journey he could find her there. George then gave her his own address in Paris and asked her to inform the man where he was if she should hear from him. She promised, but they all knew that she would never hear from him again.",1
5428,"Late afternoon had come. The country had closed in around them. The train was winding through a pleasant, romantic landscape of hills and woods. In the slant of evening and the waning light there was a sense of deep, impenetrable forest and of cool, darkling waters.",1
5429,"They had long since passed the frontier, but the woman, who had been looking musingly and a little anxiously out of the window, hailed the conductor as he passed along the corridor and asked him if they were really in Belgium now. He assured her that they were. Adamowski gave him the little man's hat and coat, and explained the reason. The conductor nodded, took them, and departed.",1
5430,"The woman had her hand upon her breast, and now when the conductor had gone she sighed slowly with relief. Then, quietly and simply, she said:  ""Do not misunderstand me. I am a German and I love my country. But--I feel as if a weight has lifted from me here. She put her hand upon her breast again. You cannot understand, perhaps, just how it feels to us, but--"" and for a moment she was silent, as if painfully meditating what she wished to say. Then, quickly, quietly: ""We are so happy to be--out!""  Out?",1
5431,"Yes, that was it. Suddenly George knew just how she felt. He, too, was ""out"" who was a stranger to her land, and yet who never had been a stranger in it. He, too, was ""out"" of that great country whose image had been engraved upon his spirit in childhood and youth, before he had ever seen it. He, too, was ""out"" of that land which had been so much more to him than land, so much more than place. It had been a geography of heart's desire, an unfathomed domain of unknown inheritance. The haunting beauty of that magic land had been his soul's dark wonder. He had known the language of its spirit before he ever came to it, had understood the language of its tongue the moment he had heard it spoken. He had framed the accents of its speech most brokenly from that first hour, yet never with a moment's trouble, strangeness, or lack of comprehension. He bad been at home in it, and it in him. It seemed that he had been born with this knowledge.",1
5432,"He had known wonder in this land, truth and magic in it, sorrow, loneliness, and pain in it. He had known love in it, and for the first time in his life he had tasted there the bright, delusive sacraments of fame. Therefore it was no foreign land to him. It was the other part of his heart's home, a haunted part of dark desire, a magic domain of fulfilment. It was the dark, lost Helen that had been forever burning in his blood--the dark, lost Helen he had found.",1
5433,"And now it was the dark, found Helen he had lost. And he knew now, as he had never known before, the priceless measure of his loss. He knew also the priceless measure of his gain. For this was the way that henceforth would be forever closed to him--the way of no return. He was ""out"". And, being ""out"", he began to see another way, the way that lay before him. He saw now that you can't go home again--not ever. There was no road back. Ended now for him, with the sharp and clean finality of the closing of a door, was the time when his dark roots, like those of a pot-bound plant, could be left to feed upon their own substance and nourish their own little self-absorbed designs. Henceforth they must spread outward--away from the hidden, secret, and unfathomed past that holds man's spirit prisoner--outward, outward towards the rich and life-giving soil of a new freedom in the wide world of all humanity. And there came to him a vision of man's true home, beyond the ominous and cloud-engulfed horizon of the here and now, in the green and hopeful and still-virgin meadows of the future.",1
5434,"Therefore,"" he thought, ""old master, wizard Faust, old father of the ancient and swarm-haunted mind of man, old earth, old German land with all the measure of your truth, your glory, beauty, magic, and your ruin; and dark Helen burning in our blood, great queen and mistress, sorceress--dark land, dark land, old ancient earth I love--farewell!""  BOOK VII. - A WIND IS RISING, AND THE RIVERS FLOW The experiences of that final summer in Germany had a profound effect upon George Webber. He had come face to face with something old and genuinely evil in the spirit of man which he had never known before, and it shook his inner world to its foundations. Not that it produced a sudden revolution in his way of thinking. For years his conception of the world and of his own place in it had been gradually changing, and the German adventure merely brought this process to its climax. It threw into sharp relief many other related phenomena which George had observed in the whole temper of the times, and it made plain to him, once and for all, the dangers that lurk in those latent atavistic urges which man has inherited from his dark past.",1
5435,"Hitlerism, he saw, was a recrudescence of an old barbarism. Its racial nonsense and cruelty, its naked worship of brute force, its suppression of truth and resort to lies and myths, its ruthless contempt for the individual, its anti-intellectual and anti-moral dogma that to one man alone belongs the right of judgment and decision, and that for all others virtue lies in blind, unquestioning obedience--each of these fundamental elements of Hitlerism was a throwback to that fierce and ancient tribalism which had sent waves of hairy Teutons swooping down out of the north to destroy the vast edifice of Roman civilisation. That primitive spirit of greed and lust and force had always been the true enemy of mankind.",1
5436,"But this spirit was not confined to Germany. It belonged to no one race. It was a terrible part of the universal heritage of man. One saw traces of it everywhere. It took on many disguises, many labels. Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin--each had his own name for it. And America had it, too, in various forms. For wherever ruthless men conspired together for their own ends, wherever the rule of dog-eat-dog was dominant, there it bred. And wherever one found it, one also found that its roots sank down into something primitive in man's ugly past. And these roots would somehow have to be eradicated, George felt, if man was to win his ultimate freedom and not be plunged back into savagery and perish utterly from the earth.",1
5437,"When George realised all this he began to look for atavistic yearnings in himself. He found plenty of them. Any man can find them if he is honest enough to look for them. The whole year that followed his return from Germany, George occupied himself with this effort of self-appraisal. And at the end of it he knew, and with the knowledge came the definite sense of new direction towards which he had long been groping, that the dark ancestral cave, the womb from which mankind emerged into the light, forever pulls one back--but that you can* go home again.",1
5438,"[* The 1947 UK edition was used to make this ebook. In that edition the word ""can"" appears. In another edition the word ""can't"" appears. --ebook editor.] The phrase had many implications for, him. You can't go back home to your family, back home to your childhood, back home to romantic love, back home to a young man's dreams of glory and of fame, back home to exile, to escape to Europe and some foreign land, back home to lyricism, to singing just for singing's sake, back home to aestheticism, to one's youthful idea of ""the artist"" and the all-sufficiency of ""art"" and ""beauty"" and ""love"", back home to the ivory tower, back home to places in the country, to the cottage in Bermuda, away from all the strife and conflict of the world, back home to the father you have lost and have been looking for, back home to someone who can help you, save you, ease the burden for you, back home to the old forms and systems of things which once seemed everlasting but which are changing all the time--back home to the escapes of Time and Memory.",1
5439,"In a way, the phrase summed up everything he had ever learned. And what he now knew led inexorably to a decision which was the hardest he had ever bad to make. Throughout the year he wrestled with it, talked about it with his friend and editor, Foxhall Edwards, and fought against doing what he realised he would have to do. For the time had come to leave Fox Edwards. They bad reached a parting of the ways. Not that Fox was one of the new barbarians. God, no! But Fox--well, Fox--Fox understood. And George knew that whatever happened, Fox would always remain his friend.",1
5440,"So in the end, after all their years together, they parted. And when it was over, George sat down and wrote to Fox. He wanted to leave the record clear. And this is what he wrote:  45.",1
5441,"Young Icarus I have of late, dear Fox [George wrote], been thinking of you very I much, and of your strange but most familiar face. I never knew a man like you before, and if I had not known you, I never could have imagined you. And yet, to me you are inevitable, so that, having known you, I cannot imagine what life would have been for me without you. You were a polestar in my destiny. You were the magic thread in the great web which, being woven now, is finished and complete: the circle of our lives rounds out, full swing, and each of us in his own way now has rounded it: there is no further circle we can make. This, too--the end as the beginning--was inevitable: therefore, dear friend and parent of my youth, farewell.",1
5442,"Nine years have passed since first I waited in your vestibule. And I was not repulsed. No: I was taken in, was welcomed, was picked up and sustained just when my spirit reached its lowest ebb, was given life and hope, the restoration of my self-respect, the vindication of my self-belief, the renewal of my faith by the assurance of your own belief; and I was carried on, through all the struggle, doubt, confusion, desperation, effort of the years that were to follow, by your help and by the noble inspiration of your continued faith.",1
5443,"But now it ends--the road we were to go together. We two alone know how completely it has ended. But before I go, because few men can ever know, from first to last, a circle of such whole, superb finality, I leave this picture of it.",1
5444,"You may think it a little premature of me to start summing up my life at the age of thirty-seven. That is not my purpose here. But, although thirty-seven is not an advanced age at which one can speak of having learned many things, neither is it too early to have learned a few. By that time a man has lived long enough to be able to look back over the road he has come and see certain events and periods in a proportion and a perspective which he could not have had before. And because certain of the periods of my life represent to me, as I now look back on them, stages of marked change and development, not only in the spirit which animates the work I do, but also in my views on men and living, and my own relation to the world, I am going to tell you about them. Believe me, it is not egotism that prompts me to do this. As you will see, my whole experience swings round, as though through a pre-destined orbit, to you, to this moment, to this parting. So bear with me--and then, farewell.",1
5445,"To begin at the beginning (all is clear from start to finish):  Twenty years ago, when I was seventeen years old and a sophomore at Pink Rock College, I was very fond, along with many of my fellows, of talking about my ""philosophy of life"". That was one of our favourite subjects of conversation, and we were most earnest about it. I'm not sure now what my ""philosophy"" was at that time, but I am sure I had one. Everybody had. We were deep in philosophy at Pine Rock. We juggled such formidable terms as ""concepts"", ""categorical imperatives"", and ""moments of negation"" in a way that would have made Spinoza blush.",1
5446,"And if I do say so, I was no slouch at it myself. At the age of seventeen I had an A-1 rating as a philosopher. Concepts"" held no terrors for my young life, and ""moments of negation"" were my meat. I could split a hair with the best of them. And now that I have turned to boasting, I may as well tell you that I made a One in Logic, and it was said to be the only One that had been given in that course for many a year. So when it comes to speaking of philosophy, I am, you see, a fellow who is privileged to speak.",1
5447,"I don't know how it goes with students of this generation, but to those of us who were in college twenty years ago philosophy was serious business. We were always talking about ""God"". In our interminable discussions we were for ever trying to get at the inner essence of ""truth"", ""goodness"", and ""beauty"". We were full of notions about all these things. And I do not laugh at them to-day. We were young, we were impassioned, and we were sincere.",1
5448,"One of the most memorable events-of my college career occurred one day at noon when I was walking up a campus path and encountered, coming towards me, one of my classmates whose name was D. T. Jones. D. T.--sometimes known more familiarly as Delirium Tremens--was also a philosopher. And the moment I saw him approaching I knew that D. T. was in the throes. He came from a family of Primitive Baptists, and he was red-haired, gaunt, and angular, and now as he came towards me everything about him--hair, eyebrows, eyelids, eyes, freckles, even his large and bony hands--shone forth in the sunlight with an excessive and almost terrifying redness.",1
5449,"He was coming up from a noble wood in which we held initiations and took our Sunday strolls. It was also the sacred grove to which we resorted, alone, when we were struggling with the problems of philosophy. It was where we went when we were going through what was known as ""the wilderness experience"", and it was the place from which, when ""the wilderness experience"" was done, we triumphantly emerged.",1
5450,"D. T. was emerging now. He had been there, he told me later, all night long. His ""wilderness experience"" had been a good one. He came bounding towards me like a kangaroo, leaping into the air at intervals, and the only words he said were:  ""I've had a Concept!""  Then, leaving me stunned and leaning for support against an ancient tree, he passed on down the path, high-bounding every step or two, to carry the great news to the whole brotherhood.",1
5451,"And still I do not laugh at it. We took philosophy seriously in those days, and each of us had his own. And, together, we had our own ""Philosopher"". He was a venerable and noble-hearted man--one of those great figures which almost every college had some years ago, and which I hope they still have. For half a century he had been a dominant figure in the life of the entire state. In his teaching he was a Hegelian. The process of his scholastic reasoning was intricate: it came up out of ancient Greece and followed through the whole series of ""developments"" down to Hegel. After Hegel--well, he did not supply the answer. But it didn't matter, for after Hegel we had him--he was our own Old Man.",1
5452,"Our Philosopher's ""philosophy"", as I look back upon it, does not seem important now. It seems to have been, at best, a tortuous and patched-up scheme of other men's ideas. But what was important was the man himself. He was a great teacher, and what he did for us, and for others before us for fifty years, was not to give us his ""philosophy""--but to communicate to us his own alertness, his originality, his power to think. He was a vital force because he supplied to many of us, for the first time in our lives, the inspiration of a questioning intelligence. He taught us not to be afraid to think, to question; he taught us to examine critically the most sacrosanct of our native prejudices and superstitions. So of course, throughout the state, the bigots hated him; but his own students worshipped him to idolatry. And the seed he planted grew--long after Hegel, ""concepts"", ""moments of negation"", and all the rest of it had vanished into the limbo of forgotten things.",1
5453,"It was at about this time that I began to write. I was editor of the college newspaper, and I wrote stories and poems for our literary magazine, The Burr, of which I was also a member of the editorial staff. The war was going on then. I was too young to be in service, but my first literary attempts may be traced to the patriotic inspiration of the war. I remember one poem (my first, I believe) which was aimed directly at the luckless head of Kaiser Bill. It was called, defiantly: ""The Gauntlet"", and was written in the style and meter of ""The Present Crisis"", by James Russell Lowell. I remember, too, that it took a high note from the very beginning. The poet, it is said, is the prophet and the bard--the awakened tongue of all his folk. I was all of that. In the name of embattled democracy I let the Kaiser have the works. And I remember two lines in particular that seemed to me to ring out with the very voice of outraged Freedom:  ""Thou hast given us the challenge-- Pay, thou dog, the cost, and go!"" I remember these lines because they were the occasion of an editorial argument.",1
5454,"The more conservative members of the magazine's staff felt that the epithet, ""thou dog"", was too strong--not that the Kaiser didn't deserve it, but that it jarred rudely upon the high moral elevation of the poem and upon the literary quality of The Burr. Over my vigorous protest, and without regard for the meter of the line, the two words were deleted. Another poem that I wrote that year was a cheerful one about a peasant in a Flanders field who ploughed up a skull, and then went on quietly about his work while the great guns blasted away and ""the grinning skull its grisly secret kept"". I also remember a short story--my first--which was called ""A Winchester of Virginia"", and was about the recreant son of an old family who recovered his courage and vindicated his tarnished honour in the charge over the top that took his life. These, so far as I can recall them, were my first creative efforts; it will be seen what an important part the last war played in them.",1
5455,"I mention all this merely to fix the point from which I started. This was the beginning of the road. In recent years there have been several attempts to explain what has happened to me since that time in terms of something that happened to me in college. I believe, Fox, that I never told you about that episode. Not that I was ashamed of my part in it or was afraid to talk about it. It just never came up; in a way, I had forgotten it. But now, at this moment of our parting, I think I had better speak of it, because it is vitally important to me to make one thing clear: that I am not the victim or the embittered martyr of anything that ever happened in the past. Oh, yes, there was a time, as you well know, when I was full of bitterness. There was a time when I felt that life had betrayed me. But that preciousness is gone now, and with it has gone my bitterness. This is the simple truth.",1
5456,"But to get back to this episode I spoke of:  As you know, Fox, when my first book was published, feeling ran high against me at home. Then it was that an effort was made to explain what was called the ""bitterness"" of the book in terms of my disfranchisement when I was at college. Now, the Pine Rock case is famous in Old Catawba, but the names of its chief actors had been almost forgotten when the book appeared. Then, because I was one of them, people began to talk about the case again, and the whole horrible tragedy was exhumed.",1
5457,"It was recalled how five of us (and God have mercy on the souls of those others who kept silent at the time) had taken our classmate Bell out to the playing-field one night, blindfolded him, and compelled him to dance upon a barrel. It was recalled how he stumbled and toppled from the barrel, fell on a broken bottle-neck, severed his jugular, and bled to death within five minutes. It was recalled, then, how the five of us--myself and Randy Shepperton, John Brackett, Stowell Anderson, and Dick Carr--were expelled, brought up for trial, released in the custody of our parents or nearest relatives, and deprived of the rights of citizenship by legislative act.",1
5458,"All this was true. But the construction which people put upon it when the book appeared was false. None of us, I think, was ""ruined"" and ""embittered""--and our later records prove that we were not. There is no doubt that the tragic consequences of our act (and of the five who suffered disfranchisement, at least three--I will not say which three--were present only in the group of onlookers) left its dark and terrible imprint on our young lives. But, as Randy whispered to me on that dreadful night, as we stood there white-faced and helpless in the moonlight, watching that poor boy as he bled to death:  ""We're not guilty of anything--except of being plain damned fools!",1
5459,"That was the way we felt that night--all of us--as we knelt, sick with horror, around the figure of that dying boy. And I know that was the way Bell felt, too, for he saw the terror and remorse in our white faces and, dying though he was, he tried to smile and speak to us. The words would not come, but all of us knew that if he could have spoken he would have said that he was sorry for us--that he knew there was no evil in us--no evil but our own stupidity.",1
5460,"We had killed the boy--our thoughtless folly killed him--but with his dying breath that would have been his only judgment on us. And we broke the heart of Plato Grant, our Old Man, our own Philosopher; but all he said to us that night as he turned towards us from poor Bell was, quietly:  ""My God, boys, what have you done? And that was all. Even Bell's father said no more to us. And after the first storm had passed, the cry of outrage and indignation that went up throughout the state--that was our punishment: the knowledge of the Done inexorable, the merciless insistence in our souls of that fatal and irrevocable ""Why?""  Swiftly people came to see and feel this, too.",1
5461,"The first outburst of wrath that resulted in our disfranchisement was quickly over. Even out citizenship was quietly restored to us within three years. (As for myself, I was only eighteen when it happened, and cannot even be said to have missed a legal vote because of it.) Each of us was allowed to return to college the next year after our expulsion, and finish the full course. The sentiment of people everywhere not only softened: the verdict quickly became: ""They didn't mean to do it. They were just damned fools. Later, by the time of our re-enfranchisement, public sentiment actually became liberal in its tone of pardon. They've been punished enough,"" people said by then. They were just kids--and they didn't mean to do it. Besides""--this became an argument in our favour--""it cost a life, but it killed hazing in the state. As to the later record of the five--Randy Shepperton is dead now; but John Brackett, Stowell Anderson, and Dick Carr have all enjoyed a more than average measure of success in their communities.",1
5462,"When I last saw Stowell Anderson--he is an attorney, and the political leader of his district--he told me quietly that, far from having been damaged in his career by the experience, he thought he had been helped. People,"" he said, ""are willing to forget a past mistake if they see you're regular. They're not only willing to forgive--on the whole, I think they're even glad to give a helping hand. If they see you're regular!",1
5463,"Without commenting on the meanings of that, I think it sums up the matter in a nutshell. There has not only been no question since about the ""regularity"" of the other three--Brackett, Anderson, and Carr--but I think any natural tendencies they may have had towards regularity were intensified by their participation in the Pine Rock case. I believe, too, that the denunciations of my ""irregularity"", following the publication of my first book, might have been even more virulent and vicious than they were had it not been for the respectable fellowship of Brackett, Anderson, and Carr.",1
5464,"Well, Fox, I have taken the trouble to tell you about this unrecorded incident in my life because I thought you might hear of it some time and might possibly put a strained construction on it. There were those in Libya Hill who thought it offered a reasonable and complete explanation of what had happened to me when I wrote the book. So, too, you might come to believe that it twisted and embittered me and somehow had something to do with what has happened now. With nine-tenths of your mind and heart you understand perfectly why I have to leave you, but with that remaining tenth you are still puzzled, and I can see that you will go on wondering about it. You have, from time to time, tried to reason with me about what you called, half seriously, my ""radicalism"". I don't believe there is any radicalism in me--or, if there is, it is certainly not what the word implies when you use it.",1
5465,"So, believe me, the Pine Rock case has nothing to do with it. It explains nothing. Rather, the natural assumption, for me as for the others who were involved in it, would be that the experience should have established me in a more staunch and regular conformity than I should otherwise have known.",1
5466,"You have a friend, Fox, named Hunt Conroy. You introduced me to him. He is only a few years my senior, but he is very fixed in his assertion of what he calls ""The Lost Generation""--a generation of which, as you know, he has been quite vociferously a member, and in which he has tried enthusiastically to include me. Hunt and I used to argue about it.",1
5467,"You belong to it, too,"" he used to say grimly. You came along at the same time. You can't get away from it. You're a part of it whether you want to be or not. To which my vulgar response was:  ""Don't you-hoo me!",1
5468,"If Hunt wants to belong to The Lost Generation--and it really is astonishing with what fond eagerness some people hug the ghost of desolation to their breast--that's his affair. But he can't have me. If I have been elected, it was against my knowledge and my will--and I resign. I do not feel that I belong to a Lost Generation, and I have never felt so. Indeed, I doubt very much the existence of a Lost Generation, except insofar as every generation, groping, must be lost. Recently, however, it has occurred to me that if there is such a thing as a Lost Generation in this country, it is probably made up of those men of advanced middle age who still speak the language that was spoken before 1929, and who know no other. These men indubitably are lost. But I am not one of them.",1
5469,"Although I don't believe, then, that I was ever part of any Lost Generation anywhere, the fact remains that, as an individual, I was lost. Perhaps that is one reason, Fox, why for so long I needed you so desperately. For I was lost, and was looking for someone older and wiser to show me the way, and I found you, and you took the place of my father who had died. In our nine years together you did help me find the way, though you could hardly have been aware just how you did it, and the road now leads off in a direction contrary to your intent. For the fact is that now I no longer feel lost, and I want to tell you why.",1
5470,"When I returned to Pine Rock and finished my course and graduated--I was only twenty then--I don't suppose it would have been possible to find a more confused and baffled person than I was. I had been sent to college-to ""prepare myself for life"", as the phrase went in those days, and it almost seemed that the total effect of my college training was to produce in me a state of utter unpreparedness. I had come from one of the most conservative parts of America, and from one of the most conservative elements in those parts. All of my antecedents, until a generation before, had been country people whose living had been in one way or another drawn out of the earth.",1
5471,"My father, John Webber, had been all of his life a working man. He had done hard labour with his hands since the time he was twelve years old. As I have often told you, he was a man of great natural ability and intelligence. But, like many other men who have been deprived of the advantages of formal education, he was ambitious for his son: he wanted more than anything else in the world to see me go to college. He died just before I was prepared to enter, but it was on the money he left me that I went. It is only natural that people like my father should endow formal education with a degree of practicality which it does not and should not posssess. College seemed to him a kind of magic door which not only opened to a man all the reserves of learning, but also admitted him to free passage along any high road to material success which he might choose to follow after he had passed through the pleasant academic groves. It was only natural, too, that such a man as my father should believe that this success could be most easily arrived at along one of the more familiar and more generally approved roads.",1
5472,"The road he had chosen for me before his death was a branch of engineering. He stubbornly opposed the Joyner choice, which was the law. The old man had small use for the law as a profession, and very little respect for the lawyer as a man; his usual description of lawyers was ""a gang of shysters"". When I went to see him as he lay dying, his last advice to me was:  ""Learn to do something, learn to make something--that's what college should be for.",1
5473,"His bitterest regret was that the poverty of his early years had prevented him from learning any skill beyond that of a carpenter and a mason. He was a good carpenter, a good mason--in his last days he liked to call himself a builder, which indeed he was--but I think he felt in himself, like a kind of dumb and inarticulate suffering, the unachieved ability to design and shape. Certainly he would have been profoundly disappointed if he could have known what strange forms his own desires for ""doing"" and for ""making"" were to achieve in me. I cannot say what extremity--law or writing--would have filled him with the most disgust.",1
5474,"But by the time I left college it was already apparent that whatever talents I might have, they were neither for engineering nor the law. I had not the technical ability for the one, and, in view of what I was to discover for myself in later years, I think I was too honest for the other. But what to do? My academic career, with the crowning disgrace of complicity in the Pine Rock case and temporary expulsion from college, had not been distinguished by any very glittering records in scholarship except that One in Logic. I had failed both my father and the Joyner side of the house in any ambitions they had had for me. My father was dead, and the Joyners were now done with me.",1
5475,"For all these reasons, it was difficult to admit, even to myself, the stirrings of an urge so fantastic and impractical as the desire to write. It would only have confirmed the worst suspicions that my people had of me--suspicions, I fear, which had begun to eat into my own opinion of myself. Consequently, the first admission I made to myself was evasive. I told myself that I wanted to go into journalism. Now, looking back at it, I can see the reason for this decision clearly enough. I doubt very much that I had, at the age of twenty, the burning enthusiasm for newspaper work which I thought I had, but I managed to convince myself of it because newspaper work would provide me with the only means I knew whereby I could, in some fashion, write, and also earn a living, and thus prove to the world and to myself that I was not wasting my time.",1
5476,"To have confessed openly to my family that I wanted to be a writer would have been impossible. To be a writer was, in modern phrase, ""nice work if you could get it"". In the Joyner consciousness, as well as in my own, ""a writer"" was a very remote kind of person. He was a romantic figure like Lord Byron, or Longfellow, or--or--Irvin S. Cobb--who in some magical way was gifted with the power to put words together into poems or stories or novels which got printed in books or in the pages of magazines like the Saturday Evening Post. He was therefore, quite obviously, a very strange, mysterious sort of creature who lived a very strange, mysterious, and glittering sort of life, and who came from some strange and mysterious and glittering world very far away from the life and world we knew. For a boy who had grown up in the town of Libya Hill to assert openly that he wanted to be a writer would have seemed to everyone at that time to border on lunacy. It would have harked back to the days of Uncle Rance Joyner, who wasted his youth learning to play the violin, and who in later life borrowed fifty dollars from Uncle Mark to take a course in phrenology. I had always been told that there was a strong resemblance between myself and Uncle Rance, and now I knew that if I confessed my secret desires, everyone would have thought the likeness more pronounced than ever.",1
5477,"It was a painful situation, and one which is now amusing to look back on. But it was also very human--and very American. Even today I don't think the Joyners have altogether recovered from their own astonishment at the fact that I have actually become ""a writer"". This attitude, which was also my own at the age of twenty, was to shape the course of my life for years.",1
5478,"So, fresh from college, I took what remained of the small inheritance my father had left me, and, with an exultant sense that I had packed my secret into my suitcase along with my extra pants, I started out, boy and baggage, on the road to fame and glory. That is to say, I came to New York to look for a job on a newspaper. I did look for the job, but not too hard, and I didn't find it. Meanwhile I had enough money to live on and I began to write. Later, when the money ran out, I condescended to become an instructor in one of the great educational factories of the city. This was another compromise, but it had one virtue--it enabled me to live and go on writing.",1
5479,"During the first year in New York I shared an apartment with a group of boys, transplanted Southerners like myself, whom I had known in college. Through one of them I made the acquaintance of some artistic young fellows who were living in what I swiftly learned to call ""The Village"". Here, for the first time, I was thrown into the company of sophisticated young men of my own age--at least they seemed very sophisticated to me. For instead of being like me, an uncouth yokel from the backwoods, all rough edges, who felt within himself the timid but unspoken flutterings of a desire to write, these young gentlemen had come down from Harvard, they had the easy manner of men of the world, and they casually but quite openly told me that they were writers. And so they were. They wrote, and were published, in some of the little experimental magazines which were springing up on all sides during that period. How I envied them!",1
5480,"They were not only able to assert openly that they were writers, but they also asserted openly that a great many other people that I had thought were writers--most dismally were not. When I made hesitant efforts to take part in the brilliant conversation that flashed around me, I began to discover that I would have to be prepared for some very rude shocks. It was decidedly disconcerting, for example, to ask one of these most superior young men, so carelessly correct in their rough tweeds and pink cheeks: ""Have you ever read Gals-worthy's Strife?""--and to have him raise his eyebrows slowly, exhale a slow column of cigarette smoke, slowly shake his head, and then say in an accent of resigned regret: ""I can't read him. I simply can't read him. Sorry----"" with a rising inflection as if to say that it was too bad, but that it couldn't be helped.",1
5481,"They were sorry about a great many things and people. The theatre was one of their most passionate concerns, but it seemed that there was hardly a dramatist writing in those days who escaped their censure. Shaw was amusing, but he was not a dramatist--he had never really learned how to write a play. O'Neill's reputation was grossly exaggerated: his dialogue was clumsy, and his characters stock types. Barrie was insufferable on account of his sentimentality. As for Pinero and others of that ilk, their productions were already so dated that they were laughable.",1
5482,"In a way, this super-criticality was a very good thing for me. It taught me to be more questioning about some of the most venerated names and reputations whose authority had been handed down to me by my preceptors and accepted by me with too little thought. But the trouble with it was that I soon became involved, along with the others, in a niggling and over-refined aestheticism which was not only pallid and precious, but too detached from life to provide the substance and the inspiration for high creative work.",1
5483,"It is interesting to look back now and see just what it was we believed fifteen years ago--those of us who were the bright young people of the time and wanted to produce something of value in the arts. We talked a great deal about ""art"" and ""beauty""--a great deal about ""the artist"". A great deal too much, in fact. For the artist as we conceived him was a kind of aesthetic monster. Certainly he was not a living man. And if the artist is not first and foremost a living man--and by this I mean a man of life, a man who belongs to life, who is connected with it so intimately that he draws his strength from it--then what manner of man is he?",1
5484,"The artist we talked about was not such a man at all. Indeed, if he had any existence outside of our imagination he must have been one of the most extraordinary and inhuman freaks that nature ever created. Instead of loving life and believing in life, our ""artist"" hated life and fled from it. That, in fact, was the basic theme of most of the stories, plays, and novels we wrote. We were forever portraying the sensitive man of talent, the young genius, crucified by life, misunderstood and scorned of men, pilloried and driven out by the narrow bigotry and mean provincialism of the town or village, betrayed and humiliated by the cheapness of his wife, and finally crushed, silenced, torn to pieces by the organised power of the mob. So conceived, the artist that we talked about so much, instead of being in union with life, was in perpetual conflict with it. Instead of belonging to the world he lived in, he was constantly in a state of flight from it. The world itself was like a beast of prey, and the artist, like some wounded faun, was for ever trying to escape from it.",1
5485,"It seems to me now, as I look back on it, that the total deposit of all this was bad. It gave to young people who were deficient in the vital materials and experiences of life, and in the living contacts which the artist ought to have with life, the language and formulas of an unwholesome preciosity. It armed them with a philosophy, an aesthetic, of escapism. It tended to create in those of us who were later to become artists not only a special but a privileged character: each of us tended to think of himself as a person who was exempt from the human laws that govern other men, who was not subject to the same desires, the same feelings, the same passions--who was, in short, a kind of beautiful disease in nature, like a pearl in an oyster.",1
5486,"The effect of all this upon such a person as myself may easily be deduced. Now, for the first time, I was provided with a protective armour, a glittering and sophisticated defence to shield my own self-doubts, my inner misgivings, my lack of confidence in my power and ability to accomplish what I wanted to do. The result was to make me arrogantly truculent where my own desires and purposes were concerned. I began to talk the jargon just as the others did, to prate about ""the artist"", and to refer scornfully and contemptuously to the bourgeoisie, the Babbitts, and the Philistines--by which all of us meant anyone who did not belong to the very small and precious province we had fashioned for ourselves.",1
5487,"Looking back, in an effort to see myself as I was in those days, I am afraid I was not a very friendly or agreeable young man. I was carrying a chip on my shoulder, and daring the whole world to knock it off. And the reason I so often took a high tone with people who, it seemed to me, doubted my ability to do the thing I wanted to do, was that, inwardly, I was by no means sure that I could do it myself. It was a form of whistling to keep one's courage up.",1
5488,"That was the kind of man I was when you first knew me, Fox. Ah, yes, I spoke about the work I wished to do in phrases of devotion and humility, but there was not much of either in me. Inside, I was full of the disdainful scorn of the small and precious mob. I felt superior to other people and thought I belonged to a rare breed. I had not yet learned that one cannot really be superior without humility and tolerance and human understanding. I did not yet know that in order to belong to a rare and higher breed one must first develop the true power and talent of selfless immolation.",1
5489,"46. Even Two Angels Not Enough Since childhood [George wrote to Fox] I had wanted what all men want in youth: to be famous, to be loved. These two desires went back through all the steps, degrees, and shadings of my education; they represented what we younglings of the time had been taught to believe in and to want.  Love and Fame.",1
5490,"Well, I have had them both. You told me once, Fox, that I did not want them, that I only thought I did. You were right. I wanted them desperately before I had them, but once they were mine, I found that they were not enough. And I think, if we speak truth, the same thing holds for every man who ever lived and had the spark of growth in him.",1
5491,"It has never been dangerous to admit that Fame is not enough--one of the world's greatest poets called it ""that last infirmity of Noble mind""--but it is dangerous, for reasons which everybody understands, to admit the infirmity of Love. Perhaps Love's image may suffice some men. Perhaps, as in a drop of shining water, Love may hold in microcosm the reflection of the sun and the stars and the 'heavens and the whole universe of man. Mighty poets dead and gone have said that this was true, and people have professed it ever since. As for that, I can only say that I do not think a frog pond or a Walden Pond contains the image of the ocean, even though there be water in both of them.",1
5492,"Love is enough, though the world be a-waning,"" wrote William Morris. We have his word for it, and can believe it or not as we like. Perhaps it was true for him, yet I doubt it. It may have been true at the moment he wrote it, but not in the end, not when all was said and done.",1
5493,"As for myself, I did not find it so. For, even while I was most securely caught up and enclosed within the inner circle of Love's bondage, I began to discover a larger world outside. It did not dawn upon me in a sudden and explosive sense, the way the world of Chapman's Homer burst upon John Keats:  ""Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken.",1
5494,"It did not come like that at all. It came in on me little by little, almost without my knowing it. Up to that time I had been merely the sensitive young fellow in conflict with his town, his family, the life around him--then the sensitive young fellow in love, and so concerned with his little Universe of Love that he thought it the whole universe. But gradually I began to observe things in life which shocked me out of this complete absorption with the independent entities of self. I caught glimpses of the great, the rich, the fortunate ones of all the earth living supinely upon the very best of everything and taking the very best for granted as their right. I saw them enjoying a special privilege which had been theirs so long that it had become a vested interest: they seemed to think it was a law ordained of nature that they should be for ever life's favourite sons. At the same time I began to be conscious of the submerged and forgotten Helots down below, who with their toil and sweat and blood and suffering unutterable supported and nourished the mighty princelings at the top.",1
5495,"Then came the cataclysm of 1929 and the terrible days that followed. The picture became clearer now--clear enough for all with eyes to see. Through those years I was living in the jungle depths of Brooklyn, and I saw as I had never seen before the true and terrifying visage of the disinherited of life. There came to me a vision of man's inhumanity to man, and as time went on it began to blot out the more personal and self-centred vision of the world which a young man always has. Then it was, I think, that I began to learn humility. My intense and passionate concern for the interests and designs of my own little life were coming to seem petty, trifling, and unworthy, and I was coming more and more to feel an intense and passionate concern for the interests and designs of my fellow-men and of all humanity.",1
5496,"Of course I have vastly oversimplified the process in my telling of it. While it was at work in me I was but dimly aware of it. It is only now, as I look back upon those years, that I can see in true perspective the meaning of what was happening to me then. For human nature is, alas, a muddy pool, too full of sediment, too murky with the deposits of time, too churned up by uncharted currents in the depths and on the surface, to reflect a sharp, precise, and wholly faithful image. For that, one has to wait until the waters settle down, It follows, then, that one can never hope, however much he wishes that he could, to shed the old integuments of the soul as easily and completely as a snake sloughs off its outworn skin.",1
5497,"For, even at the time when this new vision of the outer world was filtering in and making its strange forms manifest to me, I was also more involved than I had ever been before with my inner struggle. Those were the years of the greatest doubt and desperation I had ever known. I was wrestling with the problems of my second book, and I could take in what my eyes beheld only in brief glimpses, flashes, snatches, fragments. As I was later to discover, the vision etched itself upon some sensitive film within, but it was not until that later time, when the second book was finished and out of the way, that I saw it whole and knew what the total experience had done to me.",1
5498,"And all the while, of course, I was still enamoured of that fair Medusa, Fame. My desire for her was a relic of the past. All the guises of Fame's loveliness--phantasmal, ghostwise, like something flitting in a wood--I had dreamed of since my early youth, until her image and the image of the loved one had a thousand times been merged together. I had always wanted to be loved and to be famous. Now I had known Love, but Fame was still elusive. So in the writing of my second book I courted her.",1
5499,"Then, for the first time, I saw her. I met Mr. Lloyd McHarg. That curious experience should have taught me something. And in a way I suppose it did. For in Lloyd McHarg I met a truly great and honest man who had aspired to Fame and won her, and I saw that it had been an empty victory. He had her more completely than I could ever hope to have her, yet it was apparent that, for him, Fame was not enough. He needed something more, and he had not found it.",1
5500,"I say I should have learned from that. And yet, how could I? Does one ever really learn from others till one is ready for the lesson? One may read the truth in another's life and see it plain and still not make the application to oneself. Does not one's glorious sense of ""I""--this wonderful, unique ""I"" that never was before since time began and never will be again hereafter--does not this ""I"" of tender favour come before the eye of judgment and always plead exception. I thought: ""Yes, I see how it is with Lloyd McHarg, but with me it will be different--because I am I."" That is how it has always been with me. I could never learn anything except the hard way. I must experience it for myself before I knew.",1
5501,"So with Fame. In the end I had to have her. She was another woman--of all Love's rivals, as I was to find by a strange paradox, the only one by women and by Love beloved. And I had her, as she may be had--only to discover that Fame, like Love, was not enough.",1
5502,"By then life's weather had soaked in, although I was not fully conscious yet what seepings had begun, or where, in what directions, the channel of my life was flowing. All I knew was that I was exhausted from my labour, respiring from the race, conscious only, as is a spent runner, that the race was over, the tape breasted, and that in such measure I had won. This was the only thought within me at the time: the knowledge that I had met the ordeal a second time and at last had conquered--conquered my desperation and self-doubt, the fear that I might never come again to a whole and final accomplishment.",1
5503,"Then the circle went full swing, the cycle drew to its full close. For several months, emptied, hollow, worn out, my life marked time while my exhausted spirit drew its breath. But after a while the world came in again, upon the flood tide of reviving energy. The world came in, the world kept coming in, and there was something in the world, and in my heart, that I had not known was there.",1
5504,"I had gone back for rest, for recreation, for oblivion, to that land which, of all the foreign lands that I had visited, I loved the best. Many times during the years of desperate confinement and labour on the book I had thought of it with intense longing, as men in prison, haltered to all the dusty shackles of the hour, have longed for the haunted woods and meadows of Cockaigne. Many times I had gone back to it in my dreams--to the sunken bell, the Gothic towns, the plash of waters in the midnight fountain, the Old Place, the broken chime, and the blonde flesh of secret, lavish women. Then at last came the day when I walked at morning through the Brandenburger Tor, and into the enchanted avenues of the faery green Tiergarten, and found that Fame had come to me. It was May, and I walked below the blossoms of the great horse-chestnut trees, and felt like Tamerlane, that it was passing fine to be a king and move in triumph through Persepolis--and be a famous man.",1
5505,"After those long and weary years of labour, and the need of proof to give some easement to my tormented soul, this was the easement I had dreamed of, the impossible thing so impossibly desired, now brought magically to fulfilment. And now it seemed to me, who had so often gone a stranger and unknown to the great cities of the world, that Berlin was mine. For weeks there was a round of pleasure and celebration, and the wonderful thrill of meeting in a foreign land and in a foreign tongue a hundred friends, now for the first time known and captured. There was the sapphire sparkle in the air, the enchanted brevity of northern darkness, the glorious wine in slender bottles, and morning, and green fields, and pretty women--all of these were mine now, they seemed to have been created for me, to have been waiting for me, and to exist now in all their loveliness just for my possession.",1
5506,"The weeks passed so--and then it happened. Little by little the world came in. At first it sifted in almost unnoticed, like dark down dropped in passing from some avenging angel's wing. Sometimes it came to me in the desperate pleading of an eye, the naked terror of a startled look, the swift concealment of a sudden fear. Sometimes it just came and went as light comes, just soaked in, just soaked in--in fleeting words and speech and actions.",1
5507,"After a while, however, in the midwatches of the night, behind thick walls and bolted doors and shuttered windows, it came to me full flood at last in confessions of unutterable despair. I don't know why it was that people so unburdened themselves to me, a stranger, unless it was because they knew the love I bore them and their land. They seemed to feel a desperate need to talk to someone who would understand. The thing was pent up in them, and my sympathy for all things German had burst the dam of their reserve and caution. Their tales of woe and fear unspeakable gushed forth and beat upon my ears. They told me stories of their friends and relatives who had said unguarded things in public and disappeared without a trace, stories of the Gestapo, stories of neighbours' quarrels and petty personal spite turned into political persecution, stories of concentration camps and pogroms, stories of rich Jews stripped and beaten and robbed of everything they had and then denied the right to earn a pauper's wage, stories of well-bred Jewesses despoiled and turned out of their homes and forced to kneel and scrub off anti-Nazi slogans scribbled on the pavements while young barbarians dressed like soldiers formed a ring and prodded them with bayonets and made the quiet places echo with the shameless laughter of their mockery. It was a picture of the Dark Ages come again--shocking beyond belief, but true as the hell that man forever creates for himself.",1
5508,"Thus it was that the corruption of man's living faith and the inferno of his buried anguish came to me--and I recognised at last, in all its frightful aspects, the spiritual disease which was poisoning unto death a noble and a mighty people. But even as I saw it and knew it for what it was, there came to me, most strangely, another thing as well. For while I sat the night through in the darkened rooms of German friends, behind the bolted doors and shuttered windows--while their whispered voices spoke to me of the anguish in their hearts, and I listened, stricken in my chair to see the tears and the graven lines of mortal sorrow form on faces which only a short time before, in the presence of others, had been masked in expressions of carefree unconcern--while I heard and saw these things my heart was torn asunder, and from its opened depths came forth into my consciousness a knowledge that I had not fully known was there. For then it was, most curiously, that all the grey weather of unrecorded days in Brooklyn, which had soaked through into my soul, came flooding back upon me. Came back, too, the memory of my exploration of the jungle trails of night. I saw again the haggard faces of the homeless men, the wanderers, the disinherited of America, the aged workers who had worked and now could work no more, the callow boys who had never worked and now could find no work to do, and who, both together, had been cast loose by a society that had no need of them and left to shift in any way they could--to find their food in garbage cans, to seek for warmth and fellowship in foul latrines like the one near New York's City Hall, to sleep wrapped up in old newspapers on the concrete floors of subway corridors.",1
5509,"It all came back to me, all the separate fragments of the vision I had seen, together with the sinister remembrance of that upper world of night, glittering with its riches, and its soft, sophisticated pleasures, and its cold indifference to the misery and injustice on which its very life was founded. It all came back, but now it was an integrated picture. So it was, in this far place and under these profoundly moving and disturbing alien circumstances, that I realised fully, for the first time, how sick America was, and saw, too, that the ailment was akin to Germany's--a dread world-sickness of the soul. One of my German friends, Franz Heilig, later told me this same thing. In Germany it was hopeless: it had already gone too far to be checked now by any measures short of death, destruction, and total ruin. But in America, it seemed to me, it was not mortal, not incurable--not yet. It was desperate, and would become more desperate still if in America, as in Germany, men became afraid to look into the face of fear itself, to probe behind it, to see what caused it, and then to speak the truth about it. America was young, America was still the New World of mankind's hope, America was not like this old and worn-out Europe which seethed and festered with a thousand deep and uncorrected ancient maladies. America was still resilient, still responsive to a cure--if only--if only--men could somehow cease to be afraid of truth. For the plain and searching light of truth, which had here, in Germany, been darkened to extinction, was the remedy, the only one, that could cleanse and heal the suffering soul of man.",1
5510,"After such a night of seeing whole at last, day would come again, the cool glow of morning, the bronze gold of the kiefern-trees, the still green pools of lucid water, the enchanted parks and gardens--but none of it was the same as it had been before. For now I knew that there was something else in life as new as morning and as old as hell, a universal ill of man seen here in Germany at its darkest, and here articulated for the first time in a word, regimented now in a scheme of phrases and a system of abominable works. And day by day the thing soaked in, and kept soaking in, until everywhere, in every life I met and touched, I saw the ruin of its unutterable pollutions.",1
5511,"So now another layer had been peeled off the gauzes of the seeing eye. And what the eye had seen and understood, I knew that it could nevermore forget or again be blind to. 47. Ecciesiasticus Now I have told you [George wrote to Fox] some of the things that have happened to me and the effect they had upon me. But what has all of this to do with you?--you may ask. I am coming to that now.",1
5512,"In the beginning I spoke about my ""philosophy of life"" when I was a student in college twenty years ago. I didn't tell you what it was because I don't think I really had one then. I'm not sure I have one now. But I think it is interesting and important that I should have thought I had one at the age of seventeen, and that people still talk about ""a philosophy of life"" as though it were a concrete object that you could pick up and handle and take the weight and dimensions of. Just recently I was asked to contribute to a book called Modern-Day Philosophies. I tried to write something for it but gave it up, because I was unwilling and unready to say that I had a ""modern-day philosophy"". And the reason that I was unwilling and unready was not that I felt confusion and doubt about what I think and now believe, but that I felt confusion and doubt about saying it in formalistic and final terms.",1
5513,"That was what was wrong with most of us at Pine Rock College twenty years ago. We had a ""concept"" about Truth and Beauty and Love and Reality--and that hardened our ideas about what all these words stood for. After that, we had no doubt about them--or, at any rate, could not admit that we did. This was wrong, because the essence of belief is doubt, the essence of reality is questioning. The essence of Time is Flow, not Fix. The essence of faith is the knowledge that all flows and that everything must change. The growing man is Man-Alive, and his ""philosophy"" must grow, must flow, with him. When it does not, we have--do we not?--the Unfixed Man, the Eternal Trifler, the Ape of Fashion--the man too fixed to-day, unfixed to-morrow--and his body of beliefs is nothing but a series of fixations.",1
5514,"I cannot attempt, therefore, to define for you your own ""philosophy""--for to define so is to delimit the ""closed"" and academic man, and you, thank God, are not of that ilk. And to define so would be to call upon me once again your own and curious scorn, your sudden half-amused contemptuousness. For how could anyone pin down neatly the essence of your New Englandness--so sensitively proud, so shy, so shrinking and alone, but at bottom, as I think, so unafraid?",1
5515,"I shall not define you, then, dear Fox. But I may state, may I not? I may say how ""it seems to me""?--how Fox appears?--and what I think of it?",1
5516,"Well, first of all, Fox seems to me to be Ecclesiasticus. I think that this is fair, and, insofar as definition goes, I think you will agree. Do you know of any definition that could possibly go further? I do not. In thirty-seven years of thinking, feeling, dreaming, working, striving, voyaging, and devouring, I have come across no other that could fit you half so well. Perhaps something has been written, painted, sung, or spoken in the world that would define you better: if it has, I have not seen it; and if I did see it, then I should feel like one who came upon a Sistine Chapel greater than the first, which no man living yet has heard about.",1
5517,"So far as I can see from nine years of observing you, yours is the way of life, the way of thought, of feeling, and of acting, of the Preacher in Ecclesiastes. I know of no better way. For of all that I have ever seen or learned, that book seems to me the noblest, the wisest, and the most powerful expression of man's life upon this earth--and also earth's highest flower of poetry, eloquence, and truth. I am not given to dogmatic judgments in the matter of literary creation, but if I had to make one I could only say that Ecclesiastes is the greatest single piece of writing I have ever known, and the wisdom expressed in it the most lasting and profound.",1
5518,"And I should say that it expresses your own position as perfectly as anything could. I have read it over many times each year, and I do not know of a single word or stanza in it with which you would not instantly agree. You would agree--to quote just a few precepts which come to mind from that noble book--that a good name is better than precious ointment; and I think you would also agree that the day of death is better than the day of one's birth. You would agree with the great Preacher that all things are full of labour; that man cannot utter it; that the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. I know you would agree also that the thing that hath been, is that which shall be; and that that which is done, is that which shall be done: and that there is no new thing under the sun. You would agree that it is vexation of spirit to give one's heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I know you would agree--for you have so admonished me many times--that to everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.",1
5519,"Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity. You would agree with him in that; but you would also agree with him that the fool foldeth his hands together and eateth his own flesh. You would agree with all your being that ""Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. Is this abridgement and this definition just, dear Fox?",1
5520,"Yes, for I have seen every syllable of it in you a thousand times. I have learned every accent of it from yourself. You said one time, when I had spoken of you in the dedication of a book, that what I had written would be your epitaph. You were mistaken. Your epitaph was written many centuries ago: Ecclesiastes is your epitaph. Your portrait had been drawn already in the portrait the great Preacher had given of himself. You are he, his words are yours so perfectly that if he had never lived or uttered them, all of him, all of his great and noble Sermon, could have been derived afresh from you.",1
5521,"If I could, therefore, define your own philosophy--and his--I think I should define it as the philosophy of a hopeful fatalism. Both of you are in the essence pessimists, but both of you are also pessimists with hope. From both of you I learned much, many true and hopeful things. I learned, first of all, that one must work, that one must do what work he can, as well and ably as he can, and that it is only the fool who repines and longs for what is vanished, for what might have been but is not. I learned from both of you the stein lesson of acceptance: to acknowledge the tragic underweft of life into which man is born, through which he must live, out of which he must die. I learned from both of you to accept that essential fact without complaint, but, having accepted it, to try to do what was before me, what I could do, with all my might.",1
5522,"And, curiously--for here comes in the strange, hard paradox of our twin polarity--it was just here, I think, where I was so much and so essentially in confirmation with you, that I began to disagree. I think almost that I could say to you: ""I believe in everything you say, but I do not agree with you""--and so state the root of our whole trouble, the mystery of our eventual cleavage and our final severance. The little tongues will wag--have wagged, I understand, already--will propose a thousand quick and ready explanations ( as they have)--but really, Fox, the root of the whole thing is here.",1
5523,"In one of the few letters that you ever wrote to me--a wonderful and moving one just recently--you said:  ""I know that you are going now. I always knew that it would happen. I will not try to stop you, for it had to be. And yet, the strange thing is, the hard thing is, I have never known another man with whom I was so profoundly in agreement on all essential things.",1
5524,"And that is the strange, hard thing, and wonderful and mysterious; for, in a way the little clacking tongues can never know about, it is completely true. Still, there is our strange paradox: it seems to me that in the orbit of our world you are the North Pole, I the South--so much in balance, in agreement--and yet, dear Fox, the whole world lies between. 'Tis true, our view of life was very much the same. When we looked out together, we saw man burned with the same sun, frozen by the same cold, beat upon by the hardships of the same impervious weathers, duped by the same gullibility, self-betrayed by the same folly, misled and baffled by the same stupidity. Each on the opposing hemisphere of his own pole looked out across the spinning orbit of this vexed, tormented world, and at the other, and what each saw, the picture that each got, was very much the same. We not only saw the stupidity and the folly and the gullibility and the self-deception of man, but we saw his nobility, courage, and aspiration, too. We saw the wolves that preyed upon him and laid him waste--the wild scavangers of greed, of fear, of privilege, of power, of tyranny, of oppression, of poverty and disease, of injustice, cruelty, and wrong--Land in what we saw of this as well, dear Fox, we were agreed.",1
5525,"Why, then, the disagreement? Why, then, the struggle that ensued, the severance that has now occurred? We saw the same things, and we called them by the same names. We abhorred them with the same indignation and disgust--and yet, we disagreed, and I am making my farewell to you. Dear friend, the parent and the guardian of my spirit in its youth, the thing has happened and we know it. Why?  I know the answer, and the thing I have to tell you now is this:  Beyond the limits of my own mortality, the stern acknowledgment that man was born to live, to suffer, and to die--your own and the great Preacher's creed--I am not, cannot be, confirmed to more fatality.",1
5526,"Briefly, you thought the ills which so beset mankind were irremediable: that just as man was born to live, to suffer, and to die, so was he born to be eternally beset and preyed upon by all the monsters of his own creation--by fear and cruelty, by tyranny and power, by poverty and wealth. You felt, with the stern fatality of resignation which is the granite essence of your nature, that these things were doomed to be, and be for ever, because they had always been, and were inherent in the tainted and tormented soul of man. Dear Fox, dear friend, I heard you and I understood you--but could not agree. You felt--I heard you and I understood--that if old monsters were destroyed, new ones would be created in their place. You felt that if old tyrannies were overthrown, new ones, as sinister and evil, would reign after them. You felt that all the glaring evils in the woad around us--the monstrous and perverse unbalance between power and servitude, between want and plenty, between privilege and burdensome discrimination--were inevitable because they had always been the curse of man and were the prime conditions of his being. The gap between us widened. You stated and affirmed--I heard you, but could not agree.",1
5527,"To state your rule and conduct plainly, I think I never knew a kinder or a gentler man, but I also never knew a man more fatally resigned. In practice--in life and conduct--I have seen the Sermon of the Preacher work out in you like a miracle. I have seen you grow haggard and grey because you saw a talent wasted, a life misused, work undone that should be done. I have seen you move mountains to save something which, you felt, was worth the effort and could be saved. I have seen you perform prodigies of labour and patience to pull a drowning man of talent out of the swamp of failure into which his life was sinking; and at each successive slipping back, so far from acknowledging defeat with resignation and regret, you made your eyes flash fire and you will toughen to the hardness of forged steel as I saw you strike your hand upon the table and heard you whisper, with an almost savage intensity of passion: ""He must not go. He is not lost. I will not, and he must not, let it happen! To give this noble virtue of your life the etching of magnificence it deserves, it is your due to have it stated here.",1
5528,"For, without it, there can be no proper understanding of your worth, your true dimension. To describe the acquiescence of your stern fatality without first describing the inspired tenacity of your effort would be to give a false and insufficient picture of the strangest and the most familiar, the most devious and the most direct, the simplest and the most complex figure that this nation and this generation have produced. To say that you looked on at all the suffering and injustice of this vexed, tormented world with the toleration of resigned fatality without telling also of your own devoted and miraculous effort to save what could be saved, would not do justice to you. No man ever better fulfilled the injunction of the Preacher to lay about him and to do the work at hand with all his might. No man ever gave himself more wholly, not only to the fulfilment of that injunction for himself, but to the task of saving others who had failed to do it, and who might be saved. But no man ever accepted the irremediable with more quiet unconcern. I think you would risk your life to save that of a friend who put himself uselessly and wantonly in peril, but I know, too, that you would accept the fact of unavoidable death without regret. I have seen you grow grey-faced and hollow-eyed with worry over the condition of a beloved child who was suffering from a nervous shock or ailment that the doctors could not diagnose. You found the cause eventually and checked it; but I know that if the cause had been fatal and incurable, you would have accepted that fact with a resignation as composed as your own effort was inspired.",1
5529,"All of this makes the paradox of our great difference as bard and strange as the paradox of our polarity. And in this lies the root of trouble and the seed of severance. Your own philosophy has led you to accept the order of things as they are because you have no hope of changing them; and if you could change them, you feel that any other order would be just as bad. In everlasting terms--those of eternity--you and the Preacher may be right: for there is no greater wisdom than the wisdom of Ecclesiastes, no acceptance finally so true as the stern fatalism of the rock. Man was born to live, to suffer, and to die, and what befalls him is a tragic lot. There is no denying this in the final end. But we must, dear Fox, deny it all along the way.",1
5530,"Mankind was fashioned for eternity, but Man-Alive was fashioned for a day. New evils will come after him, but it is with the present evils that he is now concerned. And the essence of all faith, it seems to me, for such a man as I, the essence of religion for people of my belief, is that man's life can be, and will be, better; that man's greatest enemies, in the forms in which they now exist--the forms we see on every hand of fear, hatred, slavery, cruelty, poverty, and need--can be conquered and destroyed. But to conquer and destroy them will mean nothing less than the complete revision of the structure of society as we know it. They cannot be conquered by the sorrowful acquiescence of resigned fatality. They cannot be destroyed by the philosophy of acceptance--by the tragic hypothesis that things as they are, evil as they are, are as good and as bad as, under any form-they will ever be. The evils that we hate, you no less than I, cannot be overthrown with shrugs and sighs and shakings of the head how, ever wise. It seems to me that they but mock at us and only become more bold when we retreat before them and take refuge in the affirmation of man's tragic average. To believe that new monsters will arise as vicious as the old, to believe that the great Pandora's box of human frailty, once opened, will never show a diminution of its ugly swarm, is to help, by just that much, to make it so for ever.",1
5531,"You and the Preacher may be right for all eternity, but we Men-Alive, dear Fox, are right for Now. And it is for Now, and for us the living, that we must speak, and speak the truth, as much of it as we can see and know. With the courage of the truth within us, we shall meet the enemy as they come to us, and they shall be ours. And if, once having conquered them, new enemies approach, we shall meet them from that point, from there proceed. In the affirmation of that fact, the continuance of that unceasing war, is man's religion and his living faith.  48.",1
5532,"Credo I have never before made a statement of belief [George wrote in his conclusion to Fox], although I have believed in many things and said that I believed in them. But I have never stated my belief in concrete terms because almost every element of my nature has been opposed to the hard framework, the finality, of formulation. Just as you are the rock of life, I am the web; just as you are Time's granite, so, I think, am I Time's plant. My life, more than that of anyone I know, has taken on the form of growth. No man that I have known was ever more deeply rooted in the soil of Time and Memory, the weather of his individual universe, than was I. You followed me through the course of that whole herculean conflict. For four years, as I lived and worked and explored the jungle depths of Brooklyn--jungle depths coincident with those of my own soul--you were beside me, you followed, and you stuck.",1
5533,"You never had a doubt that I would finish--make an end--round out the cycle--come to the whole of it. The only doubt was mine, enhanced, tormented by my own fatigue and desperation, and by the clacking of the feeble and malicious little tongues which, knowing nothing, whispered that I would never make an end again because I could not begin. We both knew how grotesquely false this was--so false and so grotesque that it was sometimes the subject of an anguished and exasperated laugh. The truth was so far different that my own fears were just the opposite: that I might never make an end to anything again because I could never get through telling what I knew, what I felt and thought and had to say about it.",1
5534,"That was a giant web in which I was caught, the product of my huge inheritance--the torrential recollectiveness, derived out of my mother's stock, which became a living, million-fibred integument that bound me to the past, not only of my own life, but of the very earth from which I came, so that nothing in the end escaped from its inrooted and all-feeling explorativeness. The way the sunlight came and went upon a certain day, the way grass felt between bare toes, the immediacy of noon, the slamming of an iron gate, the halting skreak upon the corner of a street car, the liquid sound of shoe leather on the pavements as men came home to lunch, the smell of turnip greens, the clang of ice-tongs, and the clucking of a hen--and then Time fading like a dream, Time melting to oblivion, when I was two years old. Not only this, but all lost sounds and voices, forgotten memories exhumed with a constant pulsing of the 'brain's great ventricle, until I lived them in my dreams, carrying the stupendous and unceasing burden of them through the unresting passages of sleep. Nothing that had ever been was lost. It all came back in an endless flow, even the blisters of the paint upon the mantelpiece in my father's house, the smell of the old leather sofa with my father's print upon it, the smell of dusty bottles and of cobwebs in the cellar, the casual stomping of a slow, gaunt hoof upon the pulpy lumber of a livery stable floor, the proud lift and flourish of a whisking tail, and the oaty droppings. I lived again through all times and weathers I had known--through the fag-ends of wintry desolation in the month of March and the cold, bleak miseries of ragged red at sunset, the magic of young green in April, the blind horror and suffocation of concrete places in mid-summer sun where no limits were, and October with the smell of fallen leaves and wood smoke in the air. The forgotten moments and unnumbered hours came back to me with all the enormous cargo of my memory, together with lost voices in the mountains long ago, the voices of the kinsmen dead and never seen, and the houses they had built and died in, and the rutted roads they trod upon, and every unrecorded moment that Aunt Maw had told me of the lost and obscure lives they led long, long ago. So did it all revive in the ceaseless pulsings of the giant ventricle, so did the plant go back, stem by stem, root by root, and filament by filament, until it was complete and whole, compacted of the very earth that had produced it, and of which it was itself the last and living part.",1
5535,"You stayed beside me like the rock you are until I unearthed the plant, followed it back through every fibre of its pattern to its last and tiniest enrootment in the blind, dumb earth. And now that it is finished, and the circle come full swing--we, too, are finished, and I have a thing to say:  I believe that we are lost here in America, but I believe we shall be found. And this belief, which mounts now to the catharsis of knowledge and conviction, is for me--and I think for all of us----not only our own hope, but America's everlasting, living dream. I think the life which we have fashioned in America, and which has fashioned us--the forms we made, the cells that grew, the honeycomb that was created--was self-destructive in its nature, and must be destroyed. I think these forms are dying, and must die, just as I know that America and the people in it are deathless, undiscovered, and immortal, and must live.",1
5536,"I think the true discovery of America is before us. I think the true fulfilment of our spirit, of our people, of our mighty and immortal land, is yet to come. I think the true discovery of our own democracy is still before us. And I think that all these things are certain as the morning, as inevitable as noon. I think I speak for most men living when I say that our America is Here, is Now, and beckons on before us, and that this glorious assurance is not only our living hope, but our dream to be accomplished.",1
5537,"I think the enemy is here before us, too. But I think we know the forms and faces of the enemy, and in the knowledge that we know him, and shall meet him, and eventually must conquer him is also our living hope. I think the enemy is here before us with a thousand faces, but I think we know that all his faces wear one mask. I think the enemy is single selfishness and compulsive greed. I think the enemy is blind, but has the brutal power of his blind grab. I do not think the enemy was born yesterday, or that he grew to manhood forty years ago, or that he suffered sickness and collapse in 1929, or that we began without the enemy, and that our vision faltered, that we lost the way, and suddenly were in his camp. I think the enemy is old as Time, and evil as Hell, and that he has been here with us from the beginning. I think he stole our earth from us, destroyed our wealth, and ravaged and despoiled our land. I think he took our people and enslaved them, that he polluted the fountains of our life, took unto himself the rarest treasures of our own possession, took our bread and left us with a crust, and, not content, for the nature of the enemy is insatiate--tried finally to take from us the crust.",1
5538,"I think the enemy comes to us with the face of innocence and says to us:  ""I am your friend. I think the enemy deceives us with false words and lying phrases, saying:  ""See, I am one of you--I am one of your children, your son, your brother, and your friend. Behold how sleek and fat I have become--and all because I am just one of you, and your friend. Behold how rich and powerful I am--and all because I am one of you--shaped in your way of life, of thinking, of accomplishment. What I am, I am because I am one of you, your humble brother and your friend. Behold,"" cries Enemy, ""the man I am, the man I have become, the thing I have accomplished--and reflect. Will you destroy this thing? I assure you that it is the most precious thing you have. It is yourselves, the projection of each of you, the triumph of your individual lives, the thing that is rooted in your blood, and native to your stock, and inherent in the traditions of America. It is the thing that all of you may hope to be,"" says Enemy, ""for""--humbly--""am I not just one of you? Am I not just your brother and your son? Am I not the living image of what each of you may hope to be, would wish to be, would desire for his own son? Would you destroy this glorious incarnation of your own heroic self? If you do, then,"" says Enemy, ""you destroy yourselves--you kill the thing that is most gloriously American, and in so killing, kill yourselves. He lies!",1
5539,"And now we know he lies! He is not gloriously, or in any other way, ourselves. He is not our friend, our son, our brother. And he is not American! For, although he has a thousand familiar and convenient faces, his own true face is old as Hell.",1
5540,"Look about you and see what he has done. Dear Fox, old friend, thus we have come to the end of the road that we were to go together. My tale is finished--and so farewell.",1
5541,"But before I go, I have just one more thing to tell you:  Something has spoken to me in the night, burning the tapers of the waning year; something has spoken in the night, and told me I shall die, I know not where. Saying:  ""To lose the earth you know, for greater knowing; to lose the life you have, for greater life; to leave the friends you loved, for greater loving; to find a land more kind than home, more large than earth----  ""--Whereon the pillars of this earth are founded, towards which the conscience of the world is tending--a wind is rising, and the rivers flow.",1
5542,"PART ONE   [1] In the town there were two mutes, and they were always together. Early every morning they would come out from the house where they lived and walk arm in arm down the street to work. The two friends were very different. The one who always steered the way was an obese and dreamy Greek. In the summer he would come out wearing a yellow or green polo shirt stuffed sloppily into his trousers in front and hanging loose behind. When it was colder he wore over this a shapeless gray sweater. His face was round and oily, with half-closed eyelids and lips that curved in a gentle, stupid smile. The other mute was tall. His eyes had a quick, intelligent expression. He was always immaculate and very soberly dressed.",0
5543,"Every morning the two friends walked silently together until they reached the main street of the town. Then when they came to a certain fruit and candy store they paused for a moment on the sidewalk outside. The Greek, Spiros Antonapoulos, worked for his cousin, who owned this fruit store. His job was to make candies and sweets, uncrate the fruits, and to keep the place clean. The thin mute, John Singer, nearly always put his hand on his friend's arm and looked for a second into his face before leaving him. Then after this good-bye Singer crossed the street and walked on alone to the jewelry store where he worked as a silverware engraver.",0
5544,"In the late afternoon the friends would meet again. Singer came back to the fruit store and waited until Antonapoulos was ready to go home. The Greek would be lazily unpacking a case of peaches or melons, or perhaps looking at the funny paper in the kitchen behind the store where he cooked. Before their departure Antonapoulos always opened a paper sack he kept hidden during the day on one of the kitchen shelves. Inside were stored various bits of food he had collected--a piece of fruit, samples of candy, or the butt-end of a liverwurst. Usually before leaving Antonapoulos waddled gently to the glassed case in the front of the store where some meats and cheeses were kept. He glided open the back of the case and his fat hand groped lovingly for some particular dainty inside which he had wanted. Sometimes his cousin who owned the place did not see him. But if he noticed he stared at his cousin with a warning in his tight, pale face. Sadly Antonapoulos would shuffle the morsel from one corner of the case to the other. During these times Singer stood very straight with his hands in his pockets and looked in another direction. He did not like to watch this little scene between the two Greeks. For, excepting drinking and a certain solitary secret pleasure, Antonapoulos loved to eat more than anything else in the world.",0
5545,"In the dusk the two mutes walked slowly home together. At home Singer was always talking to Antonapoulos. His hands shaped the words in a swift series of designs. His face was eager and his gray-green eyes sparkled brightly. With his thin, strong hands he told Antonapoulos all that had happened during the day.",0
5546,"Antonapoulos sat back lazily and looked at Singer. It was seldom that he ever moved his hands to speak at all--and then it was to say that he wanted to eat or to sleep or to drink. These three things he always said with the same vague, fumbling signs. At night, if he were not too drunk, he would kneel down before his bed and pray awhile. Then his plump hands shaped the words 'Holy Jesus,' or 'God,' or 'Darling Mary.' These were the only words Antonapoulos ever said. Singer never knew just how much his friend understood of all the things he told him. But it did not matter.",0
5547,"They shared the upstairs of a small house near the business section of the town. There were two rooms. On the oil stove in the kitchen Antonapoulos cooked all of their meals. There were straight, plain kitchen chairs for Singer and an over-stuffed sofa for Antonapoulos. The bedroom was furnished mainly with a large double bed covered with an eiderdown comfort for the big Greek and a narrow iron cot for Singer.",0
5548,"Dinner always took a long time, because Antonapoulos loved food and he was very slow. After they had eaten, the big Greek would lie back on his sofa and slowly lick over each one of his teeth with his tongue, either from a certain delicacy or because he did not wish to lose the savor of the meal--while Singer washed the dishes. Sometimes in the evening the mutes would play chess. Singer had always greatly enjoyed this game, and years before he had tried to teach it to Antonapoulos. At first his friend could not be interested in the reasons for moving the various pieces about on the board. Then Singer began to keep a bottle of something good under the table to be taken out after each lesson. The Greek never got on to the erratic movements of the knights and the sweeping mobility of the queens, but he learned to make a few set, opening moves. He preferred the white pieces and would not play if the black men were given him. After the first moves Singer worked out the game by himself while his friend looked on drowsily. If Singer made brilliant attacks on his own men so that in the end the black king was killed, Antonapoulos was always very proud and pleased.",0
5549,"The two mutes had no other friends, and except when they worked they were alone together. Each day was very much like any other day, because they were alone so much that nothing ever disturbed them. Once a week they would go to the library for Singer to withdraw a mystery book and on Friday night they attended a movie. Then on payday they always went to the ten-cent photograph shop above the Army and Navy Store so that Antonapoulos could have his picture taken. These were the only places where they made customary visits. There were many parts in the town that they had never even seen.",0
5550,"The town was in the middle of the deep South. The summers were long and the months of winter cold were very few. Nearly always the sky was a glassy, brilliant azure and the sun burned down riotously bright. Then the light, chill rains of November would come, and perhaps later there would be frost and some short months of cold. The winters were changeable, but the summers always were burning hot. The town was a fairly large one. On the main street there were several blocks of two- and three-story shops and business offices. But the largest buildings in the town were the factories, which employed a large percentage of the population. These cotton mills were big and flourishing and most of the workers in the town were very poor. Often in the faces along the streets there was the desperate look of hunger and of loneliness.",0
5551,"But the two mutes were not lonely at all. At home they were content to eat and drink, and Singer would talk with his hands eagerly to his friend about all that was in his mind. So the years passed in this quiet way until Singer reached the age of thirty-two and had been in the town with Antonapoulos for ten years.",0
5552,"Then one day the Greek became ill. He sat up in bed with his hands on his fat stomach and big, oily tears rolled down his cheeks. Singer went to see his friend's cousin who owned the fruit store, and also he arranged for leave from his own work. The doctor made out a diet for Antonapoulos and said that he could drink no more wine. Singer rigidly enforced the doctor's orders. All day he sat by his friend's bed and did what he could to make the time pass quickly, but Antonapoulos only looked at him angrily from the corners of his eyes and would not be amused.",0
5553,"The Greek was very fretful, and kept finding fault with the fruit drinks and food that Singer prepared for him. Constantly he made his friend help him out of bed so that he could pray. His huge buttocks would sag down over his plump little feet when he kneeled. He fumbled with his hands to say 'Darling Mary' and then held to the small brass cross tied to his neck with a dirty string. His big eyes would wall up to the ceiling with a look of fear in them, and afterward he was very sulky and would not let his friend speak to him.",0
5554,"Singer was patient and did all that he could. He drew little pictures, and once he made a sketch of his friend to amuse him. This picture hurt the big Greek's feelings, and he refused to be reconciled until Singer had made his face very young and handsome and colored his hair bright yellow and his eyes china blue. And then he tried not to show his pleasure.",0
5555,Singer nursed his friend so carefully that after a week Antonapoulos was able to return to his work. But from that time on there was a difference in their way of life. Trouble came to the two friends.,0
5556,"Antonapoulos was not ill any more, but a change had come in him. He was irritable and no longer content to spend the evenings quietly in their home. When he would wish to go out Singer followed along close behind him. Antonapoulos would go into a restaurant, and while they sat at the table he slyly put lumps of sugar, or a pepper-shaker, or pieces of silverware in his pocket. Singer always paid for what he took and there was no disturbance. At home he scolded Antonapoulos, but the big Greek only looked at him with a bland smile.",0
5557,"The months went on and these habits of Antonapoulos grew worse. One day at noon he walked calmly out of the fruit store of his cousin and urinated in public against the wall of the First National Bank Building across the street. At times he would meet people on the sidewalk whose faces did not please him, and he would bump into these persons and push at them with his elbows and stomach. He walked into a store one day and hauled out a floor lamp without paying for it, and another time he tried to take an electric train he had seen in a showcase.",0
5558,"For Singer this was a time of great distress. He was continually marching Antonapoulos down to the courthouse during lunch hour to settle these infringements of the law. Singer became very familiar with the procedure of the courts and he was in a constant state of agitation. The money he had saved in the bank was spent for bail and fines. All of his efforts and money were used to keep his friend out of jail because of such charges as theft, committing public indecencies, and assault and battery.",0
5559,"The Greek cousin for whom Antonapoulos worked did not enter into these troubles at all. Charles Parker (for that was the name this cousin had taken) let Antonapoulos stay on at the store, but he watched him always with his pale, tight face and he made no effort to help him. Singer had a strange feeling about Charles Parker. He began to dislike him.",0
5560,"Singer lived in continual turmoil and worry. But Antonapoulos was always bland, and no matter what happened the gentle, flaccid smile was still on his face. In all the years before it had seemed to Singer that there was something very subtle and wise in this smile of his friend. He had never known just how much Antonapoulos understood and what he was thinking. Now in the big Greek's expression Singer thought that he could detect something sly and joking. He would shake his friend by the shoulders until he was very tired and explain things over and over with his hands. But nothing did any good.",0
5561,All of Singer's money was gone and he had to borrow from the jeweler for whom he worked. On one occasion he was unable to pay bail for his friend and Antonapoulos spent the night in jail. When Singer came to get him out the next day he was very sulky. He did not want to leave. He had enjoyed his dinner of sowbelly and cornbread with syrup poured over it. And the new sleeping arrangements and his cellmates pleased him.,0
5562,"They had lived so much alone that Singer had no one to help him in his distress. Antonapoulos let nothing disturb him or cure him of his habits. At home he sometimes cooked the new dish he had eaten in the jail, and on the streets there was never any knowing just what he would do.",0
5563,And then the final trouble came to Singer. One afternoon he had come to meet Antonapoulos at the fruit store when Charles Parker handed him a letter. The letter explained that Charles Parker had made arrangements for his cousin to be taken to the state insane asylum two hundred miles away. Charles Parker had used his influence in the town and the details were already settled. Antonapoulos was to leave and to be admitted into the asylum the next week.,0
5564,"Singer read the letter several times, and for a while he could not think. Charles Parker was talking to him across the counter, but he did not even try to read his lips and understand. At last Singer wrote on the little pad he always carried in his pocket:  You cannot do this.",0
5565,"Antonapoulos must stay with me. Charles Parker shook his head excitedly. He did not know much American. 'None of your business,' he kept saying over and over.",0
5566,"Singer knew that everything was finished. The Greek was afraid that some day he might be responsible for his cousin. Charles Parker did not know much about the American language--but he understood the American dollar very well, and he had used his money and influence to admit his cousin to the asylum without delay.",0
5567,"There was nothing Singer could do. The next week was full of feverish activity. He talked and talked. And although his hands never paused to rest he could not tell all that he had to say. He wanted to talk to Antonapoulos of all the thoughts that had ever been in his mind and heart, but there was not time. His gray eyes glittered and his quick, intelligent face expressed great strain. Antonapoulos watched him drowsily, and his friend did not know just what he really understood.",0
5568,"Then came the day when Antonapoulos must leave. Singer brought out his own suitcase and very carefully packed the best of their joint possessions. Antonapoulos made himself a lunch to eat during the journey. In the late afternoon they walked arm in arm down the street for the last time together. It was a chilly afternoon in late November, and little huffs of breath showed in the air before them.",0
5569,"Charles Parker was to travel with his cousin, but he stood apart from them at the station. Antonapoulos crowded into the bus and settled himself with elaborate preparations on one of the front seats. Singer watched him from the window and his hands began desperately to talk for the last time with his friend. But Antonapoulos was so busy checking over the various items in his lunch box that for a while he paid no attention. Just before the bus pulled away from the curb he turned to Singer and his smile was very bland and remote--as though already they were many miles apart.",0
5570,"The weeks that followed did not seem real at all. All day Singer worked over his bench in the back of the jewelry store, and then at night he returned to the house alone. More than anything he wanted to sleep. As soon as he came home from work he would lie on his cot and try to doze awhile. Dreams came to him when he lay there half-asleep. And in all of them Antonapoulos was there. His hands would jerk nervously, for in his dreams he was talking to his friend and Antonapoulos was watching him.",0
5571,Singer tried to think of the time before he had ever known his friend. He tried to recount to himself certain things that had happened when he was young. But none of these things he tried to remember seemed real.,0
5572,"There was one particular fact that he remembered, but it was not at all important to him. Singer recalled that, although he had been deaf since he was an infant, he had not always been a real mute. He was left an orphan very young and placed in an institution for the deaf. He had learned to talk with his hands and to read. Before he was nine years old he could talk with one hand in the American way--and also could employ both of his hands after the method of Europeans. He had learned to follow the movements of people's lips and to understand what they said. Then finally he had been taught to speak.",0
5573,"At the school he was thought very intelligent. He learned the lessons before the rest of the pupils. But he could never become used to speaking with his lips. It was not natural to him, and his tongue felt like a whale in his mouth. From the blank expression on people's faces to whom he talked in this way he felt that his voice must be like the sound of some animal or that there was something disgusting in his speech. It was painful for him to try to talk with his mouth, but his hands were always ready to shape the words he wished to say. When he was twenty-two he had come South to this town from Chicago and he met Antonapoulos immediately. Since that time he had never spoken with his mouth again, because with his friend there was no need for this.",0
5574,"Nothing seemed real except the ten years with Antonapoulos. In his half-dreams he saw his friend very vividly, and when he awakened a great aching loneliness would be in him. Occasionally he would pack up a box for Antonapoulos, but he never received any reply. And so the months passed in this empty, dreaming way.",0
5575,"In the spring a change came over Singer. He could not sleep and his body was very restless. At evening he would walk monotonously around the room, unable to work off a new feeling of energy. If he rested at all it was only during a few hours before dawn--then he would drop bluntly into a sleep that lasted until the morning light struck suddenly beneath his opening eyelids like a scimitar.",0
5576,"He began spending his evenings walking around the town. He could no longer stand the rooms where Antonapoulos had lived, and he rented a place in a shambling boarding-house not far from the center of the town. He ate his meals at a restaurant only two blocks away. This restaurant was at the very end of the long main street, and the name of the place was the New York Café. The first day he glanced over the menu quickly and wrote a short note and handed it to the proprietor.",0
5577,"Each morning for breakfast I want an egg, toast, and coffee-- $0.15 Lunch I want soup (any kind), a meat sandwich, and milk-- $0.25 Please bring me at dinner three vegetables (any kind but cabbage), fish or meat, and a glass of beer-- $0.35  Thank you. The proprietor read the note and gave him an alert, tactful glance. He was a hard man of middle height, with a beard so dark and heavy that the lower part of his face looked as though it were molded of iron. He usually stood in the corner by the cash register, his arms folded over his chest, quietly observing all that went on around him. Singer came to know this man's face very well, for he ate at one of his tables three times a day.",0
5578,"Each evening the mute walked alone for hours in the street. Sometimes the nights were cold with the sharp, wet winds of March and it would be raining heavily. But to him this did not matter. His gait was agitated and he always kept his hands stuffed tight into the pockets of his trousers. Then as the weeks passed the days grew warm and languorous. His agitation gave way gradually to exhaustion and there was a look about him of deep calm. In his face there came to be a brooding peace that is seen most often in the faces of the very sorrowful or the very wise. But still he wandered through the streets of the town, always silent and alone.",0
5579,"[2] On a black, sultry night in early summer Biff Brannon stood behind the cash register of the New York Café. It was twelve o'clock. Outside the street lights had already been turned off, so that the light from the café made a sharp, yellow rectangle on the sidewalk. The street was deserted, but inside the café there were half a dozen customers drinking beer or Santa Lucia wine or whiskey. Biff waited stolidly, his elbow resting on the counter and his thumb mashing the tip of his long nose. His eyes were intent. He watched especially a short, squat man in overalls who had become drunk and boisterous. Now and then his gaze passed on to the mute who sat by himself at one of the middle tables, or to others of the customers before the counter. But he always turned back to the drunk in overalls. The hour grew later and Biff continued to wait silently behind the counter. Then at last he gave the restaurant a final survey and went toward the door at the back which led upstairs.",0
5580,Quietly he entered the room at the top of the stairs. It was dark inside and he walked with caution. After he had gone a few paces his toe struck something hard and he reached down and felt for the handle of a suitcase on the floor. He had only been in the room a few seconds and was about to leave when the light was turned on.,0
5581,Alice sat up in the rumpled bed and looked at him. 'What you doing with that suitcase?' she asked. 'Can't you get rid of that lunatic without giving him back what he's already drunk up?'  'Wake up and go down yourself.,0
5582,"Call the cop and let him get soused on the chain gang with cornbread and peas. Go to it, Missis Brannon.' 'I will all right if he's down there tomorrow. But you leave that bag alone. It don't belong to that sponger any more.'",0
5583,"'I know spongers, and Blount's not one,' Biff said. 'Myself--I don't know so well. But I'm not that kind of a thief. '",0
5584,Calmly Biff put down the suitcase on the steps outside. The air was not so stale and sultry in the room as it was downstairs. He decided to stay for a short while and douse his face with cold water before going back.,0
5585,"'I told you already what I'll do if you don't get rid of that fellow for good tonight. In the daytime he takes them naps at the back, and then at night you feed him dinners and beer. For a week now he hasn't paid one cent. And all his wild talking and carrying-on will ruin any decent trade. '",0
5586,"'You don't know people and you don't know real business,' Biff said. 'The fellow in question first came in here twelve days ago and he was a stranger in the town. The first week he gave us twenty dollars' worth of trade. Twenty at the minimum.'",0
5587,"'And since then on credit,' Alice said. 'Five days on credit, and so drunk it's a disgrace to the business. And besides, he's nothing but a bum and a freak. '",0
5588,"'I like freaks,' Biff said. 'I reckon you do! I just reckon you certainly ought to, Mister Brannon--being as you're one yourself.'",0
5589,"He rubbed his bluish chin and paid her no attention. For the first fifteen years of their married life they had called each other just plain Biff and Alice. Then in one of their quarrels they had begun calling each other Mister and Missis, and since then they had never made it up enough to change it.",0
5590,"'I'm just warning you he'd better not be there when I come down tomorrow. ' Biff went into the bathroom, and after he had bathed his face he decided that he would have time for a shave. His beard was black and heavy as though it had grown for three days. He stood before the mirror and rubbed his cheek meditatively. He was sorry he had talked to Alice. With her, silence was better. Being around that woman always made him different from his real self. It made him tough and small and common as she was. Biff's eyes were cold and staring, half-concealed by the cynical droop of his eyelids. On the fifth finger of his calloused hand there was a woman's wedding ring. The door was open behind him, and in the mirror he could see Alice lying in the bed.",0
5591,"'Listen,' he said. ' The trouble with you is that you don't have any real kindness. Not but one woman I've ever known had this real kindness I'm talking about.'",0
5592,"'Well, I've known you to do things no man in this world would be proud of. I've known you to----'  ' Or maybe it's curiosity I mean. You don't ever see or notice anything important that goes on. You never watch and think and try to figure anything out. Maybe that's the biggest difference between you and me, after all. '",0
5593,"Alice was almost asleep again, and through the mirror he watched her with detachment. There was no distinctive point about her on which he could fasten his attention, and his gaze glided from her pale brown hair to the stumpy outline of her feet beneath the cover. The soft curves of her face led to the roundness of her hips and thighs. When he was away from her there was no one feature that stood out in his mind and he remembered her as a complete, unbroken figure.",0
5594,"'The enjoyment of a spectacle is something you have never known,' he said. Her voice was tired. 'That fellow downstairs is a spectacle, all right, and a circus too. But I'm through putting up with him.'",0
5595,"'Hell, the man don't mean anything to me. He's no relative or buddy of mine. But you don't know what it is to store up a whole lot of details and then come upon something real.' He turned on the hot water and quickly began to shave.",0
5596,"It was the morning of May 15, yes, that Jake Blount had come in. He had noticed him immediately and watched. The man was short, with heavy shoulders like beams. He had a small, ragged mustache, and beneath this his lower lip looked as though it had been stung by a wasp. There were many things about the fellow that seemed contrary. His head was very large and well-shaped, but his neck was soft and slender as a boy's. The mustache looked false, as if it had been stuck on for a costume party and would fall off if he talked too fast. It made him seem almost middle-aged, although his face with its high, smooth forehead and wide-open eyes was young. His hands were huge, stained, and calloused, and he was dressed in a cheap white-linen suit. There was something very funny about the man, yet at the same time another feeling would not let you laugh.",0
5597,"He ordered a pint of liquor and drank it straight in half an hour. Then he sat at one of the booths and ate a big chicken dinner. Later he read a book and drank beer. That was the beginning. And although Biff had noticed Blount very carefully he would never have guessed about the crazy things that happened later. Never had he seen a man change so many times in twelve days. Never had he seen a fellow drink so much, stay drunk so long.",0
5598,Biff pushed up the end of his nose with his thumb and shaved his upper lip. He was finished and his face seemed cooler. Alice was asleep when he went through the bedroom on the way downstairs.,0
5599,"The suitcase was heavy. He carried it to the front of the restaurant, behind the cash register, where he usually stood each evening. Methodically he glanced around the place. A few customers had left and the room was not so crowded, but the set-up was the same. The deaf-mute still drank coffee by himself at one of the middle tables. The drunk had not stopped talking. He was not addressing anyone around him in particular, nor was anyone listening. When he had come into the place that evening he wore those blue overalls instead of the filthy linen suit he had been wearing the twelve days. His socks were gone and his ankles were scratched and caked with mud.",0
5600,"Alertly Biff picked up fragments of his monologue. The fellow seemed to be talking some queer kind of politics again. Last night he had been talking about places he had been--about Texas and Oklahoma and the Carolinas. Once he had got on the subject of cat-houses, and afterward his jokes got so raw he had to be hushed up with beer. But most of the time nobody was sure just what he was saying. Talk--talk--talk. The words came out of his throat like a cataract. And the thing was that the accent he used was always changing, the kinds of words he used. Sometimes he talked like a linthead and sometimes like a professor. He would use words a foot long and then slip up on his grammar. It was hard to tell what kind of folks he had or what part of the country he was from. He was always changing. Thoughtfully Biff fondled the tip of his nose. There was no connection. Yet connection usually went with brains. This man had a good mind, all right, but he went from one thing to another without any reason behind it at all. He was like a man thrown off his track by something.",0
5601,"Biff leaned his weight on the counter and began to peruse the evening newspaper. The headlines told of a decision by the Board of Aldermen, after four months' deliberation, that the local budget could not afford traffic lights at certain dangerous intersections of the town. The left column reported on the war in the Orient. Biff read them both with equal attention. As his eyes followed the print the rest of his senses were on the alert to the various commotions that went on around him. When he had finished the articles he still stared down at the newspaper with his eyes half-closed. He felt nervous. The fellow was a problem, and before morning he would have to make some sort of settlement with him. Also, he felt without knowing why that something of importance would happen tonight. The fellow could not keep on forever.",0
5602,"Biff sensed that someone was standing in the entrance and he raised his eyes quickly. A gangling, towheaded youngster, a girl of about twelve, stood looking in the doorway. She was dressed in khaki shorts, a blue shirt, and tennis shoes--so that at first glance she was like a very young boy. Biff pushed aside the paper when he saw her, and smiled when she came up to him.",0
5603,"'Hello, Mick. Been to the Girl Scouts?'  'No,' she said. 'I don't belong to them.'",0
5604,From the corner of his eye he noticed that the drunk slammed his fist down on a table and turned away from the men to whom he had been talking. Biff's voice roughened as he spoke to the youngster before him. 'Your folks know you're out after midnight?'  'It's O.K.,0
5605,"There's a gang of kids playing out late on our block tonight. ' He had never seen her come into the place with anyone her own age. Several years ago she had always tagged behind her older brother. The Kellys were a good-sized family in numbers. Later she would come in pulling a couple of snotty babies in a wagon. But if she wasn't nursing or trying to keep up with the bigger ones, she was by herself. Now the kid stood there seeming not to be able to make up her mind what she wanted. She kept pushing back her damp, whitish hair with the palm of her hand.",0
5606,"'I'd like a pack of cigarettes, please. The cheapest kind.' Biff started to speak, hesitated, and then reached his hand inside the counter. Mick brought out a handkerchief and began untying the knot in the corner where she kept her money. As she gave the knot a jerk the change clattered to the floor and rolled toward Blount, who stood muttering to himself. For a moment he stared in a daze at the coins, but before the kid could go after them he squatted down with concentration and picked up the money. He walked heavily to the counter and stood jiggling the two pennies, the nickel, and the dime in his palm.",0
5607,"'Seventeen cents for cigarettes now?'  Biff waited, and Mick looked from one of them to the other. The drunk stacked the money into a little pile on the counter, still protecting it with his big, dirty hand. Slowly he picked up one penny and flipped it down.",0
5608,"'Five mills for the crackers who grew the weed and five for the dupes who rolled it,' he said. 'A cent for you, Biff.' Then he tried to focus his eyes so that he could read the mottoes on the nickel and dime. He kept fingering the two coins and moving them around in a circle. At last he pushed them away. ' And that's a humble homage to liberty. To democracy and tyranny. To freedom and piracy.'  Calmly Biff picked up the money and rang it into the till.",0
5609,"Mick looked as though she wanted to hang around awhile. She took in the drunk with one long gaze, and then she turned her eyes to the middle of the room where the mute sat at his table alone. After a moment Blount also glanced now and then in the same direction. The mute sat silently over his glass of beer, idly drawing on the table with the end of a burnt matchstick.",0
5610,"Jake Blount was the first to speak. 'It's funny, but I been seeing that fellow in my sleep for the past three or four nights. He won't leave me alone. If you ever noticed, he never seems to say anything. '",0
5611,"It was seldom that Biff ever discussed one customer with another. 'No, he don't,' he answered noncommittally. 'It's funny.'",0
5612,"Mick shifted her weight from one foot to the other and fitted the package of cigarettes into the pocket of her shorts. 'It's not funny if you know anything about him,' she said. 'Mister Singer lives with us. He rooms in our house.'",0
5613,'Is that so?' Biff asked. 'I declare--I didn't know that. ',0
5614,Mick walked toward the door and answered him without looking around. 'Sure. He's been with us three months now. ',0
5615,Biff unrolled his shirt-sleeves and then folded them up carefully again. He did not take his eyes away from Mick as she left the restaurant. And even after she had been gone several minutes he still fumbled with his shirt-sleeves and stared at the empty doorway. Then he locked his arms across his chest and turned back to the drunk again.,0
5616,Blount leaned heavily on the counter. His brown eyes were wet-looking and wide open with a dazed expression. He needed a bath so badly that he stank like a goat. There were dirt beads on his sweaty neck and an oil stain on his face. His lips were thick and red and his brown hair was matted on his forehead. His overalls were too short in the body and he kept pulling at the crotch of them.,0
5617,"'Man, you ought to know better,' Biff said finally. 'You can't go around like this. Why, I'm surprised you haven't been picked up for vagrancy. You ought to sober up. You need washing and your hair needs cutting. Motherogod! You're not fit to walk around amongst people. '",0
5618,"Blount scowled and bit his lower lip. 'Now, don't take offense and get your dander up. Do what I tell you. Go back in the kitchen and tell the colored boy to give you a big pan of hot water. Tell Willie to give you a towel and plenty soap and wash yourself good. Then eat you some milk toast and open up your suitcase and put you on a clean shirt and a pair of britches that fit you. Then tomorrow you can start doing whatever you're going to do and working wherever you mean to work and get straightened out.'",0
5619,"'You know what you can do,' Blount said drunkenly. 'You can just----'  'All right,' Biff said very quietly. 'No, I can't. Now you just behave yourself. '",0
5620,"Biff went to the end of the counter and returned with two glasses of draught beer. The drunk picked up his glass so clumsily that beer slopped down on his hands and messed the counter. Biff sipped his portion with careful relish. He regarded Blount steadily with half-closed eyes. Blount was not a freak, although when you first saw him he gave you that impression. It was like something was deformed about him--but when you looked at him closely each part of him was normal and as it ought to be. Therefore if this difference was not in the body it was probably in the mind. He was like a man who had served a term in prison or had been to Harvard College or had lived for a long time with foreigners in South America. He was like a person who had been somewhere that other people are not likely to go or had done something that others are not apt to do.",0
5621,"Biff cocked his head to one side and said, 'Where are you from?'  'Nowhere.' 'Now, you have to be born somewhere. North Carolina--Tennessee--Alabama--some place. '",0
5622,"Blount's eyes were dreamy and unfocused. 'Carolina,' he said. 'I can tell you've been around,' Biff hinted delicately.",0
5623,"But the drunk was not listening. He had turned from the counter and was staring out at the dark, empty street. After a moment he walked to the door with loose, uncertain steps.",0
5624,"'Adios,' he called back. Biff was alone again and he gave the restaurant one of his quick, thorough surveys. It was past one in the morning, and there were only four or five customers in the room. The mute still sat by himself at the middle table. Biff stared at him idly and shook the few remaining drops of beer around in the bottom of his glass. Then he finished his drink in one slow swallow and went back to the newspaper spread out on the counter.",0
5625,"This time he could not keep his mind on the words before him. He remembered Mick. He wondered if he should have sold her the pack of cigarettes and if it were really harmful for kids to smoke. He thought of the way Mick narrowed her eyes and pushed back the bangs of her hair with the palm of her hand. He thought of her hoarse, boyish voice and of her habit of hitching up her khaki shorts and swaggering like a cowboy in the picture show. A feeling of tenderness came in him. He was uneasy.",0
5626,"Restlessly Biff turned his attention to Singer. The mute sat with his hands in his pockets and the half-finished glass of beer before him had become warm and stagnant. He would offer to treat Singer to a slug of whiskey before he left. What he had said to Alice was true--he did like freaks. He had a special friendly feeling for sick people and cripples. Whenever somebody with a harelip or T.B. came into the place he would set him up to beer. Or if the customer were a hunchback or a bad cripple, then it would be whiskey on the house. There was one fellow who had had his peter and his left leg blown off in a boiler explosion, and whenever he came to town there was a free pint waiting for him. And if Singer were a drinking kind of man he could get liquor at half price any time he wanted it. Biff nodded to himself. Then neatly he folded his newspaper and put it under the counter along with several others. At the end of the week he would take them all back to the storeroom behind the kitchen, where he kept a complete file of the evening newspaper that dated back without a break for twenty-one years.",0
5627,"At two o'clock Blount entered the restaurant again. He brought in with him a tall Negro man carrying a black bag. The drunk tried to bring him up to the counter for a drink, but the Negro left as soon as he realized why he had been led inside. Biff recognized him as a Negro doctor who had practiced in the town ever since he could remember. He was related in some way to young Willie back in the kitchen. Before he left Biff saw him turn on Blount with a look of quivering hatred.",0
5628,The drunk just stood there. 'Don't you know you can't bring no nigger in a place where white men drink?' someone asked him.,0
5629,"Biff watched this happening from a distance. Blount was very angry, and now it could easily be seen how drunk he was. 'I'm part nigger myself,' he called out as a challenge.",0
5630,Biff watched him alertly and the place was quiet. With his thick nostrils and the rolling whites of his eyes it looked a little as though he might be telling the truth. 'I'm part nigger and wop and bohunk and chink. All of those.'  There was laughter.,0
5631,"'And I'm Dutch and Turkish and Japanese and American.' He walked in zigzags around the table where the mute drank his coffee. His voice was loud and cracked. 'I'm one who knows. I'm a stranger in a strange land. '  'Quiet down,' Biff said to him.",0
5632,Blount paid no attention to anyone in the place except the mute. They were both looking at each other. The mute's eyes were cold and gentle as a cat's and all his body seemed to listen. The drunk man was in a frenzy.,0
5633,"'You're the only one in this town who catches what I mean,' Blount said. 'For two days now I been talking to you in my mind because I know you understand the things I want to mean.' Some people in a booth were laughing because without knowing it the drunk had picked out a deaf-mute to try to talk with. Biff watched the two men with little darting glances and listened attentively.",0
5634,Blount sat down to the table and leaned over close to Singer. 'There are those who know and those who don't know. And for every ten thousand who don't know there's only one who knows. That's the miracle of all time--the fact that these millions know so much but don't know this. It's like in the fifteenth century when everybody believed the world was flat and only Columbus and a few other fellows knew the truth. But it's different in that it took talent to figure that the earth is round. While this truth is so obvious it's a miracle of all history that people don't know. You savvy. ',0
5635,Biff rested his elbows on the counter and looked at Blount with curiosity. 'Know what?' he asked.,0
5636,"'Don't listen to him,' Blount said. 'Don't mind that flat-footed, blue-jawed, nosy bastard. For you see, when us people who know run into each other that's an event. It almost never happens. Sometimes we meet each other and neither guesses that the other is one who knows. That's a bad thing. It's happened to me a lot of times. But you see there are so few of us.'",0
5637,"'Masons?' Biff asked. 'Shut up, you! Else I'll snatch your arm off and beat you black with it,' Blount bawled. He hunched over close to the mute and his voice dropped to a drunken whisper. ' And how come? Why has this miracle of ignorance endured? Because of one thing. A conspiracy. A vast and insidious conspiracy. Obscurantism. '",0
5638,"The men in the booth were still laughing at the drunk who was trying to hold a conversation with the mute. Only Biff was serious. He wanted to ascertain if the mute really understood what was said to him. The fellow nodded frequently and his face seemed contemplative. He was only slow--that was all. Blount began to crack a few jokes along with this talk about knowing. The mute never smiled until several seconds after the funny remark had been made; then when the talk was gloomy again the smile still hung on his face a little too long. The fellow was downright uncanny. People felt themselves watching him even before they knew that there was anything different about him. His eyes made a person think that he heard things nobody else had ever heard, that he knew things no one had ever guessed before. He did not seem quite human.",0
5639,"Jake Blount leaned across the table and the words came out as though a dam inside him had broken. Biff could not understand him any more. Blount's tongue was so heavy with drink and he talked at such a violent pace that the sounds were all shaken up together. Biff wondered where he would go when Alice turned him out of the place. And in the morning she would do it, too--like she said.",0
5640,"Biff yawned wanly, patting his open mouth with his fingertips until his jaw had relaxed. It was almost three o'clock, the most stagnant hour in the day or night. The mute was patient. He had been listening to Blount for almost an hour. Now he began to look at the clock occasionally. Blount did not notice this and went on without a pause. At last he stopped to roll a cigarette, and then the mute nodded his head in the direction of the clock, smiled in that hidden way of his, and got up from the table. His hands stayed stuffed in his pockets as always. He went out quickly.",0
5641,Blount was so drunk that he did not know what had happened. He had never even caught on to the fact that the mute made no answers. He began to look around the place with his mouth open and his eyes rolling and fuddled. A red vein stood out on his forehead and he began to hit the table angrily with his fists. His bout could not last much longer now.,0
5642,"'Come on over,' Biff said kindly. 'Your friend has gone.' The fellow was still hunting for Singer. He had never seemed really drunk like that before. He had an ugly look.",0
5643,"'I have something for you over here and I want to speak with you a minute,' Biff coaxed. Blount pulled himself up from the table and walked with big, loose steps toward the street again. Biff leaned against the wall. In and out--in and out. After all, it was none of his business. The room was very empty and quiet. The minutes lingered. Wearily he let his head sag forward. All motion seemed slowly to be leaving the room. The counter, faces, the booths and tables, the radio in the corner, whirring fans on the ceiling--all seemed to become very faint and still.",0
5644,"He must have dozed. A hand was shaking his elbow. His wits came back to him slowly and he looked up to see what was wanted. Willie, the colored boy in the kitchen, stood before him dressed in his cap and his long white apron. Willie stammered because he was excited about whatever he was trying to say.",0
5645,' And so he were l-l-lamming his fist against this here brick w-w-w-all.' 'What's that?',0
5646,'Right down one of them alleys two d-d-doors away. ' Biff straightened his slumped shoulders and arranged his tie. ' What?',0
5647,"'And they means to bring him in here and they liable to pile in any minute----'  'Willie,' Biff said patiently. 'Start at the beginning and let me get this straight. '",0
5648,'It this here short white man with the m-m-mustache.'  'Mr. Blount. Yes.' 'Well--I didn't see how it commenced. I were standing in the back door when I heard this here commotion. Sound like a big fight in the alley. So I r-r-run to see. And this here white man had just gone hog wild. He were butting his head against the side of this brick wall and hitting with his fists. He were cussing and fighting like I never seen a white man fight before. With just this here wall. He liable to broken his own head the way he were carrying-on. Then two white mens who had heard the commotion come up and stand around and look----'  ',0
5649,So what happened?' 'Well--you know this here dumb gentleman--hands in pockets--this here----'  'Mr. Singer.' 'And he come along and just stood looking around to see what it were all about. And Mr. B-B-Blount seen him and commenced to talk and holler. And then all of a sudden he fallen down on the ground. Maybe he done really busted his head open. A p-p-p-police come up and somebody done told him Mr. Blount been staying here. ',0
5650,Biff bowed his head and organized the story he had just heard into a neat pattern. He rubbed his nose and thought for a minute. 'They liable to pile in here any minute.' Willie went to the door and looked down the street. 'Here they all come now. They having to drag him. ',0
5651,A dozen onlookers and a policeman all tried to crowd into the restaurant. Outside a couple of whores stood looking in through the front window. It was always funny how many people could crowd in from nowhere when anything out of the ordinary happened.,0
5652,"'No use creating any more disturbance than necessary,' Biff said. He looked at the policeman who supported the drunk. 'The rest of them might as well clear out. '",0
5653,"The policeman put the drunk in a chair and hustled the little crowd into the street again. Then he turned to Biff: 'Somebody said he was staying here with you.' 'No. But he might as well be,' Biff said.",0
5654,'Want me to take him with me?' Biff considered. 'He won't get into any more trouble tonight. Of course I can't be responsible--but I think this will calm him down. ',0
5655,"'O.K. I'll drop back in again before I knock off.'  Biff, Singer, and Jake Blount were left alone. For the first time since he had been brought in, Biff turned his attention to the drunk man. It seemed that Blount had hurt his jaw very badly. He was slumped down on the table with his big hand over his mouth, swaying backward and forward. There was a gash in his head and the blood ran from his temple. His knuckles were skinned raw, and he was so filthy that he looked as if he had been pulled by the scruff of the neck from a sewer. All the juice had spurted out of him and he was completely collapsed. The mute sat at the table across from him, taking it all in with his gray eyes.",0
5656,"Then Biff saw that Blount had not hurt his jaw, but he was holding his hand over his mouth because his lips were trembling. The tears began to roll down his grimy face. Now and then he glanced sideways at Biff and Singer, angry that they should see him cry. It was embarrassing. Biff shrugged his shoulders at the mute and raised his eyebrows with a what-to-do? expression. Singer cocked his head on one side.",0
5657,Biff was in a quandary. Musingly he wondered just how he should manage the situation. He was still trying to decide when the mute turned over the menu and began to write.,0
5658,If you cannot think of any place for him to go he can go home with me. First some soup and coffee would be good for him. With relief Biff nodded vigorously.,0
5659,"On the table he placed three special plates of the last evening meal, two bowls of soup, coffee, and dessert. But Blount would not eat. He would not take his hand away from his mouth, and it was as though his lips were some very secret part of himself which was being exposed. His breath came in ragged sobs and his big shoulders jerked nervously. Singer pointed to one dish after the other, but Blount just sat with his hand over his mouth and shook his head.",0
5660,"Biff enunciated slowly so that the mute could see. 'The jitters----' he said conversationally. The steam from the soup kept floating up into Blount's face, and after a little while he reached shakily for his spoon. He drank the soup and ate part of his dessert. His thick, heavy lips still trembled and he bowed his head far down over his plate.",0
5661,"Biff noted this. He was thinking that in nearly every person there was some special physical part kept always guarded. With the mute his hands. The kid Mick picked at the front of her blouse to keep the cloth from rubbing the new, tender nipples beginning to come out on her breast. With Alice it was her hair; she used never to let him sleep with her when he rubbed oil in his scalp. And with himself?  Lingeringly Biff turned the ring on his little finger.",0
5662,"Anyway he knew what it was not. Not. Any more. A sharp line cut into his forehead. His hand in his pocket moved nervously toward his genitals. He began whistling a song and got up from the table. Funny to spot it in other people, though.",0
5663,"They helped Blount to his feet. He teetered weakly. He was not crying any more, but he seemed to be brooding on something shameful and sullen. He walked in the direction he was led. Biff brought out the suitcase from behind the counter and explained to the mute about it. Singer looked as though he could not be surprised at anything.",0
5664,"Biff went with them to the entrance. 'Buck up and keep your nose clean,' he said to Blount. The black night sky was beginning to lighten and turn a deep blue with the new morning. There were but a few weak, silvery stars. The street was empty, silent, almost cool. Singer carried the suitcase with his left hand, and with his free hand he supported Blount. He nodded good-bye to Biff and they started off together down the sidewalk. Biff stood watching them. After they had gone half a block away only their black forms showed in the blue darkness--the mute straight and firm and the broad-shouldered, stumbling Blount holding on to him. When he could see them no longer, Biff waited for a moment and examined the sky. The vast depth of it fascinated and oppressed him. He rubbed his forehead and went back into the sharply lighted restaurant.",0
5665,"He stood behind the cash register, and his face contracted and hardened as he tried to recall the things that had happened during the night. He had the feeling that he wanted to explain something to himself. He recalled the incidents in tedious detail and was still puzzled.",0
5666,The door opened and closed several times as a sudden spurt of customers began to come in. The night was over. Willie stacked some of the chairs up on the tables and mopped at the floor. He was ready to go home and was singing. Willie was lazy. In the kitchen he was always stopping to play for a while on the harmonica he carried around with him. Now he mopped the floor with sleepy strokes and hummed his lonesome Negro music steadily.,0
5667,"The place was still not crowded--it was the hour when men who have been up all night meet those who are freshly wakened and ready to start a new day. The sleepy waitress was serving both beer and coffee. There was no noise or conversation, for each person seemed to be alone. The mutual distrust between the men who were just awakened and those who were ending a long night gave everyone a feeling of estrangement.",0
5668,"The bank building across the street was very pale in the dawn. Then gradually its white brick walls grew more distinct. When at last the first shafts of the rising sun began to brighten the street, Biff gave the place one last survey and went upstairs.",0
5669,Noisily he rattled the doorknob as he entered so that Alice would be disturbed. 'Motherogod!' he said. ' What a night!'  Alice awoke with caution.,0
5670,"She lay on the rumpled bed like a sulky cat and stretched herself. The room was drab in the fresh, hot morning sun, and a pair of silk stockings hung limp and withered from the cord of the window-shade. 'Is that drunk fool still hanging around downstairs?' she demanded.",0
5671,Biff took off his shirt and examined the collar to see if it were clean enough to be worn again. 'Go down and see for yourself. I told you nobody will hinder you from kicking him out. ',0
5672,"Sleepily Alice reached down and picked up a Bible, the blank side of a menu, and a Sunday School book from the floor beside the bed. She rustled through the tissue pages of the Bible until she reached a certain passage and began reading, pronouncing the words aloud with painful concentration. It was Sunday, and she was preparing the weekly lesson for her class of boys in the Junior Department of her church. ' Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. And Jesus said unto them, ""Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. '",0
5673,"Biff went into the bathroom to wash himself. The silky murmuring continued as Alice studied aloud. He listened. '...and in the morning, rising up a great while before day, He went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. And Simon and they that were with Him followed after Him. And when they had found Him, they said unto Him, ""All men seek for Thee.""'  She had finished.",0
5674,Biff let the words revolve again gently inside him. He tried to separate the actual words from the sound of Alice's voice as she had spoken them. He wanted to remember the passage as his mother used to read it when he was a boy. With nostalgia he glanced down at the wedding ring on his fifth finger that had once been hers. He wondered again how she would have felt about his giving up church and religion.,0
5675,"'The lesson for today is about the gathering of the disciples,' Alice said to herself in preparation. 'And the text is, ""All men seek for Thee.""'  Abruptly Biff roused himself from meditation and turned on the water spigot at full force. He stripped off his undervest and began to wash himself. Always he was scrupulously clean from the belt upward. Every morning he soaped his chest and arms and neck and feet--and about twice during the season he got into the bathtub and cleaned all of his parts.",0
5676,"Biff stood by the bed, waiting impatiently for Alice to get up. From the window he saw that the day would be windless and burning hot. Alice had finished reading the lesson. She still lay lazily across the bed, although she knew that he was waiting. A calm, sullen anger rose in him. He chuckled ironically. Then he said with bitterness: 'If you like I can sit and read the paper awhile. But I wish you would let me sleep now. '",0
5677,"Alice began dressing herself and Biff made up the bed. Deftly he reversed the sheets in all possible ways, putting the top one on the bottom, and turning them over and upside down. When the bed was smoothly made he waited until Alice had left the room before he slipped off his trousers and crawled inside. His feet jutted out from beneath the cover and his wiry-haired chest was very dark against the pillow. He was glad he had not told Alice about what had happened to the drunk. He had wanted to talk to somebody about it, because maybe if he told all the facts out loud he could put his finger on the thing that puzzled him. The poor son-of-a-bitch talking and talking and not ever getting anybody to understand what he meant. Not knowing himself, most likely. And the way he gravitated around the deaf-mute and picked him out and tried to make him a free present of everything in him.",0
5678,"Why?  Because in some men it is in them to give up everything personal at some time, before it ferments and poisons--throw it to some human being or some human idea. They have to. In some men it is in them---- The text is 'All men seek for Thee.' Maybe that was why--maybe---- He was a Chinaman, the fellow had said. And a nigger and a wop and a Jew. And if he believed it hard enough maybe it was so. Every person and every thing he said he was----  Biff stretched both of his arms outward and crossed his naked feet.",0
5679,"His face was older in the morning light, with the closed, shrunken eyelids and the heavy, iron-like beard on his cheeks and jaw. Gradually his mouth softened and relaxed. The hard, yellow rays of the sun came in through the window so that the room was hot and bright. Biff turned wearily and covered his eyes with his hands. And he was nobody but--Bartholomew--old Biff with two fists and a quick tongue--Mister Brannon--by himself.",0
5680,"[3] The sun woke Mick early, although she had stayed out mighty late the night before. It was too hot even to drink coffee for breakfast, so she had ice water with syrup in it and cold biscuits. She messed around the kitchen for a while and then went out on the front porch to read the funnies. She had thought maybe Mister Singer would be reading the paper on the porch like he did most Sunday mornings. But Mister Singer was not there, and later on her Dad said he came in very late the night before and had company in his room. She waited for Mister Singer a long time. All the other boarders came down except him. Finally she went back in the kitchen and took Ralph out of his high-chair and put a clean dress on him and wiped off his face. Then when Bubber got home from Sunday School she was ready to take the kids out. She let Bubber ride in the wagon with Ralph because he was barefooted and the hot sidewalk burned his feet. She pulled the wagon for about eight blocks until they came to the big, new house that was being built. The ladder was still propped against the edge of the roof, and she screwed up nerve and began to climb.",0
5681,"'You mind Ralph,' she called back to Bubber. 'Mind the gnats don't sit on his eyelids. '",0
5682,"Five minutes later Mick stood up and held herself very straight. She spread out her arms like wings. This was the place where everybody wanted to stand. The very top. But not many kids could do it. Most of them were scared, for if you lost grip and rolled off the edge it would kill you. All around were the roofs of other houses and the green tops of trees. On the other side of town were the church steeples and the smokestacks from the mills. The sky was bright blue and hot as fire. The sun made everything on the ground either dizzy white or black.",0
5683,"She wanted to sing. All the songs she knew pushed up toward her throat, but there was no sound. One big boy who had got to the highest part of the roof last week let out a yell and then started hollering out a speech he had learned at High School--'Friends, Romans, Countrymen, Lend me your ears!' There was something about getting to the very top that gave you a wild feeling and made you want to yell or sing or raise up your arms and fly.",0
5684,"She felt the soles of her tennis shoes slipping, and eased herself down so that she straddled the peak of the roof. The house was almost finished. It would be one of the largest buildings in the neighborhood--two stories, with very high ceilings and the steepest roof of any house she had ever seen. But soon the work would all be finished. The carpenters would leave and the kids would have to find another place to play.",0
5685,"She was by herself. No one was around and it was quiet and she could think for a while. She took from the pocket of her shorts the package of cigarettes she had bought the night before. She breathed in the smoke slowly. The cigarette gave her a drunk feeling so that her head seemed heavy and loose on her shoulders, but she had to finish it.",0
5686,"M.K.--That was what she would have written on everything when she was seventeen years old and very famous. She would ride back home in a red-and-white Packard automobile with her initials on the doors. She would have M.K. written in red on her handkerchiefs and underclothes. Maybe she would be a great inventor. She would invent little tiny radios the size of a green pea that people could carry around and stick in their ears. Also flying machines people could fasten on their backs like knapsacks and go zipping all over the world. After that she would be the first one to make a large tunnel through the world to China, and people could go down in big balloons. Those were the first things she would invent. They were already planned.",0
5687,"When Mick had finished half of the cigarette she smashed it dead and flipped the butt down the slant of the roof. Then she leaned forward so that her head rested on her arms and began to hum to herself. It was a funny thing--but nearly all the time there was some kind of piano piece or other music going on in the back of her mind. No matter what she was doing or thinking it was nearly always there. Miss Brown, who boarded with them, had a radio in her room, and all last winter she would sit on the steps every Sunday afternoon and listen in on the programs. Those were probably classical pieces, but they were the ones she remembered best. There was one special fellow's music that made her heart shrink up every time she heard it. Sometimes this fellow's music was like little colored pieces of crystal candy, and other times it was the softest, saddest thing she had ever imagined about.",0
5688,"There was the sudden sound of crying. Mick sat up straight and listened. The wind ruffled the fringe of hair on her forehead and the bright sun made her face white and damp. The whimpering continued, and Mick moved slowly along the sharp-pointed roof on her hands and knees. When she reached the end she leaned forward and lay on her stomach so that her head jutted over the edge and she could see the ground below.",0
5689,"The kids were where she had left them. Bubber was squatting over something on the ground and beside him was a little black, dwarf shadow. Ralph was still tied in the wagon. He was just old enough to sit up, and he held on to the sides of the wagon, with his cap crooked on his head, crying.",0
5690,'Bubber!' Mick called down. 'Find out what that Ralph wants and give it to him.',0
5691,Bubber stood up and looked hard into the baby's face. 'He don't want nothing. ',0
5692,"'Well, give him a good shake, then.' Mick climbed back to the place where she had been sitting before. She wanted to think for a long time about two or three certain people, to sing to herself, and to make plans. But that Ralph was still hollering and there wouldn't be any peace for her at all.",0
5693,"Boldly she began to climb down toward the ladder propped against the edge of the roof. The slant was very steep and there were only a few blocks of wood nailed down, very far apart from each other, that the workmen used for footholds. She was dizzy, and her heart beat so hard it made her tremble. Commandingly she talked out loud to herself: 'Hold on here with your hands tight and then slide down until your right toe gets a grip there and then stay close and wiggle over to the left. Nerve, Mick, you've got to keep nerve.'  Coming down was the hardest part of any climbing.",0
5694,"It took her a long time to reach the ladder and to feel safe again. When she stood on the ground at last she seemed much shorter and smaller and her legs felt for a minute like they would crumple up with her. She hitched her shorts and jerked the belt a notch tighter. Ralph was still crying, but she paid the sound no attention and went into the new, empty house.",0
5695,"Last month they had put a sign out in front saying that no children were allowed on the lot. A gang of kids had been scuffling around inside the rooms one night, and a girl who couldn't see in the dark had run into a room that hadn't been floored and fallen through and broken her leg. She was still at the hospital in a plaster parish cast. Also, another time some tough boys wee-weed all over one of the walls and wrote some pretty bad words. But no matter how many Keep Out signs were put up, they couldn't run kids away until the house had been painted and finished and people had moved in.",0
5696,"The rooms smelled of new wood, and when she walked the soles of her tennis shoes made a flopping sound that echoed through all the house. The air was hot and quiet. She stood still in the middle of the front room for a while, and then she suddenly thought of something. She fished in her pocket and brought out two stubs of chalk--one green and the other red.",0
5697,"Mick drew the big block letters very slowly. At the top she wrote EDISON, and under that she drew the names of DICK TRACY and MUSSOLINI. Then in each corner with the largest letters of all, made with green and outlined in red, she wrote her initials--M.K. When that was done she crossed over to the opposite wall and wrote a very bad word--PUSSY, and beneath that she put her initials, too.",0
5698,"She stood in the middle of the empty room and stared at what she had done. The chalk was still in her hands and she did not feel really satisfied. She was trying to think of the name of this fellow who had written this music she heard over the radio last winter. She had asked a girl at school who owned a piano and took music lessons about him, and the girl asked her teacher. It seemed this fellow was just a kid who had lived in some country in Europe a good while ago. But even if he was just a young kid he had made up all these beautiful pieces of the piano and for the violin and for a band or orchestra too. In her mind she could remember about six different tunes from the pieces of his she had heard. A few of them were kind of quick and tinkling, and another was like that smell in the springtime after a rain. But they all made her somehow sad and excited at the same time.",0
5699,"She hummed one of the tunes, and after a while in the hot, empty house by herself she felt the tears come in her eyes. Her throat got tight and rough and she couldn't sing any more. Quickly she wrote the fellow's name at the very top of the list--MOTSART.",0
5700,"Ralph was tied in the wagon just as she had left him. He sat up quiet and still and his fat little hands held on to the sides. Ralph looked like a little Chinese baby with his square black bangs and his black eyes. The sun was in his face, and that was why he had been hollering. Bubber was nowhere around. When Ralph saw her coming he began tuning up to cry again. She pulled the wagon into the shade by the side of the new house and took from her shirt pocket a blue-colored jelly bean. She stuck the candy in the baby's warm, soft mouth.",0
5701,"'Put that in your pipe and smoke it,' she said to him. In a way it was a waste, because Ralph was still too little to get the real good flavor out of candy. A clean rock would be about the same to him, only the little fool would swallow it. He didn't understand any more about taste than he did about talking. When you said you were so sick and tired of dragging him around you had a good mind to throw him in the river, it was the same to him as if you had been loving him. Nothing much made any difference to him. That was why it was such an awful bore to haul him around.",0
5702,"Mick cupped her hands, clamped them tight together, and blew through the crack between her thumbs. Her cheeks puffed out and at first there was only the sound of air rushing through her fists. Then a high, shrill whistle sounded, and after a few seconds Bubber came out from around the corner of the house.",0
5703,"She rumpled the sawdust out of Bubber's hair and straightened Ralph's cap. This cap was the finest thing Ralph had. It was made out of lace and all embroidered. The ribbon under his chin was blue on one side and white on the other, and over each ear there were big rosettes. His head had got too big for the cap and the embroidery scratched, but she always put it on him when she took him out. Ralph didn't have any real baby carriage like most folks' babies did, or any summer bootees. He had to be dragged around in a tacky old wagon she had got for Christmas three years before. But the fine cap gave him face.",0
5704,"There was nobody on the street, for it was late Sunday morning and very hot. The wagon screeched and rattled. Bubber was barefooted and the sidewalk was so hot it burned his feet. The green oak trees made cool-looking black shadows on the ground, but that was not shade enough.",0
5705,"'Get up in the wagon,' she told Bubber. ' And let Ralph sit in your lap.'",0
5706,"'I can walk all right. ' The long summer-time always gave Bubber the colic. He didn't have on a shirt and his ribs were sharp and white. The sun made him pale instead of brown, and his little titties were like blue raisins on his chest.",0
5707,"'I don't mind pulling you,' Mick said. 'Get on in.'  'O.K.'  Mick dragged the wagon slowly because she was not in any hurry to get home. She began talking to the kids. But it was really more like saying things to herself than words said to them.",0
5708,"'This is a funny thing--the dreams I've been having lately. It's like I'm swimming. But instead of water I'm pushing out my arms and swimming through great big crowds of people. The crowd is a hundred times bigger than in Kress's store on Saturday afternoon. The biggest crowd in the world. And sometimes I'm yelling and swimming through people, knocking them all down wherever I go--and other times I'm on the ground and people are trampling all over me and my insides are oozing out on the sidewalk. I guess it's more like a nightmare than a plain dream----'  On Sunday the house was always full of folks because the boarders had visitors.",0
5709,"Newspapers rustled and there was cigar smoke, and footsteps always on the stairs. 'Some things you just naturally want to keep private. Not because they are bad, but because you just want them secret. There are two or three things I wouldn't want even you to know about. '",0
5710,Bubber got out when they came to the corner and helped her lift the wagon down the curb and get it up on the next sidewalk. 'But there's one thing I would give anything for. And that's a piano. If we had a piano I'd practice every single night and learn every piece in the world. That's the thing I want more than anything else.',0
5711,"They had come to their own home block now. Their house was only a few doors away. It was one of the biggest houses on the whole north side of town--three stories high. But then there were fourteen people in the family. There weren't that many in the real, blood Kelly family--but they ate there and slept there at five dollars a head and you might as well count them on in. Mr. Singer wasn't counted in that because he only rented a room and kept it straightened up himself.",0
5712,The house was narrow and had not been painted for many years. It did not seem to be built strong enough for its three stories of height. It sagged on one side.,0
5713,"Mick untied Ralph and lifted him from the wagon. She darted quickly through the hall, and from the corner of her eye she saw that the living-room was full of boarders. Her Dad was in there, too. Her Mama would be in the kitchen. They were all hanging around waiting for dinner-time.",0
5714,"She went into the first of the three rooms that the family kept for themselves. She put Ralph down on the bed where her Dad and Mama slept and gave him a string of beads to play with. From behind the closed door of the next room she could hear the sound of voices, and she decided to go inside.",0
5715,"Hazel and Etta stopped talking when they saw her. Etta was sitting in the chair by the window, painting her toenails with the red polish. Her hair was done up in steel rollers and there was a white dab of face cream on a little place under her chin where a pimple had come out. Hazel was flopped out lazy on the bed as usual.",0
5716,"'What were you all jawing about?' 'It's none of your nosy business,' Etta said. 'Just you hush up and leave us alone. '",0
5717,'It's my room just as much as it is either one of yours. I have as good a right in here as you do.' Mick strutted from one corner to the other until she had covered all the floor space. ' But then I don't care anything about picking any fight. All I want are my own rights.',0
5718,Mick brushed back her shaggy bangs with the palm of her hand. She had done this so often that there was a little row of cowlicks above her forehead. She quivered her nose and made faces at herself in the mirror. Then she began walking around the room again.,0
5719,Hazel and Etta were O.K. as far as sisters went. But Etta was like she was full of worms. All she thought about was movie stars and getting in the movies. Once she had written to Jeanette MacDonald and had got a typewritten letter back saying that if ever she came out to Hollywood she could come by and swim in her swimming pool. And ever since that swimming pool had been preying on Etta's mind. All she thought about was going to Hollywood when she could scrape up the bus fare and getting a job as a secretary and being buddies with Jeanette MacDonald and getting in the movies herself.,0
5720,She primped all the day long. And that was the bad part. Etta wasn't naturally pretty like Hazel. The main thing was she didn't have any chin. She would pull at her jaw and go through a lot of chin exercises she had read in a movie book. She was always looking at her side profile in the mirror and trying to keep her mouth set in a certain way. But it didn't do any good. Sometimes Etta would hold her face with her hands and cry in the night about it.,0
5721,"Hazel was plain lazy. She was good-looking but thick in the head. She was eighteen years old, and next to Bill she was the oldest of all the kids in the family. Maybe that was the trouble. She got the first and biggest share of everything--the first whack at the new clothes and the biggest part of any special treat. Hazel never had to grab for anything and she was soft.",0
5722,"'Are you just going to tramp around the room all day? It makes me sick to see you in those silly boy's clothes. Somebody ought to clamp down on you, Mick Kelly, and make you behave,' Etta said.",0
5723,"'Shut up,' said Mick. 'I wear shorts because I don't want to wear your old hand-me-downs. I don't want to be like either of you and I don't want to look like either of you. And I won't. That's why I wear shorts. I'd rather be a boy any day, and I wish I could move in with Bill.'",0
5724,"Mick scrambled under the bed and brought out a large hatbox. As she carried it to the door both of them called after her, 'Good riddance!' Bill had the nicest room of anybody in the family. Like a den--and he had it all to himself--except for Bubber. Bill had pictures cut out from magazines tacked on the walls, mostly faces of beautiful ladies, and in another corner were some pictures Mick had painted last year herself at the free art class. There was only a bed and a desk in the room.",0
5725,"Bill was sitting hunched over the desk, reading Popular Mechanics. She went up behind him and put her arms around his shoulders. 'Hey, you old son-of-a-gun.'",0
5726,"He did not begin tussling with her like he used to do. 'Hey,' he said, and shook his shoulders a little. 'Will it bother you if I stay in here a little while?'  'Sure--I don't mind if you want to stay.'",0
5727,"Mick knelt on the floor and untied the string on the big hatbox. Her hands hovered over the edge of the lid, but for some reason she could not make up her mind to open it. 'I been thinking about what I've done on this already,' she said. ' And it may work and it may not. '",0
5728,"Bill went on reading. She still knelt over the box, but did not open it. Her eyes wandered over to Bill as he sat with his back to her. One of his big feet kept stepping on the other as he read. His shoes were scuffed. Once their Dad had said that all Bill's dinners went to his feet and his breakfast to one ear and his supper to the other ear. That was a sort of mean thing to say and Bill had been sour over it for a month, but it was funny. His ears flared out and were very red, and though he was just out of high school he wore a size thirteen shoe. He tried to hide his feet by scraping one foot behind the other when he stood up, but that only made it worse.",0
5729,"Mick opened the box a few inches and then shut it again. She felt too excited to look into it now. She got up and walked around the room until she could calm down a little. After a few minutes she stopped before the picture she had painted at the free government art class for school kids last winter. There was a picture of a storm on the ocean and a sea gull being dashed through the air by the wind. It was called 'Sea Gull with Back Broken in Storm.' The teacher had described the ocean during the first two or three lessons, and that was what nearly everybody started with. Most of the kids were like her, though, and they had never really seen the ocean with their own eyes.",0
5730,"That was the first picture she had done and Bill had tacked it on his wall. All the rest of her pictures were full of people. She had done some more ocean storms at first--one with an airplane crashing down and people jumping out to save themselves, and another with a trans-Atlantic liner going down and all the people trying to push and crowd into one little lifeboat.",0
5731,"Mick went into the closet of Bill's room and brought out some other pictures she had done in the class--some pencil drawings, some water-colors, and one canvas with oils. They were all full of people. She had imagined a big fire on Broad Street and painted how she thought it would be. The flames were bright green and orange and Mr. Brannon's restaurant and the First National Bank were about the only buildings left. People were lying dead in the streets and others were running for their lives. One man was in his nightshirt and a lady was trying to carry a bunch of bananas with her. Another picture was called 'Boiler Busts in Factory,' and men were jumping out of windows and running while a knot of kids in overalls stood scrouged together, holding the buckets of dinner they had brought to their Daddies. The oil painting was a picture of the whole town fighting on Broad Street. She never knew why she had painted this one and she couldn't think of the right name for it. There wasn't any fire or storm or reason you could see in the picture why all this battle was happening. But there were more people and more moving around than in any other picture. This was the best one, and it was too bad that she couldn't think up the real name. In the back of her mind somewhere she knew what it was.",0
5732,"Mick put the picture back on the closet shelf. None of them were any good much. The people didn't have any fingers and some of the arms were longer than the legs. The class had been fun, though. But she had just drawn whatever came into her head without reason--and in her heart it didn't give her near the same feeling that music did. Nothing was really as good as music.",0
5733,"Mick knelt down on the floor and quickly lifted the top of the big hatbox. Inside was a cracked ukulele strung with two violin strings, a guitar string and a banjo string. The crack on the back of the ukulele had been neatly mended with sticking plaster and the round hole in the middle was covered by a piece of wood. The bridge of a violin held up the strings at the end and some sound-holes had been carved on either side. Mick was making herself a violin. She held the violin in her lap. She had the feeling she had never really looked at it before. Some time ago she made Bubber a little play mandolin out of a cigar box with rubber bands, and that put the idea into her head. Since that she had hunted all over everywhere for the different parts and added a little to the job every day. It seemed to her she had done everything except use her head.",0
5734,"'Bill, this don't look like any real violin I ever saw.' He was still reading-- 'Yeah--?' 'It just don't look right. It just don't----'",0
5735,She had planned to tune the fiddle that day by screwing the pegs. But since she had suddenly realized how all the work had turned out she didn't want to look at it. Slowly she plucked one string after another. They all made the same little hollow-sounding ping.,0
5736,"'How anyway will I ever get a bow? Are you sure they have to be made out of just horses' hair?' 'Yeah,' said Bill impatiently.",0
5737,'Nothing like thin wire or human hair strung on a limber stick would do?' Bill rubbed his feet against each other and didn't answer. Anger made beads of sweat come out on her forehead. Her voice was hoarse. 'It's not even a bad violin. It's only a cross between a mandolin and a ukulele. And I hate them. I hate them----'  Bill turned around.,0
5738,"'It's all turned out wrong. It won't do. It's no good. '  'Pipe down,' said Bill.",0
5739,'Are you just carrying-on about that old broken ukulele you've been fooling with? I could have told you at first it was crazy to think you could make any violin. That's one thing you don't sit down and make--you got to buy them. I thought anybody would know a thing like that. But I figured it wouldn't hurt you if you found out for yourself. ',0
5740,"Sometimes she hated Bill more than anyone else in the world. He was different entirely from what he used to be. She started to slam the violin down on the floor and stomp on it, but instead she put it back roughly into the hatbox. The tears were hot in her eyes as fire. She gave the box a kick and ran from the room without looking at Bill.",0
5741,As she was dodging through the hall to get to the back yard she ran into her Mama. 'What's the matter with you. What have you been into now?',0
5742,"Mick tried to jerk loose, but her Mama held on to her arm. Sullenly she wiped the tears from her face with the back of her hand. Her Mama had been in the kitchen and she wore her apron and house-shoes. As usual she looked as though she had a lot on her mind and didn't have time to ask her any more questions.",0
5743,"'Mr. Jackson has brought his two sisters to dinner and there won't be but just enough chairs, so today you're to eat in the kitchen with Bubber.' 'That's hunky-dory with me,' Mick said. Her Mama let her go and went to take off her apron. From the dining-room there came the sound of the dinner bell and a sudden glad outbreak of talking. She could hear her Dad saying how much he had lost by not keeping up his accident insurance until the time he broke his hip. That was one thing her Dad could never get off his mind--ways he could have made money and didn't. There was a clatter of dishes, and after a while the talking stopped.",0
5744,"Mick leaned on the banisters of the stairs. The sudden crying had started her with the hiccups. It seemed to her as she thought back over the last month that she had never really believed in her mind that the violin would work. But in her heart she had kept making herself believe. And even now it was hard not to believe a little. She was tired out. Bill wasn't ever a help with anything now. She used to think Bill was the grandest person in the world. She used to follow after him every place he went--out fishing in the woods, to the clubhouses he built with other boys, to the slot machine in the back of Mr. Brannon's restaurant--everywhere. Maybe he hadn't meant to let her down like this. But anyway they could never be good buddies again.",0
5745,"In the hall there was the smell of cigarettes and Sunday dinner. Mick took a deep breath and walked back toward the kitchen. The dinner began to smell good and she was hungry. She could hear Portia's voice as she talked to Bubber, and it was like she was half-singing something or telling him a story.",0
5746,"'And that is the various reason why I'm a whole lot more fortunate than most colored girls,' Portia said as she opened the door. 'Why?' asked Mick. Portia and Bubber were sitting at the kitchen table eating their dinner. Portia's green print dress was cool-looking against her dark brown skin. She had on green earrings and her hair was combed very tight and neat.",0
5747,"'You all time pounce in on the very tail of what somebody say and then want to know all about it,' Portia said. She got up and stood over the hot stove, putting dinner on Mick's plate. 'Bubber and me was just talking about my Grandpapa's home out on the Old Sardis Road. I was telling Bubber how he and my uncles owns the whole place themself. Fifteen and a half acre. They always plants four of them in cotton, some years swapping back to peas to keep the dirt rich, and one acre on a hill is just for peaches. They haves a mule and a breed sow and all the time from twenty to twenty-five laying hens and fryers. They haves a vegetable patch and two pecan trees and plenty figs and plums and berries. This here is the truth. Not many white farms has done with their land good as my Grandpapa.'",0
5748,"Mick put her elbows on the table and leaned over her plate. Portia had always rather talk about the farm than anything else, except about her husband and brother. To hear her tell it you would think that colored farm was the very White House itself.",0
5749,"'The home started with just one little room. And through the years they done built on until there's space for my Grandpapa, his four sons and their wives and childrens, and my brother Hamilton. In the parlor they haves a real organ and a gramophone. And on the wall they haves a large picture of my Grandpapa taken in his lodge uniform. They cans all the fruit and vegetables and no matter how cold and rainy the winter turns they pretty near always haves plenty to eat.'",0
5750,"'How come you don't go live with them, then?' Mick asked. Portia stopped peeling her potatoes and her long, brown fingers tapped on the table in time to her words. ' This here the way it is. See--each person done built on his room for his fambly. They all done worked hard during all these years. And of course times is hard for everbody now. But see--I lived with my Grandpapa when I were a little girl. But I haven't never done any work out there since. Any time, though, if me and Willie and Highboy gets in bad trouble us can always go back. '  'Didn't your Father build on a room?'",0
5751,"Portia stopped chewing. 'Whose Father? You mean my Father?'  'Sure,' said Mick.",0
5752,'You know good and well my Father is a colored doctor right here in town. ',0
5753,"Mick had heard Portia say that before, but she had thought it was a tale. How could a colored man be a doctor? 'This here the way it is. Before the time my Mama married my Father she had never known anything but real kindness. My Grandpapa is Mister Kind hisself. But my Father is different from him as day is from night. '  'Mean?' asked Mick.  'No, he not a mean man,' Portia said slowly.",0
5754,'It just that something is the matter. My Father not like other colored mens. This here is hard to explain. My Father all the time studying by hisself. And a long time ago he taken up all these notions about how a fambly ought to be. He bossed over ever little thing in the house and at night he tried to teach us children lessons.',0
5755,"'That don't sound so bad to me,' said Mick. 'Listen here. You see most of the time he were very quiet. But then some nights he would break out in a kind of fit. He could get madder than any man I ever seen. Everbody who know my Father say that he was a sure enough crazy man. He done wild, crazy things and our Mama quit him. I were ten years old at the time. Our Mama taken us children with her to Grandpapa's farm and us were raised out there. Our Father all the time wanted us to come back. But even when our Mama died us children never did go home to live. And now my Father stay all by hisself.'",0
5756,"Mick went to the stove and filled her plate a second time. Portia's voice was going up and down like a song, and nothing could stop her now. 'I doesn't see my Father much--maybe once a week--but I done a lot of thinking about him. I feels sorrier for him than anybody I knows. I expect he done read more books than any white man in this town. He done read more books and he done worried about more things. He full of books and worrying. He done lost God and turned his back to religion. All his troubles come down just to that. '",0
5757,"Portia was excited. Whenever she got to talking about God--or Willie, her brother, or Highboy, her husband--she got excited. 'Now, I not a big shouter. I belongs to the Presbyterian Church and us don't hold with all this rolling on the floor and talking in tongues. Us don't get sanctified ever week and wallow around together. In our church we sings and lets the preacher do the preaching. And tell you the truth I don't think a little singing and a little preaching would hurt you, Mick. You ought to take your little brother to the Sunday School and also you plenty big enough to sit in church. From the biggity way you been acting lately it seem to me like you already got one toe in the pit.'",0
5758,"'Nuts,' Mick said. 'Now Highboy he were a Holiness boy before us were married. He loved to get the spirit ever Sunday and shout and sanctify hisself. But after us were married I got him to join with me, and although it kind of hard to keep him quiet sometime I think he doing right well. '",0
5759,"'I don't believe in God any more than I do Santa Claus,' Mick said. 'You wait a minute! That's why it sometime seem to me you favor my Father more than any person I ever knowed. '",0
5760,'Me? You say I favor him?' 'I don't mean in the face or in any kind of looks. I was speaking about the shape and color of your souls. ',0
5761,Bubber sat looking from one to the other. His napkin was tied around his neck and in his hand he still held his empty spoon. ' What all does God eat?' he asked.,0
5762,"Mick got up from the table and stood in the doorway, ready to leave. Sometimes it was fun to devil Portia. She started on the same tune and said the same thing over and over--like that was all she knew.",0
5763,"'Folks like you and my Father who don't attend the church can't never have nair peace at all. Now take me here--I believe and I haves peace. And Bubber, he haves his peace too. And my Highboy and my Willie likewise. And it seem to me just from looking at him this here Mr. Singer haves peace too. I done felt that the first time I seen him. '",0
5764,"'Have it your own way,' Mick said. 'You're crazier than any father of yours could ever be. '",0
5765,'But you haven't never loved God nor even nair person. You hard and tough as cowhide. But just the same I knows you. This afternoon you going to roam all over the place without never being satisfied. You going to traipse all around like you haves to find something lost. You going to work yourself up with excitement. Your heart going to beat hard enough to kill you because you don't love and don't have peace. And then some day you going to bust loose and be ruined. Won't nothing help you then.',0
5766,"'What, Portia?' Bubber asked. 'What kind of things does He eat?' Mick laughed and stamped out of the room.",0
5767,She did roam around the house during the afternoon because she could not get settled. Some days were just like that. For one thing the thought of the violin kept worrying her. She could never have made it like a real one--and after all those weeks of planning the very thought of it made her sick. But how could she have been so sure the idea would work? So dumb? Maybe when people longed for a thing that bad the longing made them trust in anything that might give it to them.,0
5768,"Mick did not want to go back into the rooms where the family stayed. And she did not want to have to talk to any of the boarders. No place was left but the street--and there the sun was too burning hot. She wandered aimlessly up and down the hall and kept pushing back her rumpled hair with the palm of her hand. 'Hell,' she said aloud to herself. 'Next to a real piano I sure would rather have some place to myself than anything I know. '",0
5769,"That Portia had a certain kind of niggery craziness, but she was O.K. She never would do anything mean to Bubber or Ralph on the sly like some colored girls. But Portia had said that she never loved anybody. Mick stopped walking and stood very still, rubbing her fist on the top of her head. What would Portia think if she really knew? Just what would she think?",0
5770,She had always kept things to herself. That was one sure truth. Mick went slowly up the stairs. She passed the first landing and went on to the second. Some of the doors were open to make a draught and there were many sounds in the house. Mick stopped on the last flight of stairs and sat down. If Miss Brown turned on her radio she could hear the music. Maybe some good program would come on.,0
5771,She put her head on her knees and tied knots in the strings of her tennis shoes. What would Portia say if she knew that always there had been one person after another? And every time it was like some part of her would bust in a hundred pieces.,0
5772,"But she had always kept it to herself and no person had ever known. Mick sat on the steps a long time. Miss Brown did not turn on her radio and there was nothing but the noises that people made. She thought a long time and kept hitting her thighs with her fists. Her face felt like it was scattered in pieces and she could not keep it straight. The feeling was a whole lot worse than being hungry for any dinner, yet it was like that. I want--I want--I want--was all that she could think about--but just what this real want was she did not know.",0
5773,"After about an hour there was the sound of a doorknob being turned on the landing above. Mick looked up quickly and it was Mister Singer. He stood in the hall for a few minutes and his face was sad and calm. Then he went across to the bathroom. His company did not come out with him. From where she was sitting she could see part of the room, and the company was asleep on the bed with a sheet pulled over him. She waited for Mister Singer to come out of the bathroom. Her cheeks were very hot and she felt them with her hands. Maybe it was true that she came up on these top steps sometimes so she could see Mister Singer while she was listening to Miss Brown's radio on the floor below. She wondered what kind of music he heard in his mind that his ears couldn't hear. Nobody knew. And what kind of things he would say if he could talk. Nobody knew that either.",0
5774,"Mick waited, and after a while he came out into the hall again. She hoped he would look down and smile at her. And then when he got to his door he did glance down and nod his head. Mick's grin was wide and trembling. He went into his room and shut the door. It might have been he meant to invite her in to see him. Mick wanted suddenly to go into his room. Sometime soon when he didn't have company she would really go in and see Mister Singer. She really would do that.",0
5775,"The hot afternoon passed slowly and Mick still sat on the steps by herself. This fellow Motsart's music was in her mind again. It was funny, but Mister Singer reminded her of this music. She wished there was some place where she could go to hum it out loud. Some kind of music was too private to sing in a house cram full of people. It was funny, too, how lonesome a person could be in a crowded house. Mick tried to think of some good private place where she could go and be by herself and study about this music. But though she thought about this a long time she knew in the beginning that there was no good place.",0
5776,"[4] Late in the afternoon Jake Blount awoke with the feeling that he had slept enough. The room in which he lay was small and neat, furnished with a bureau, a table, a bed, and a few chairs. On the bureau an electric fan turned its face slowly from one wall to another, and as the breeze from it passed Jake's face he thought of cool water. By the window a man sat before the table and stared down at a chess game laid out before him. In the daylight the room was not familiar to Jake, but he recognized the man's face instantly and it was as though he had known him a very long time.",0
5777,Many memories were confused in Jake's mind. He lay motionless with his eyes open and his hands turned palm upward. His hands were huge and very brown against the white sheet. When he held them up to his face he saw that they were scratched and bruised--and the veins were swollen as though he had been grasping hard at something for a long time. His face looked tired and unkempt. His brown hair fell down over his forehead and his mustache was awry. Even his wing-shaped eyebrows were rough and tousled. As he lay there his lips moved once or twice and his mustache jerked with a nervous quiver.,0
5778,"After a while he sat up and gave himself a thump on the side of his head with one of his big fists to straighten himself out. When he moved, the man playing chess looked up quickly and smiled at him. 'God, I'm thirsty,' Jake said. 'I feel like the whole Russian army marched through my mouth in its stocking feet. '",0
5779,"The man looked at him, still smiling, and then suddenly he reached down on the other side of the table and brought up a frosted pitcher of ice water and a glass. Jake drank in great panting gulps--standing half-naked in the middle of the room, his head thrown back and one of his hands closed in a tense fist. He finished four glasses before he took a deep breath and relaxed a little.",0
5780,"Instantly certain recollections came to him. He couldn't remember coming home with this man, but things that had happened later were clearer now. He had waked up soaking in a tub of cold water, and afterward they drank coffee and talked. He had got a lot of things off his chest and the man had listened. He had talked himself hoarse, but he could remember the expressions on the man's face better than anything that was said. They had gone to bed in the morning with the shade pulled down so no light could come in. At first he would keep waking up with nightmares and have to turn the light on to get himself clear again. The light would wake this fellow also, but he hadn't complained at all.",0
5781,"'How come you didn't kick me out last night? ' The man only smiled again. Jake wondered why he was so quiet. He looked around for his clothes and saw that his suitcase was on the floor by the bed. He couldn't remember how he had got it back from the restaurant where he owed for the drinks. His books, a white suit, and some shirts were all there as he had packed them. Quickly he began to dress himself.",0
5782,"An electric coffee-pot was perking on the table by the time he had his clothes on. The man reached into the pocket of the vest that hung over the back of a chair. He brought out a card and Jake took it questioningly. The man's name--John Singer--was engraved in the center, and beneath this, written in ink with the same elaborate precision as the engraving, there was a brief message.",0
5783,"I am a deaf-mute, but I read the lips and understand what is said to me. Please do not shout. The shock made Jake feel light and vacant. He and John Singer just looked at each other.",0
5784,"'I wonder how long it would have taken me to find that out,' he said. Singer looked very carefully at his lips when he spoke--he had noticed that before. But a dummy!",0
5785,"They sat at the table and drank hot coffee out of blue cups. The room was cool and the half-drawn shades softened the hard glare from the windows. Singer brought from his closet a tin box that contained a loaf of bread, some oranges, and cheese. He did not eat much, but sat leaning back in his chair with one hand in his pocket. Jake ate hungrily. He would have to leave the place immediately and think things over. As long as he was stranded he ought to scout around for some sort of job in a hurry. The quiet room was too peaceful and comfortable to worry in--he would get out and walk by himself for a while.",0
5786,'Are there any other deaf-mute people here?' he asked. 'You have many friends?',0
5787,"Singer was still smiling. He did not catch on to the words at first, and Jake had to repeat them. Singer raised his sharp, dark eyebrows and shook his head.",0
5788,"'Find it lonesome?' The man shook his head in a way that might have meant either yes or no. They sat silently for a little while and then Jake got up to leave. He thanked Singer several times for the night's lodging, moving his lips carefully so that he was sure to be understood. The mute only smiled again and shrugged his shoulders. When Jake asked if he could leave his suitcase under the bed for a few days the mute nodded that he could.",0
5789,Then Singer took his hands from his pocket and wrote carefully on a pad of paper with a silver pencil. He shoved the pad over toward Jake. I can put a mattress on the floor and you can stay here until you find a place. I am out most of the day. It will not be any trouble.,0
5790,"Jake felt his lips tremble with a sudden feeling of gratefulness. But he couldn't accept. 'Thanks,' he said. 'I already got a place.'",0
5791,"As he was leaving the mute handed him a pair of blue overalls, rolled into a tight bundle, and seventy-five cents. The overalls were filthy and as Jake recognized them they aroused in him a whirl of sudden memories from the past week. The money, Singer made him understand, had been in his pockets.",0
5792,"'Adios,' Jake said. 'I'll be back sometime soon. '",0
5793,He left the mute standing in the doorway with his hands still in his pockets and the half-smile on his face. When he had gone down several steps of the stairs he turned and waved. The mute waved back to him and closed his door.,0
5794,"Outside the glare was sudden and sharp against his eyes. He stood on the sidewalk before the house, too dazzled at first by the sunlight to see very clearly. A youngun was sitting on the banisters of the house. He had seen her somewhere before. He remembered the boy's shorts she was wearing and the way she squinted her eyes.",0
5795,He held up the dirty roll of overalls. 'I want to throw these away. Know where I can find a garbage can?',0
5796,The kid jumped down from the banisters. 'It's in the back yard. I'll show you.',0
5797,"He followed her through the narrow, dampish alley at the side of the house. When they came to the back yard Jake saw that two Negro men were sitting on the back steps. They were both dressed in white suits and white shoes. One of the Negroes was very tall and his tie and socks were brilliant green. The other was a light mulatto of average height. He rubbed a tin harmonica across his knee. In contrast with his tall companion his socks and tie were a hot red.",0
5798,The kid pointed to the garbage can by the back fence and then turned to the kitchen window. 'Portia!' she called. 'Highboy and Willie here waiting for you.',0
5799,A soft voice answered from the kitchen. 'You neen holler so loud. I know they is. I putting on my hat right now. ',0
5800,Jake unrolled the overalls before throwing them away. They were stiff with mud. One leg was torn and a few drops of blood stained the front. He dropped them in the can. A Negro girl came out of the house and joined the white-suited boys on the steps. Jake saw that the youngun in shorts was looking at him very closely. She changed her weight from one foot to the other and seemed excited.,0
5801,'Are you kin to Mister Singer?' she asked. 'Not a bit.'  'Good friend?'  'Good enough to spend the night with him.' 'I just wondered----'  'Which direction is Main Street?',0
5802,She pointed to the right. 'Two blocks down this way. ',0
5803,"Jake combed his mustache with his fingers and started off. He jingled the seventy-five cents in his hand and bit his lower lip until it was mottled and scarlet. The three Negroes were walking slowly ahead of him, talking among themselves. Because he felt lonely in the unfamiliar town he kept close behind them and listened. The girl held both of them by the arm. She wore a green dress with a red hat and shoes. The boys walked very close to her.",0
5804,"'What we got planned for this evening?' she asked. 'It depend entirely upon you, Honey,' the tall boy said. 'Willie and me don't have no special plans. '",0
5805,She looked from one to the other. 'You all got to decide.' 'Well----' said the shorter boy in the red socks. 'Highboy and me thought m-maybe us three go to church. ',0
5806,"The girl sang her answer in three different tones. ' O--K-- And after church I got a notion I ought to go and set with Father for a while--just a short while.' They turned at the first corner, and Jake stood watching them a moment before walking on.",0
5807,"The main street was quiet and hot, almost deserted. He had not realized until now that it was Sunday--and the thought of this depressed him. The awnings over the closed stores were raised and the buildings had a bare look in the bright sun. He passed the New York Café. The door was open, but the place looked empty and dark. He had not found any socks to wear that morning, and the hot pavement burned through the thin soles of his shoes. The sun felt like a hot piece of iron pressing down on his head. The town seemed more lonesome than any place he had ever known. The stillness of the street gave him a strange feeling. When he had been drunk the place had seemed violent and riotous. And now it was as though everything had come to a sudden, static halt.",0
5808,He went into a fruit and candy store to buy a paper. The Help-Wanted column was very short. There were several calls for young men between twenty-five and forty with automobiles to sell various products on commission. These he skipped over quickly. An advertisement for a truck-driver held his attention for a few minutes. But the notice at the bottom interested him most. It read:  Wanted--Experienced Mechanic.,0
5809,Sunny Dixie Show. Apply Corner Weavers Lane & 15th Street. Without knowing it he had walked back to the door of the restaurant where he had spent his time during the past two weeks. This was the only place on the block besides the fruit store which was not closed. Jake decided suddenly to drop in and see Biff Brannon.,0
5810,"The café was very dark after the brightness outside. Everything looked dingier and quieter than he had remembered it. Brannon stood behind the cash register as usual, his arms folded over his chest. His good-looking plump wife sat filing her fingernails at the other end of the counter. Jake noticed that they glanced at each other as he came in.",0
5811,"'Afternoon,' said Brannon. Jake felt something in the air. Maybe the fellow was laughing because he remembered things that had happened when he was drunk. Jake stood wooden and resentful. 'Package of Target, please.' As Brannon reached beneath the counter for the tobacco Jake decided that he was not laughing. In the daytime the fellow's face was not as hard-looking as it was at night. He was pale as though he had not slept, and his eyes had the look of a weary buzzard's.  'Speak up,' Jake said.",0
5812,"'How much do I owe you?' Brannon opened a drawer and put on the counter a public-school tablet. Slowly he turned over the pages and Jake watched him. The tablet looked more like a private notebook than the place where he kept his regular accounts. There were long lines of figures, added, divided, and subtracted, and little drawings. He stopped at a certain page and Jake saw his last name written at the corner. On the page there were no figures--only small checks and crosses. At random across the page were drawn little round, seated cats with long curved lines for tails. Jake stared. The faces of the little cats were human and female. The faces of the little cats were Mrs. Brannon.",0
5813,"'I have checks here for the beers,' Brannon said. ' And crosses for dinners and straight lines for the whiskey. Let me see----' Brannon rubbed his nose and his eyelids drooped down. Then he shut the tablet. 'Approximately twenty dollars. '",0
5814,"'It'll take me a long time,' Jake said. ' But maybe you'll get it. '",0
5815,"'There's no big hurry. ' Jake leaned against the counter. 'Say, what kind of a place is this town?'  'Ordinary,' Brannon said.",0
5816,'About like any other place the same size.'  'What population?'  'Around thirty thousand.' Jake opened the package of tobacco and rolled himself a cigarette. His hands were shaking. 'Mostly mills?'  'That's right.,0
5817,Four big cotton mills--those are the main ones. A hosiery factory. Some gins and sawmills.'  'What kind of wages?'  'I'd say around ten or eleven a week on the average--but then of course they get laid off now and then.,0
5818,What makes you ask all this? You mean to try to get a job in a mill?' Jake dug his fist into his eye and rubbed it sleepily. 'Don't know. I might and I might not.' He laid the newspaper on the counter and pointed out the advertisement he had just read. 'I think I'll go around and look into this. ',0
5819,"Brannon read and considered. ' Yeah,' he said finally. 'I've seen that show. It's not much--just a couple of contraptions such as a flying-jinny and swings. It corrals the colored people and mill hands and kids. They move around to different vacant lots in town. '  'Show me how to get there.",0
5820,' Brannon went with him to the door and pointed out the direction. 'Did you go on home with Singer this morning?',0
5821,"Jake nodded. 'What do you think of him?' Jake bit his lips. The mute's face was in his mind very clearly. It was like the face of a friend he had known for a long time. He had been thinking of the man ever since he had left his room. 'I didn't even know he was a dummy,' he said finally.",0
5822,"He began walking again down the hot, deserted street. He did not walk as a stranger in a strange town. He seemed to be looking for someone. Soon he entered one of the mill districts bordering the river. The streets became narrow and unpaved and they were not empty any longer. Groups of dingy, hungry-looking children called to each other and played games. The two-room shacks, each one like the other, were rotten and unpainted. The stink of food and sewage mingled with the dust in the air. The falls up the river made a faint rushing sound. People stood silently in doorways or lounged on steps. They looked at Jake with yellow, expressionless faces. He stared back at them with wide, brown eyes. He walked jerkily, and now and then he wiped his mouth with the hairy back of his hand.",0
5823,"At the end of Weavers Lane there was a vacant block. It had once been used as a junk yard for old automobiles. Rusted pieces of machinery and torn inner tubes still littered the ground. A trailer was parked in one corner of the lot, and near-by was a flying-jinny partly covered with canvas.",0
5824,"Jake approached slowly. Two little younguns in overalls stood before the flying-jinny. Near them, seated on a box, a Negro man drowsed in the late sunshine, his knees collapsed against each other. In one hand he held a sack of melted chocolate. Jake watched him stick his fingers in the miry candy and then lick them slowly.",0
5825,"'Who's the manager of this outfit?' The Negro thrust his two sweet fingers between his lips and rolled over them with his tongue. ' He a red-headed man,' he said when he had finished. 'That all I know, Cap'n.'  'Where's he now?'  'He over there behind that largest wagon.'  Jake slipped off his tie as he walked across the grass and stuffed it into his pocket.",0
5826,"The sun was beginning to set in the west. Above the black line of housetops the sky was warm crimson. The owner of the show stood smoking a cigarette by himself. His red hair sprang up like a sponge on the top of his head and he stared at Jake with gray, flabby eyes.",0
5827,'You the manager?'  'Uh-huh. Patterson's my name. ',0
5828,'I come about the job in this morning's paper.' 'Yeah. I don't want no greenhorn. I need a experienced mechanic.',0
5829,"'I got plenty of experience,' Jake said. 'What you ever done?'  'I've worked as a weaver and loom-fixer. I've worked in garages and an automobile assembly shop. All sorts of different things.'",0
5830,"Patterson guided him toward the partly covered flying-jinny. The motionless wooden horses were fantastic in the late afternoon sun. They pranced up statically, pierced by their dull gilt bars. The horse nearest Jake had a splintery wooden crack in its dingy rump and the eyes walled blind and frantic, shreds of paint peeled from the sockets. The motionless merry-go-round seemed to Jake like something in a liquor dream.",0
5831,"'I want a experienced mechanic to run this and keep the works in good shape,' Patterson said. 'I can do that all right.' 'It's a two-handed job,' Patterson explained. 'You're in charge of the whole attraction. Besides looking after the machinery you got to keep the crowd in order. You got to be sure that everybody gets on has a ticket. You got to be sure that the tickets are O.K. and not some old dance-hall ticket. Everybody wants to ride them horses, and you'd be surprised what niggers will try to put over on you when they don't have no money. You got to keep three eyes open all the time. '",0
5832,"Patterson led him to the machinery inside the circle of horses and pointed out the various parts. He adjusted a lever and the thin jangle of mechanical music began. The wooden cavalcade around them seemed to cut them off from the rest of the world. When the horses stopped, Jake asked a few questions and operated the mechanism himself.",0
5833,"'The fellow I had quit on me,' Patterson said when they had come out again into the lot. 'I always hate to break in a new man. '",0
5834,'When do I start?'  'Tomorrow afternoon. We run six days and nights a week--beginning at four and shutting up at twelve. You're to come about three and help get things going. And it takes about a hour after the show to fold up for the night. '  'What about pay?'  'Twelve dollars.',0
5835,"Jake nodded, and Patterson held out a dead-white, boneless hand with dirty fingernails. It was late when he left the vacant lot. The hard, blue sky had blanched and in the east there was a white moon. Dusk softened the outline of the houses along the street. Jake did not return immediately through Weavers Lane, but wandered in the neighborhoods near-by. Certain smells, certain voices heard from a distance, made him stop short now and then by the side of the dusty street. He walked erratically, jerking from one direction to another for no purpose. His head felt very light, as though it were made of thin glass. A chemical change was taking place in him. The beers and whiskey he had stored so continuously in his system set in a reaction. He was sideswiped by drunkenness. The streets which had seemed so dead before were quick with life. There was a ragged strip of grass bordering the street, and as Jake walked along the ground seemed to rise nearer to his face. He sat down on the border of grass and leaned against a telephone pole. He settled himself comfortably, crossing his legs Turkish fashion and smoothing down the ends of his mustache. Words came to him and dreamily he spoke them aloud to himself.",0
5836,'Resentment is the most precious flower of poverty. Yeah.' It was good to talk. The sound of his voice gave him pleasure. The tones seemed to echo and hang on the air so that each word sounded twice. He swallowed and moistened his mouth to speak again. He wanted suddenly to return to the mute's quiet room and tell him of the thoughts that were in his mind. It was a queer thing to want to talk with a deaf-mute. But he was lonesome.,0
5837,"The street before him dimmed with the coming evening. Occasionally men passed along the narrow street very close to him, talking in monotones to each other, a cloud of dust rising around their feet with each step. Or girls passed by together, or a mother with a child across her shoulder. Jake sat numbly for some time, and at last he got to his feet and walked on.",0
5838,"Weavers Lane was dark. Oil lamps made yellow, trembling patches of light in the doorways and windows. Some of the houses were entirely dark and the families sat on their front steps with only the reflections from a neighboring house to see by. A woman leaned out of a window and splashed a pail of dirty water into the street. A few drops of it splashed on Jake's face. High, angry voices could be heard from the backs of some of the houses. From others there was the peaceful sound of a chair slowly rocking.",0
5839,Jake stopped before a house where three men sat together on the front steps. A pale yellow light from inside the house shone on them. Two of the men wore overalls but no shirts and were barefooted. One of these was tall and loose-jointed. The other was small and he had a running sore on the corner of his mouth. The third man was dressed in shirt and trousers. He held a straw hat on his knee.,0
5840,"'Hey,' Jake said. The three men stared at him with mill-sallow, dead-pan faces. They murmured but did not change their positions. Jake pulled the package of Target from his pocket and passed it around. He sat down on the bottom step and took off his shoes. The cool, damp ground felt good to his feet.",0
5841,"'Working now?' 'Yeah,' said the man with the straw hat. ' Most of the time. '",0
5842,"Jake picked between his toes. 'I got the Gospel in me,' he said. 'I want to tell it to somebody.'",0
5843,The men smiled. From across the narrow street there was the sound of a woman singing. The smoke from their cigarettes hung close around them in the still air. A little youngun passing along the street stopped and opened his fly to make water.,0
5844,"'There's a tent around the corner and it's Sunday,' the small man said finally. 'You can go there and tell all the Gospel you want. '",0
5845,'It's not that kind. It's better. It's the truth. ',0
5846,"'What kind?'  Jake sucked his mustache and did not answer. After a while he said, 'You ever have any strikes here?'  'Once,' said the tall man. 'They had one of these here strikes around six years ago. '",0
5847,"'What happened?' The man with the sore on his mouth shuffled his feet and dropped the stub of his cigarette to the ground. ' Well--they just quit work because they wanted twenty cents a hour. There was about three hundred did it. They just hung around the streets all day. So the mill sent out trucks, and in a week the whole town was swarming with folks come here to get a job. '",0
5848,Jake turned so that he was facing them. The men sat two steps above him so that he had to raise his head to look into their eyes. 'Don't it make you mad?' he asked.,0
5849,"'How you mean--mad?' The vein in Jake's forehead was swollen and scarlet. 'Christamighty, man! I mean mad--m-a-d--mad.' He scowled up into their puzzled, sallow faces. Behind them, through the open front door he could see the inside of the house. In the front room there was three beds and a washstand. In the back room a barefooted woman sat sleeping in a chair. From one of the dark porches near-by there was the sound of a guitar.",0
5850,"'I was one of them come in on the trucks,' the tall man said. 'That makes no difference. What I'm trying to tell you is plain and simple. The bastards who own these mills are millionaires. While the doffers and carders and all the people behind the machines who spin and weave the cloth can't hardly make enough to keep their guts quiet. See? So when you walk around the streets and think about it and see hungry, worn-out people and ricket-legged younguns, don't it make you mad? Don't it?'",0
5851,Jake's face was flushed and dark and his lips trembled. The three men looked at him warily. Then the man in the straw hat began to laugh.,0
5852,'Go on and snicker. Sit there and bust your sides open. ',0
5853,The men laughed in the slow and easy way that three men laugh at one. Jake brushed the dirt from the soles of his feet and put on his shoes. His fists were closed tight and his mouth was contorted with an angry sneer. 'Laugh--that's all you're good for. I hope you sit there and snicker 'til you rot!' As he walked stiffly down the street the sound of their laughter and catcalls still followed him.,0
5854,"The main street was brightly lighted. Jake loitered on a corner, fondling the change in his pocket. His head throbbed, and although the night was hot a chill passed through his body. He thought of the mute and he wanted urgently to go back and sit with him awhile. In the fruit and candy store where he had bought the newspaper that afternoon he selected a basket of fruit wrapped in cellophane. The Greek behind the counter said the price was sixty cents, so that when he had paid he was left with only a nickel. As soon as he had come out of the store the present seemed a funny one to take a healthy man. A few grapes hung down below the cellophane, and he picked them off hungrily.",0
5855,"Singer was at home when he arrived. He sat by the window with the chess game laid out before him on the table. The room was just as Jake had left it, with the fan turned on and the pitcher of ice water beside the table. There was a panama hat on the bed and a paper parcel, so it seemed that the mute had just come in. He jerked his head toward the chair across from him at the table and pushed the chessboard to one side. He leaned back with his hands in his pockets, and his face seemed to question Jake about what had happened since he had left.",0
5856,"Jake put the fruit on the table. 'For this afternoon,' he said. ' The motto has been: Go out and find an octopus and put socks on it. '",0
5857,"The mute smiled, but Jake could not tell if he had caught what he had said. The mute looked at the fruit with surprise and then undid the cellophane wrappings. As he handled the fruits there was something very peculiar in the fellow's face. Jake tried to understand this look and was stumped. Then Singer smiled brightly.",0
5858,"'I got a job this afternoon with a sort of show. I'm to run the flying-jinny.' The mute seemed not at all surprised. He went into the closet and brought out a bottle of wine and two glasses. They drank in silence. Jake felt that he had never been in such a quiet room. The light above his head made a queer reflection of himself in the glowing wineglass he held before him--the same caricature of himself he had noticed many times before on the curved surfaces of pitchers or tin mugs--with his face egg-shaped and dumpy and his mustache straggling almost up to his ears. Across from him the mute held his glass in both hands. The wine began to hum through Jake's veins and he felt himself entering again the kaleidoscope of drunkenness. Excitement made his mustache tremble jerkily. He leaned forward with his elbows on his knees and fastened a wide, searching gaze on Singer.",0
5859,'I bet I'm the only man in this town that's been mad--I'm talking about really mean mad--for ten solid long years. I damn near got in a fight just a little while ago. Sometimes it seems to me like I might even be crazy. I just don't know. ',0
5860,"Singer pushed the wine toward his guest. Jake drank from the bottle and rubbed the top of his head. 'You see, it's like I'm two people. One of me is an educated man. I been in some of the biggest libraries in the country. I read. I read all the time. I read books that tell the pure honest truth. Over there in my suitcase I have books by Karl Marx and Thorstein Veblen and such writers as them. I read them over and over, and the more I study the madder I get. I know every word printed on every page. To begin with I like words. Dialectic materialism--Jesuitical prevarication'-- Jake rolled the syllables in his mouth with loving solemnity--'teleological propensity. '",0
5861,"The mute wiped his forehead with a neatly folded handkerchief. ' But what I'm getting at is this. When a person knows and can't make the others understand, what does he do?'",0
5862,"Singer reached for a wineglass, filled it to the brim, and put it firmly into Jake's bruised hand. 'Get drunk, huh?' Jake said with a jerk of his arm that spilled drops of wine on his white trousers. 'But listen! Wherever you look there's meanness and corruption. This room, this bottle of grape wine, these fruits in the basket, are all products of profit and loss. A fellow can't live without giving his passive acceptance to meanness. Somebody wears his tail to a frazzle for every mouthful we eat and every stitch we wear--and nobody seems to know. Everybody is blind, dumb, and blunt-headed--stupid and mean. '",0
5863,Jake pressed his fists to his temples. His thoughts had careened in several directions and he could not get control of them. He wanted to go berserk. He wanted to get out and fight violently with someone in a crowded street.,0
5864,"Still looking at him with patient interest, the mute took out his silver pencil. He wrote very carefully on a slip of paper, Are you Democrat or Republican? and passed the paper across the table. Jake crumpled it in his hand. The room had begun to turn around him again and he could not even read.",0
5865,"He kept his eyes on the mute's face to steady himself. Singer's eyes were the only things in the room that did not seem to move. They were varied in color, flecked with amber, gray, and a soft brown. He stared at them so long that he almost hypnotized himself. He lost the urge to be riotous and felt calm again. The eyes seemed to understand all that he had meant to say and to hold some message for him. After a while the room was steady again.",0
5866,"'You get it,' he said in a blurred voice. 'You know what I mean. '",0
5867,"From afar off there was the soft, silver ring of church bells. The moonlight was white on the roof next door and the sky was a gentle summer blue. It was agreed without words that Jake would stay with Singer a few days until he found a room. When the wine was finished the mute put a mattress on the floor beside the bed. Without removing any of his clothes Jake lay down and was instantly asleep.",0
5868,"[5] Far from the main street, in one of the Negro sections of the town, Doctor Benedict Mady Copeland sat in his dark kitchen alone. It was past nine o'clock and the Sunday bells were silent now. Although the night was very hot, there was a small fire in the round-bellied wood stove. Doctor Copeland sat close to it, leaning forward in a straight-backed kitchen chair with his head cupped in his long, slender hands. The red glow from the chinks of the stove shone on his face--in this light his heavy lips looked almost purple against his black skin, and his gray hair, tight against his skull like a cap of lamb's wool, took on a bluish color also. He sat motionless in this position for a long time. Even his eyes, which stared from behind the silver rims of his spectacles, did not change their fixed, somber gaze. Then he cleared his throat harshly and picked up a book from the floor beside his chair. All around him the room was very dark, and he had to hold the book close to the stove to make out the print. Tonight he read Spinoza. He did not wholly understand the intricate play of ideas and the complex phrases, but as he read he sensed a strong, true purpose behind the words and he felt that he almost understood.",0
5869,"Often at night the sharp jangle of the doorbell would rouse him from his silence, and in the front room he would find a patient with a broken bone or with a razor wound. But this evening he was not disturbed. And after the solitary hours spent sitting in the dark kitchen it happened that he began swaying slowly from side to side and from his throat there came a sound like a kind of singing moan. He was making this sound when Portia came.",0
5870,"Doctor Copeland knew of her arrival in advance. From the street outside he caught the sound of an harmonica playing a blues song and he knew that the music was played by William, his son. Without turning on the light he went through the hall and opened the front door. He did not step out on the porch, but stood in the dark behind the screen. The moonlight was bright and the shadows of Portia and William and Highboy lay black and solid on the dusty street. The houses in the neighborhood had a miserable look. Doctor Copeland's house was different from any other building near-by. It was built solidly of brick and stucco. Around the small front yard there was a picket fence. Portia said good-bye to her husband and brother at the gate and knocked on the screen door.",0
5871,'How come you sit here in the dark like this?' They went together through the dark hall back to the kitchen. 'You haves grand electric lights. It don't seem natural why you all the time sitting in the dark like this. '  Doctor Copeland twisted the bulb suspended over the table and the room was suddenly very bright.,0
5872,"'The dark suits me,' he said. The room was clean and bare. On one side of the kitchen table there were books and an inkstand--on the other side a fork, spoon, and plate. Doctor Copeland held himself bolt upright with his long legs crossed and at first Portia sat stiffly, too. The father and daughter had a strong resemblance to each other--both of them had the same broad, flat noses, the same mouths and foreheads. But Portia's skin was very light when compared to her Father's.",0
5873,"'It sure is roasting in here,' she said. 'Seem to me you would let this here fire die down except when you cooking.'  'If you prefer we can go up to my office,' Doctor Copeland said. 'I be all right, I guess. I don't prefer. '  Doctor Copeland adjusted his silver-rimmed glasses and then folded his hands in his lap.",0
5874,'How have you been since we were last together? You and your husband--and your brother?'  Portia relaxed and slipped her feet out of her pumps. 'Highboy and Willie and me gets along just fine. ',0
5875,"'William still boards with you?' 'Sure he do,' Portia said. 'You see--us haves our own way of living and our own plan. Highboy--he pay the rent. I buys all the food out of my money. And Willie--he tends to all of our church dues, insurance, lodge dues, and Saturday Night. Us three haves our own plan and each one of us does our parts.'",0
5876,"Doctor Copeland sat with his head bowed, pulling at his long fingers until he had cracked all of his joints. The clean cuffs of his sleeves hung down past his wrists--below them his thin hands seemed lighter in color than the rest of his body and the palms were soft yellow. His hands had always an immaculate, shrunken look, as though they had been scrubbed with a brush and soaked for a long time in a pan of water.",0
5877,"'Here, I almost forgot what I brought,' Portia said. ' Haves you had your supper yet?'  Doctor Copeland always spoke so carefully that each syllable seemed to be filtered through his sullen, heavy lips.",0
5878,"'No, I have not eaten. ' Portia opened a paper sack she had placed on the kitchen table. 'I done brought a nice mess of collard greens and I thought maybe we have supper together. I done brought a piece of side meat, too. These here greens needs to be seasoned with that. You don't care if the collards is just cooked in meat, do you?'",0
5879,"'It does not matter.' 'You still don't eat nair meat?'  'No. For purely private reasons I am a vegetarian, but it does not matter if you wish to cook the collards with a piece of meat.'",0
5880,"Without putting on her shoes Portia stood at the table and carefully began to pick over the greens. 'This here floor sure do feel good to my feets. You mind if I just walk around like this without putting back on them tight, hurting pumps?'  'No,' said Doctor Copeland.",0
5881,'That will be all right. ' 'Then--us'll have these nice collards and some hoecake and coffee. And I going to cut me off a few slices of this here white meat and fry it for myself.',0
5882,"Doctor Copeland followed Portia with his eyes. She moved slowly around the room in her stockinged feet, taking down the scrubbed pans from the wall, building up the fire, washing the grit from the collards. He opened his mouth to speak once and then composed his lips again.",0
5883,"'So you and your husband and your brother have your own co-operative plan,' he said finally. 'That's right. '",0
5884,"Doctor Copeland jerked at his fingers and tried to pop the joints again. 'Do you intend to plan for children?' Portia did not look at her father. Angrily she sloshed the water from the pan of collards. 'There be some things,' she said, 'that seem to me to depend entirely upon God.'",0
5885,"They did not say anything else. Portia left the supper to cook on the stove and sat silently with her long hands dropping down limp between her knees. Doctor Copeland's head rested on his chest as though he slept. But he was not sleeping; now and then a nervous tremor would pass over his face. Then he would breathe deeply and compose his face again. Smells of the supper began to fill the stifling room. In the quietness the clock on top of the cupboard sounded very loud, and because of what they had just said to each other the monotonous ticking was like the word 'chil-dren, chil-dren,' said over and over.",0
5886,"He was always meeting one of them--crawling naked on a floor or engaged in a game of marbles or even on a dark street with his arms around a girl. Benedict Copeland, the boys were all called. But for the girls there were such names as Benny Mae or Madyben or Benedine Madine. He had counted one day, and there were more than a dozen named for him.",0
5887,"But all his life he had told and explained and exhorted. You cannot do this, he would say. There are all reasons why this sixth or fifth or ninth child cannot be, he would tell them. It is not more children we need but more chances for the ones already on the earth. Eugenic Parenthood for the Negro Race was what he would exhort them to. He would tell them in simple words, always the same way, and with the years it came to be a sort of angry poem which he had always known by heart.",0
5888,He studied and knew the development of any new theory. And from his own pocket he would distribute the devices to his patients himself. He was by far the first doctor in the town to even think of such. And he would give and explain and give and tell them. And then deliver maybe two score times a week. Madyben and Benny Mae.,0
5889,That was only one point. Only one. All of his life he knew that there was a reason for his working. He always knew that he was meant to teach his people. All day he would go with his bag from house to house and on all things he would talk to them.,0
5890,"After the long day a heavy tiredness would come in him. But in the evening when he opened the front gate the tiredness would go away. There were Hamilton and Karl Marx and Portia and little William. There was Daisy, too.",0
5891,Portia took the lid from the pan on the stove and stirred the collards with a fork. 'Father----' she said after a while.  Doctor Copeland cleared his throat and spat into a handkerchief. His voice was bitter and rough. ' Yes?'  'Less us quit this here quarreling with each other.,0
5892,"' 'We were not quarreling,' said Doctor Copeland. 'It don't take words to make a quarrel,' Portia said. 'It look to me like us is always arguing even when we sitting perfectly quiet like this. It just this here feeling I haves. I tell you the truth--ever time I come to see you it mighty near wears me out. So less us try not to quarrel in any way no more. '",0
5893,"'It is certainly not my wish to quarrel. I am sorry if you have that feeling, Daughter.' She poured out coffee and handed one cup unsweetened to her father. In her own portion she put several spoons of sugar. 'I getting hungry and this will taste good to us. Drink your coffee while I tell you something which happened to us a piece back. Now that it all over it seem a little bit funny, but we got plenty reason not to laugh too hard. '  'Go ahead,' said Doctor Copeland.",0
5894,"'Well--sometime back a real fine-looking, dressed-up colored man come in town here. He called hisself Mr. B. F. Mason and said he come from Washington, D.C. Ever day he would walk up and down the street with a walking-cane and a pretty colored shirt on. Then at night he would go to the Society Café. He eaten finer than any man in this town. Ever night he would order hisself a bottle of gin and two pork chops for his supper. He always had a smile for everbody and was always bowing around to the girls and holding a door open for you to come in or go out. For about a week he made hisself mighty pleasant wherever he were. Peoples begun to ask questions and wonder about this rich Mr. B. F. Mason. Then pretty soon, after he acquaints hisself, he begun to settle down to business. '",0
5895,"Portia spread out her lips and blew into her saucer of coffee. 'I suppose you done read in the paper about this Goverment Pincher business for old folks?'  Doctor Copeland nodded. 'Pension,' he said.",0
5896,"'Well--he were connected with that. He were from the goverment. He had come down from the President in Washington, D.C., to join everbody up for the Goverment Pinchers. He went around from one door to the next explaining how you pay one dollar down to join and after that twenty-five cents a week--and how when you were forty-five year old the goverment would pay you fifty dollars ever month of your life. All the peoples I know were very excited about this. He give everbody that joined a free picture of the President with his name signed under it. He told how at the end of six months there were going to be free uniforms for ever member. The club was called the Grand League of Pincheners for Colored Peoples--and at the end of two months everbody was going to get a orange ribbon with a G.L.P.C.P. on it to stand for the name. You know, like all these other letter things in the goverment. He come around from house to house with this little book and everbody commenced to join. He wrote their names down and took the money. Ever Saturday he would collect. In three weeks this Mr. B. F. Mason had joined up so many peoples he couldn't get all the way around on Saturday. He have to pay somebody to take up the collections in each three four blocks. I collected early ever Saturday for near where we live and got that quarter. Course Willie had joined at the beginning for him and Highboy and me.'",0
5897,"'I have come across many pictures of the President in various houses near where you live and I remember hearing the name Mason mentioned,' said Doctor Copeland. 'He was a thief?' 'He were,' said Portia. 'Somebody begun to find out about this Mr. B. F. Mason and he were arrested. They find out he were from just plain Atlanta and hadn't never smelled no Washington, D.C., or no President. All the money were hid or spent. Willie had just throwed away seven dollars and fifty cents. '",0
5898,"Doctor Copeland was excited. 'That is what I mean by----'  'In the hereafter,' Portia said, 'that man sure going to wake up with a hot pitchfork in his gut. But now that it all over it do seem a little bit funny, but of course we got plenty reason not to laugh too hard. '",0
5899,"'The Negro race of its own accord climbs up on the cross on every Friday,' said Doctor Copeland. Portia's hands shook and coffee trickled down from the saucer she was holding. She licked it from her arm. 'What you mean?'  'I mean that I am always looking.",0
5900,"I mean that if I could just find ten Negroes--ten of my own people--with spine and brains and courage who are willing to give all that they have----'  Portia put down the coffee. 'Us was not talking about anything like that.' 'Only four Negroes,' said Doctor Copeland. 'Only the sum of Hamilton and Karl Marx and William and you. Only four Negroes with these real true qualities and backbone----'  'Willie and Highboy and me have backbone,' said Portia angrily.",0
5901,' This here is a hard world and it seem to me us three struggles along pretty well.' For a minute they were silent. Doctor Copeland laid his spectacles on the table and pressed his shrunken fingers to his eyeballs.,0
5902,"'You all the time using that word--Negro,' said Portia. ' And that word haves a way of hurting peoples' feelings. Even old plain nigger is better than that word. But polite peoples--no matter what shade they is--always says colored.'",0
5903,Doctor Copeland did not answer. 'Take Willie and me. Us aren't all the way colored. Our Mama was real light and both of us haves a good deal of white folks' blood in us. And Highboy--he Indian. He got a good part of Indian in him. None of us is pure colored and the word you all the time using haves a way of hurting peoples' feelings.',0
5904,"'I am not interested in subterfuges,' said Doctor Copeland. 'I am interested only in real truths. '",0
5905,"'Well, this here is a truth. Everbody is scared of you. It sure would take a whole lot of gin to get Hamilton or Buddy or Willie or my Highboy to come in this house and sit with you like I does. Willie say he remember you when he were only a little boy and he were afraid of his own father then. '",0
5906,Doctor Copeland coughed harshly and cleared his throat. 'Everbody haves feelings--no matter who they is--and nobody is going to walk in no house where they certain their feelings will be hurt. You the same way. I seen your feelings injured too many times by white peoples not to know that. ',0
5907,"'No,' said Doctor Copeland. 'You have not seen my feelings injured. '",0
5908,'Course I realize that Willie or my Highboy or me--that none of us is scholars. But Highboy and Willie is both good as gold. There just is a difference between them and you.',0
5909,"'Yes,' said Doctor Copeland. 'Hamilton or Buddy or Willie or me--none of us ever cares to talk like you. Us talk like our own Mama and her peoples and their peoples before them. You think out everthing in your brain. While us rather talk from something in our hearts that has been there for a long time. That's one of them differences. '",0
5910,"'Yes,' said Doctor Copeland. 'A person can't pick up they children and just squeeze them to which-a-way they wants them to be. Whether it hurt them or not. Whether it right or wrong. You done tried that hard as any man could try. And now I the only one of us that would come in this here house and sit with you like this. '",0
5911,"The light was very bright in Doctor Copeland's eyes and her voice was loud and hard. He coughed and his whole face trembled. He tried to pick up the cup of cold coffee, but his hand would not hold it steadily. The tears came up to his eyes and he reached for his glasses to try to hide them.",0
5912,"Portia saw and went up to him quickly. She put her arms around his head and pressed her cheek to his forehead. 'I done hurt my Father's feelings,' she said softly.",0
5913,His voice was hard. ' No. It is foolish and primitive to keep repeating this about hurt feelings.',0
5914,"The tears went slowly down his cheek and the fire made them take on the colors of blue and green and red. 'I be really and truly sorry,' said Portia.  Doctor Copeland wiped his face with his cotton handkerchief. 'It is all right. '",0
5915,'Less us not ever quarrel no more. I can't stand this here fighting between us. It seem to me that something real bad come up in us ever time we be together. Less us never quarrel like this no more.',0
5916,"'No,' said Doctor Copeland. 'Let us not quarrel.' Portia sniffled and wiped her nose with the back of her hand. For a few minutes she stood with her arms around her father's head. Then after a while she wiped her face for a final time and went over to the pot of greens on the stove.",0
5917,"'It mighty nigh time for these to be tender,' she said cheerfully. ' Now I think I'll start making some of them good little hoecakes to go along with them.'",0
5918,"Portia moved slowly around the kitchen in her stockinged feet and her father followed her with his eyes. For a while again they were silent. With his eyes wet, so that the edges of things were blurred, Portia was truly like her mother. Years ago Daisy had walked like that around the kitchen, silent and occupied. Daisy was not black as he was--her skin had been like the beautiful color of dark honey. She was always very quiet and gentle. But beneath that soft gentleness there was something stubborn in her, and no matter how conscientiously he studied it all out, he could not understand the gentle stubbornness in his wife.",0
5919,He would exhort her and he would tell her all that was in his heart and still she was gentle. And still she would not listen to him but would go on her own way. Then later there were Hamilton and Karl Marx and William and Portia. And this feeling of real true purpose for them was so strong that he knew exactly how each thing should be with them. Hamilton would be a great scientist and Karl Marx a teacher of the Negro race and William a lawyer to fight against injustice and Portia a doctor for women and children.,0
5920,"And when they were even babies he would tell them of the yoke they must thrust from their shoulders--the yoke of submission and slothfulness. And when they were a little older he would impress upon them that there was no God, but that their lives were holy and for each one of them there was this real true purpose. He would tell it to them over and over, and they would sit together far away from him and look with their big Negro-children eyes at their mother. And Daisy would sit without listening, gentle and stubborn.",0
5921,"Because of the true purpose for Hamilton, Karl Marx, William, and Portia, he knew how every detail should be. In the autumn of each year he took them all into town and bought for them good black shoes and black stockings. For Portia he bought black woolen material for dresses and white linen for collars and cuffs. For the boys there was black wool for trousers and fine white linen for shirts. He did not want them to wear bright-colored, flimsy clothes. But when they went to school those were the ones they wished to wear, and Daisy said that they were embarrassed and that he was a hard father. He knew how the house should be. There could be no fanciness--no gaudy calendars or lace pillows or knickknacks--but everything in the house must be plain and dark and indicative of work and the real true purpose.",0
5922,"Then one night he found that Daisy had pierced holes in little Portia's ears for earrings. And another time a kewpie doll with feather skirts was on the mantelpiece when he came home, and Daisy was gentle and hard and would not put it away. He knew, too, that Daisy was teaching the children the cult of meekness. She told them about hell and heaven. Also she convinced them of ghosts and of haunted places. Daisy went to church every Sunday and she talked sorrowfully to the preacher of her own husband. And with her stubbornness she always took the children to the church, too, and they listened.",0
5923,"The whole Negro race was sick, and he was busy all the day and sometimes half the night. After the long day a great weariness would come in him, but when he opened the front gate of his home the weariness would go away. Yet when he went into the house William would be playing music on a comb wrapped in toilet paper, Hamilton and Karl Marx would be shooting craps for their lunch money, Portia would be laughing with her mother.",0
5924,"He would start all over with them, but in a different way. He would bring out their lessons and talk with them. They would sit close together and look at their mother. He would talk and talk, but none of them wanted to understand.",0
5925,"The feeling that would come on him was a black, terrible, Negro feeling. He would try to sit in his office and read and meditate until he could be calm and start again. He would pull down the shades of the room so that there would be only the bright light and the books and the feeling of meditation. But sometimes this calmness would not come. He was young, and the terrible feeling would not go away with study.",0
5926,"Hamilton, Karl Marx, William, and Portia would be afraid of him and look at their mother--and sometimes when he realized this the black feeling would conquer him and he knew not what he did. He could not stop those terrible things, and afterward he could never understand. 'This here supper sure smells good to me,' said Portia. 'I expect us better eat now because Highboy and Willie liable to come trooping in any minute. '  Doctor Copeland settled his spectacles and pulled his chair up to the table.",0
5927,"'Where have your husband and William been spending the evening?'  'They been throwing horseshoes. This here Raymond Jones haves a horseshoe place in his back yard. This Raymond and his sister, Love Jones, plays ever night. Love is such a ugly girl I don't mind about Highboy or Willie going around to their house any time they wishes. But they said they would come back for me at quarter to ten and I expecting them now any minute.'",0
5928,"'Before I forget,' said Doctor Copeland. 'I suppose you hear frequently from Hamilton and Karl Marx.'  'I does from Hamilton. He practically taken over all the work on our Grandpapa's place. But Buddy, he in Mobile--and you know he were never a big hand at writing letters. However, Buddy always haves such a sweet way with peoples that I don't ever worry concerning him. He the kind to always get along right well. '",0
5929,"They sat silently at the table before the supper. Portia kept looking up at the clock on the cupboard because it was time for Highboy and Willie to come. Doctor Copeland bent his head over his plate. He held the fork in his hand as though it were heavy, and his fingers trembled. He only tasted the food and with each mouthful he swallowed hard. There was a feeling of strain, and it seemed as though both of them wanted to keep up some conversation.",0
5930,Doctor Copeland did not know how to begin. Sometimes he thought that he had talked so much in the years before to his children and they had understood so little that now there was nothing at all to say. After a while he wiped his mouth with his handkerchief and spoke in an uncertain voice.,0
5931,"'You have hardly mentioned yourself. Tell me about your job and what you have been doing lately.' 'Course I still with the Kellys,' said Portia. ' But I tells you, Father, I don't know how long I going to be able to keep on with them. The work is hard and it always take me a long time to get through. However, that don't bother me none. It about the pay I worries about. I suppose to get three dollars a week--but sometimes Mrs. Kelly lacks a dollar or fifty cents of paying me the full amount. Course she always catches up on it soon as she able. But it haves a way of leaving me in a pinch.'",0
5932,"'That is not right,' said Doctor Copeland. 'Why do you stand for it?' 'It ain't her fault. She can't help it,' said Portia. ' Half the folks in that house don't pay the rent, and it a big expense to keep everthing up. I tell you the truth--the Kellys is just barely keeping one jump ahead of the sheriff. They having a mighty hard time. '",0
5933,"'There ought to be some other job you can get.' 'I know. But the Kellys is really grand white peoples to work for. I really fond of them as I can be. Them three little children is just like some of my own kinfolks. I feel like I done really raised Bubber and the baby. And although Mick and me is always getting into some kind of quarrel together, I haves a real close fondness for her, too.'",0
5934,"'But you must think of yourself,' said Doctor Copeland. 'Mick, now----' said Portia. ' She a real case. Not a soul know how to manage that child. She just as biggity and headstrong as she can be. Something going on in her all the time. I haves a funny feeling about that child. It seem to me that one of these days she going to really surprise somebody. But whether that going to be a good surprise or a bad surprise I just don't know. Mick puzzle me sometimes. But still I really fond of her.'",0
5935,"'You must look out for your own livelihood first. ' 'As I say, it ain't Mrs. Kelly's fault. It cost so much to run that big old house and the rent just don't be paid. Ain't but one person in the house who pay a decent amount for his room and put it on the dot without fail. And that man only been living there a short while. He one of these here deaf-and-dumb folks. He the first one of them I ever seen close up--but he a mighty fine white man. '",0
5936,"'Tall, thin, with gray and green eyes?' asked Doctor Copeland suddenly. ' And always polite to everyone and very well dressed? Not like someone from this town--more like a Northerner or maybe a Jew?'  'That him,' said Portia.",0
5937,"Eagerness came into Doctor Copeland's face. He crumbled his hoecake into the collard juice in his plate and began to eat with a new appetite. 'I have a deaf-mute patient,' he said.",0
5938,"'How come you acquainted with Mr. Singer?' asked Portia.  Doctor Copeland coughed and covered his mouth with his handkerchief. 'I have just seen him several times.' 'I better clean up now,' said Portia. ' It sure enough time for Willie and my Highboy. But with this here real sink and grand running water these little dishes won't take me two winks.'",0
5939,"The quiet insolence of the white race was one thing he had tried to keep out of his mind for years. When the resentment would come to him he would cogitate and study. In the streets and around white people he would keep the dignity on his face and always be silent. When he was younger it was 'Boy'--but now it was 'Uncle.' 'Uncle, run down to that filling-station on the corner and send me a mechanic.' A white man in a car had called out those words to him not long ago. 'Boy, give me a hand with this.' --'Uncle, do that.' And he would not listen, but would walk on with the dignity in him and be silent.",0
5940,A few nights ago a drunken white man had come up to him and begun pulling him along the street. He had his bag with him and he was sure someone was hurt. But the drunkard had pulled him into a white man's restaurant and the white men at the counter had begun hollering out with their insolence. He knew that the drunkard was making fun of him. Even then he had kept the dignity in him.,0
5941,"But with this tall, thin white man with the gray-green eyes something had happened that had never happened to him with any white man before. It came about on a dark, rainy night several weeks ago. He had just come from a maternity case and was standing in the rain on a corner. He had tried to light a cigarette and one by one the matches in his box fizzled out. He had been standing with the unlighted cigarette in his mouth when the white man stepped up and held for him a lighted match. In the dark with the flame between them they could see each other's faces. The white man smiled at him and lighted for him his cigarette. He did not know what to say, for nothing like that had ever happened to him before.",0
5942,"They had stood for a few minutes on the street corner together, and then the white man had handed him his card. He wanted to talk to the white man and ask him some questions, but he did not know for sure if he could really understand. Because of the insolence of all the white race he was afraid to lose his dignity in friendliness.",0
5943,"But the white man had lighted his cigarette and smiled and seemed to want to be with him. Since then he had thought this over many times. 'I have a deaf-mute patient,' said Doctor Copeland to Portia. 'The patient is a boy five years of age. And somehow I cannot get over the feeling that I am to blame for his handicap. I delivered him, and after two post-delivery visits of course I forgot about him. He developed ear trouble, but the mother paid no attention to the discharges from his ears and did not bring him to me. When it was finally brought to my attention it was too late. Of course he hears nothing and of course he therefore cannot speak. But I have watched him carefully, and it seems to me that if he were normal he would be a very intelligent child.'",0
5944,"'You always had a great interest in little children,' said Portia. 'You care a heap more about them than about grown peoples, don't you?' 'There is more hope in the young child,' said Doctor Copeland. ' But this deaf boy--I have been meaning to make inquiries and find if there is some institution that would take him. '",0
5945,'Mr. Singer would tell you. He a truly kind white man and he not a bit biggity. ',0
5946,'I do not know----' said Doctor Copeland. 'I have thought once or twice about writing him a note and seeing if he could give me information. ',0
5947,"'Sure I would if I was you. You a grand letter-writer and I would give it to Mr. Singer for you,' said Portia. ' He come down in the kitchen two-three weeks ago with a few shirts he wanted me to rinch out for him. Them shirts were no more dirty than if Saint John the Baptist hisself had been wearing them. All I had to do were dip them in warm water and give the collars a small rub and press them. But that night when I taken them five clean shirts up to his room you know how much he give me?'  'No.'",0
5948,"'He smile like he always do and hand over to me a dollar. A whole dollar just for them little shirts. He one really kind and pleasant white man and I wouldn't be afraid to ask him any question. I wouldn't even mind writing that nice white man a letter myself. You go right ahead and do it, Father, if you wants to.'",0
5949,"'Perhaps I will,' said Doctor Copeland. Portia sat up suddenly and began arranging her tight, oily hair. There was the faint sound of a harmonica and then gradually the music grew louder. 'Here come Willie and Highboy,' Portia said. 'I got to go out now and meet them. You take care of yourself now, and send me a word if you needs me for anything. I did enjoy the supper with you and the talking very much. '",0
5950,"The music from the harmonica was very clear now, and they could tell that Willie was playing while he waited at the front gate. 'Wait a minute,' said Doctor Copeland. 'I have only seen your husband with you about two times and I believe we have never really met each other. And it has been three years since William has visited his father. Why not tell them to drop in for a little while?'",0
5951,"Portia stood in the doorway, fingering her hair and her earrings. 'Last time Willie come in here you hurted his feelings. You see you don't understand just how----'  'Very well,' said Doctor Copeland.",0
5952,"'It was only a suggestion.' 'Wait,' said Portia. 'I going to call them. I going to invite them in right now. '  Doctor Copeland lighted a cigarette and walked up and down the room.",0
5953,"He could not straighten his glasses to just the right position and his fingers kept trembling. From the front yard there was the sound of low voices. Then heavy footsteps were in the hall and Portia, William, and Highboy entered the kitchen.",0
5954,"'Here we is,' said Portia. ' Highboy, I don't believe you and my Father has ever truly been introduced to each other. But you knows who each other is.'",0
5955,"Doctor Copeland shook hands with both of them. Willie hung back shyly against the wall, but Highboy stepped forward and bowed formally. 'I has always heard so much about you,' he said. 'I be very pleased to make your acquaintance. '",0
5956,"Portia and Doctor Copeland brought in chairs from the hall and the four of them sat around the stove. They were silent and uneasy. Willie gazed nervously around the room--at the books on the kitchen table, the sink, the cot against the wall, and at his father. Highboy grinned and picked at his tie. Doctor Copeland seemed about to speak, and then he wet his lips and was still silent.",0
5957,"'Willie, you were going pretty good with your harp,' said Portia finally. 'Look to me like you and Highboy must of got into somebody's gin bottle.'  'No, ma'am,' said Highboy very politely. 'Us haven't had anything since Saturday. Us have just been enjoying our horseshoe game. '",0
5958,"Doctor Copeland still did not speak, and they all kept glancing at him and waiting. The room was close and the quietness made everyone nervous. 'I do haves the hardest time with them boys' clothes,' Portia said. 'I washes both of them white suits ever Saturday and I presses them twice a week. And look at them now. Course they don't wear them except when they gets home from work. But after two days they seems to be potty black. I ironed them pants just last night and now there not a crease left.'",0
5959,"Still Doctor Copeland was silent. He kept his eyes on his son's face, but when Willie noticed this he bit his rough, blunt fingers and stared at his feet. Doctor Copeland felt his pulse hammering at his wrists and temples. He coughed and held his fist to his chest. He wanted to speak to his son, but he could think of nothing to say. The old bitterness came up in him and he did not have time to cogitate and push it down. His pulse hammered in him and he was confused. But they all looked at him, and the silence was so strong that he had to speak.",0
5960,"His voice was high and it did not sound as though it came from himself. 'William, I wonder how much of all the things I have said to you when you were a child have stayed in your mind. '",0
5961,"'I don't know what you m-m-means,' Willie said. The words came before Doctor Copeland knew what he would say. 'I mean that to you and Hamilton and Karl Marx I gave all that was in me. And I put all of my trust and hope in you. And all I get is blank misunderstanding and idleness and indifference. Of all I have put in nothing has remained. All has been taken away from me. All that I have tried to do----'  'Hush,' said Portia. '",0
5962,"Father, you promised me that us would not quarrel. This here is crazy. Us can't afford to quarrel.'",0
5963,Portia got up and started toward the front door. Willie and Highboy followed quickly. Doctor Copeland was the last to come.,0
5964,"They stood in the dark before the front door. Doctor Copeland tried to speak, but his voice seemed lost somewhere deep inside him. Willie and Portia and Highboy stood in a group together.",0
5965,With one arm Portia held to her husband and brother and with the other she reached out to Doctor Copeland. 'Less us all make up now before us goes. I can't stand this here fighting between us. Less us not ever quarrel no more.',0
5966,"In silence Doctor Copeland shook hands again with each of them. 'I am sorry,' he said. 'It quite all right with me,' said Highboy politely.",0
5967,"'It quite all right with me too,' Willie mumbled. Portia held all of their hands together. 'Us just can't afford to quarrel.'",0
5968,"They said good-bye, and Doctor Copeland watched them from the dark front porch as they went together up the street. Their footsteps as they walked away had a lonesome sound and he felt weak and tired. When they were a block away William began playing his harmonica again. The music was sad and empty. He stayed on the front porch until he could neither see nor hear them any longer.",0
5969,"Doctor Copeland turned off the lights in his house and sat in the dark before the stove. But peace would not come to him. He wanted to remove Hamilton and Karl Marx and William from his mind. Each word that Portia had said to him came back in a loud, hard way to his memory. He got up suddenly and turned on the light. He settled himself at the table with his books by Spinoza and William Shakespeare and Karl Marx. When he read the Spinoza aloud to himself the words had a rich, dark sound.",0
5970,"He thought of the white man of whom they had spoken. It would be good if the white man could help him with Augustus Benedict Mady Lewis, the deaf patient. It would be good to write to the white man even if he did not have this reason and these questions to ask. Doctor Copeland held his head in his hands and from his throat there came the strange sound like a kind of singing moan. He remembered the white man's face when he smiled behind the yellow match flame on that rainy night--and peace was in him.",0
5971,[6] By midsummer Singer had visitors more often than any other person in the house. From his room in the evening there was nearly always the sound of a voice. After dinner at the New York Café he bathed and dressed himself in one of his cool wash suits and as a rule did not go out again. The room was cool and pleasant. He had an ice box in the closet where he kept bottles of cold beer and fruit drinks. He was never busy or in a hurry. And always he met his guests at the door with a welcome smile.,0
5972,"Mick loved to go up to Mister Singer's room. Even if he was a deaf-and-dumb mute he understood every word she said to him. Talking with him was like a game. Only there was a whole lot more to it than any game. It was like finding out new things about music. She would tell him some of her plans that she would not tell anybody else. He let her meddle with his cute little chess men. Once when she was excited and caught her shirt-tail in the electric fan he acted in such a kindly way that she was not embarrassed at all. Except for her Dad, Mister Singer was the nicest man she knew.",0
5973,"When Doctor Copeland wrote the note to John Singer about Augustus Benedict Mady Lewis there was a polite reply and an invitation for him to make a call when he found the opportunity. Doctor Copeland went to the back of the house and sat with Portia awhile in the kitchen. Then he climbed the stairs to the white man's room. There was truly none of the quiet insolence about this man. They had a lemonade together and the mute wrote down the answer to the questions he wished to know. This man was different from any person of the white race whom Doctor Copeland had ever encountered. Afterward he pondered about this white man a long time. Then later, inasmuch as he had been invited in a cordial manner to return, he made another visit.",0
5974,"Jake Blount came every week. When he walked up to Singer's room the whole stairway shook. Usually he carried a paper sack of beers. Often his voice would come out loud and angry from the room. But before he left his voice gradually quieted. When he descended the stairs he did not carry the sack of beers any longer, and he walked away thoughtfully without seeming to notice where he was going.",0
5975,"Even Biff Brannon came to the mute's room one night. But as he could never stay away from the restaurant for long, he left in a half-hour. Singer was always the same to everyone. He sat in a straight chair by the window with his hands stuffed tight into his pockets, and nodded or smiled to show his guests that he understood.",0
5976,"If he did not have a visitor in the evening, Singer went to a late movie. He liked to sit back and watch the actors talking and walking about on the screen. He never looked at the title of a picture before going into a movie, and no matter what was showing he watched each scene with equal interest.",0
5977,"Then, one day in July, Singer suddenly went away without warning. He left the door of his room open, and on the table in an envelope addressed to Mrs. Kelly there were four dollars for the past week's rent. His few simple possessions were gone and the room was very clean and bare. When his visitors came and saw this empty room they went away with hurt surprise. No one could imagine why he had left like this.",0
5978,Singer spent all of his summer vacation in the town where Antonapoulos was being kept in the asylum. For months he had planned this trip and imagined about each moment they would have together. Two weeks beforehand his hotel reservation had been made and for a long time he had carried his railroad ticket in an envelope in his pocket.,0
5979,"Antonapoulos was not changed at all. When Singer came into his room he ambled placidly to meet his friend. He was even fatter than before, but the dreamy smile on his face was just the same. Singer had some packages in his arms and the big Greek gave them his first attention. His presents were a scarlet dressing-gown, soft bedroom slippers, and two monogrammed nightshirts. Antonapoulos looked beneath all the tissue papers in the boxes very carefully. When he saw that nothing good to eat had been concealed there, he dumped the gifts disdainfully on his bed and did not bother with them any more.",0
5980,"The room was large and sunny. Several beds were spaced in a row together. Three old men played a game of slapjack in a corner. They did not notice Singer or Antonapoulos, and the two friends sat alone on the other side of the room.",0
5981,It seemed to Singer that years had passed since they had been together. There was so much to say that his hands could not shape the signs with speed enough. His green eyes burned and sweat glittered on his forehead. The old feeling of gaiety and bliss was so quick in him again that he could not control himself.,0
5982,"Antonapoulos kept his dark, oily eyes on his friend and did not move. His hands fumbled languidly with the crotch of his trousers. Singer told him, among other things, about the visitors who had been coming to see him. He told his friend that they helped take his mind away from his lonesomeness. He told Antonapoulos that they were strange people and always talking--but that he liked to have them come. He drew quick sketches of Jake Blount and Mick and Doctor Copeland. Then as soon as he saw that Antonapoulos was not interested Singer crumpled the sketches and forgot about them. When the attendant came in to say that their time was up, Singer had not finished half of the things he wanted to say. But he left the room very tired and happy.",0
5983,"The patients could receive their friends only on Thursday and Sunday. On the days when he could not be with Antonapoulos, Singer walked up and down in his room at the hotel. His second visit to his friend was like the first, except that the old men in the room watched them listlessly and did not play slapjack.",0
5984,"After much trouble Singer obtained permission to take Antonapoulos out with him for a few hours. He planned each detail of the little excursion in advance. They drove out into the country in a taxi, and then at four-thirty they went to the dining-room at the hotel. Antonapoulos greatly enjoyed this extra meal. He ordered half the dishes on the menu and ate very greedily. But when he had finished he would not leave. He held to the table. Singer coaxed him and the cab driver wanted to use force. Antonapoulos sat stolidly and made obscene gestures when they came too close to him. At last Singer bought a bottle of whiskey from the hotel manager and lured him into the taxi again. When Singer threw the unopened bottle out of the window Antonapoulos wept with disappointment and offense. The end of their little excursion made Singer very sad.",0
5985,"His next visit was the last one, for his two weeks' vacation was almost over. Antonapoulos had forgotten what had happened before. They sat in their same corner of the room. The minutes slipped by quickly. Singer's hands talked desperately and his narrow face was very pale. At last it was time for him to go. He held his friend by the arm and looked into his face in the way that he used to do when they parted each day before work. Antonapoulos stared at him drowsily and did not move. Singer left the room with his hands stuffed hard into his pockets.",0
5986,"Soon after Singer returned to his room at the boarding-house, Mick and Jake Blount and Doctor Copeland began to come again. Each one of them wanted to know where he had been and why he had not let them know about his plans. But Singer pretended that he did not understand their questions, and his smile was inscrutable.",0
5987,One by one they would come to Singer's room to spend the evening with him. The mute was always thoughtful and composed. His many-tinted gentle eyes were grave as a sorcerer's. Mick Kelly and Jake Blount and Doctor Copeland would come and talk in the silent room--for they felt that the mute would always understand whatever they wanted to say to him. And maybe even more than that.,0
5988,PART TWO [1] This summer was different from any other time Mick could remember. Nothing much happened that she could describe to herself in thoughts or words--but there was a feeling of change. All the time she was excited. In the morning she couldn't wait to get out of bed and start going for the day. And at night she hated like hell to have to sleep again.,0
5989,"Right after breakfast she took the kids out, and except for meals they were gone most of the day. A good deal of the time they just roamed around the streets--with her pulling Ralph's wagon and Bubber following along behind. Always she was busy with thoughts and plans. Sometimes she would look up suddenly and they would be way off in some part of town she didn't even recognize. And once or twice they ran into Bill on the streets and she was so busy thinking he had to grab her by the arm to make her see him.",0
5990,"Early in the mornings it was a little cool and their shadows stretched out tall on the sidewalk in front of them. But in the middle of the day the sky was always blazing hot. The glare was so bright it hurt to keep your eyes open. A lot of times the plans about the things that were going to happen to her were mixed up with ice and snow. Sometimes it was like she was out in Switzerland and all the mountains were covered with snow and she was skating on cold, greenish-colored ice. Mister Singer would be skating with her. And maybe Carole Lombard or Arturo Toscanini who played on the radio. They would be skating together and then Mister Singer would fall through the ice and she would dive in without regard for peril and swim under the ice and save his life. That was one of the plans always going on in her mind.",0
5991,"Usually after they had walked awhile she would park Bubber and Ralph in some shady place. Bubber was a swell kid and she had trained him pretty good. If she told him not to go out of hollering distance from Ralph she wouldn't ever find him shooting marbles with kids two or three blocks away. He played by himself near the wagon, and when she left them she didn't have to worry much. She either went to the library and looked at the National Geographic or else just roamed around and thought some more. If she had any money she bought a dope or a Milky Way at Mister Brannon's. He gave kids a reduction. He sold them nickel things for three cents.",0
5992,"But all the time--no matter what she was doing--there was music. Sometimes she hummed to herself as she walked, and other times she listened quietly to the songs inside her. There were all kinds of music in her thoughts. Some she heard over radios, and some was in her mind already without her ever having heard it anywhere.",0
5993,"In the night-time, as soon as the kids were in bed, she was free. That was the most important time of all. A lot of things happened when she was by herself and it was dark. Right after supper she ran out of the house again. She couldn't tell anybody about the things she did at night, and when her Mama asked her questions she would answer with any little tale that sounded reasonable. But most of the time if anybody called her she just ran away like she hadn't heard. That went for everybody except her Dad. There was something about her Dad's voice she couldn't run away from. He was one of the biggest, tallest men in the whole town. But his voice was so quiet and kindly that people were surprised when he spoke. No matter how much of a hurry she was in, she always had to stop when her Dad called.",0
5994,This summer she realized something about her Dad she had never known before. Up until then she had never thought about him as being a real separate person. A lot of times he would call her. She would go in the front room where he worked and stand by him a couple of minutes--but when she listened to him her mind was never on the things he said to her. Then one night she suddenly realized about her Dad. Nothing unusual happened that night and she didn't know what it was that made her understand. Afterward she felt older and as though she knew him as good as she could know any person.,0
5995,"It was a night in late August and she was in a big rush. She had to be at this house by nine o'clock, and no maybe either. Her Dad called and she went into the front room. He was sitting slumped over his workbench. For some reason it never did seem natural to see him there. Until the time of his accident last year he had been a painter and carpenter. Before daylight every morning he would leave the house in his overalls, to be gone all day. Then at night sometimes he fiddled around with clocks as an extra work. A lot of times he had tried to get a job in a jewelry store where he could sit by himself at a desk all day with a clean white shirt on and a tie. Now when he couldn't carpenter any more he had put a sign at the front of the house reading 'Clocks and Watches Repaired Cheap.' But he didn't look like most jewelers--the ones downtown were quick, dark little Jew men. Her Dad was too tall for his workbench, and his big bones seemed joined together in a loose way.",0
5996,"Her Dad just stared at her. She could tell he didn't have any reason for calling. He only wanted real bad to talk to her. He tried to think of some way to begin. His brown eyes were too big for his long, thin face, and since he had lost every single hair the pale, bald top of his head gave him a naked look. He still looked at her without speaking and she was in a hurry. She had to be at that house by nine sharp and there was no time to waste. Her Dad saw she was in a hurry and he cleared his throat.",0
5997,"'I got something for you,' he said. 'Nothing much, but maybe you can treat yourself with it.' He didn't have to give her any nickel or dime just because he was lonesome and wanted to talk. Out of what he made he only kept enough to have beer about twice a week. Two bottles were on the floor by his chair now, one empty and one just opened. And whenever he drank beer he liked to talk to somebody. Her Dad fumbled with his belt and she looked away. This summer he had gotten like a kid about hiding those nickels and dimes he kept for himself. Sometimes he hid them in his shoes, and other times in a little slit he had cut in his belt. She only halfway wanted to take the dime, but when he held it out her hand was just naturally open and ready.",0
5998,"'I got so much work to do I don't know where to begin,' he said. That was just the opposite to the truth, and he knew it good as she did. He never had many watches to fix, and when he finished he would fool around the house doing any little job that was needed. Then at night he sat at his bench, cleaning old springs and wheels and trying to make the work last out until bedtime. Ever since he broke his hip and couldn't work steady he had to be doing something every minute.",0
5999,"'I been thinking a lot tonight,' her Dad said. He poured out his beer and sprinkled a few grains of salt on the back of his hand. Then he licked up the salt and took a swallow out of the glass.",0
6000,She was in such a hurry that it was hard to stand still. Her Dad noticed this. He tried to say something--but he had not called to tell her anything special. He only wanted to talk with her for a little while. He started to speak and swallowed. They just looked at each other. The quietness grew out longer and neither of them could say a word.,0
6001,That was when she realized about her Dad. It wasn't like she was learning a new fact--she had understood it all along in every way except with her brain. Now she just suddenly knew that she knew about her Dad. He was lonesome and he was an old man. Because none of the kids went to him for anything and because he didn't earn much money he felt like he was cut off from the family. And in his lonesomeness he wanted to be close to one of his kids--and they were all so busy that they didn't know it. He felt like he wasn't much real use to anybody.,0
6002,She understood this while they were looking at each other. It gave her a queer feeling. Her Dad picked up a watch spring and cleaned it with a brush dipped in gasoline.,0
6003,"'I know you're in a hurry. I just hollered to say hello.' 'No, I'm not in any rush,' she said. 'Honest.'",0
6004,"That night she sat down in a chair by his bench and they talked awhile. He talked about accounts and expenses and how things would have been if he had just managed in a different way. He drank beer, and once the tears came to his eyes and he snuffled his nose against his shirt-sleeve. She stayed with him a good while that night. Even if she was in an awful hurry. Yet for some reason she couldn't tell him about the things in her mind--about the hot, dark nights.",0
6005,"These nights were secret, and of the whole summer they were the most important time. In the dark she walked by herself and it was like she was the only person in the town. Almost every street came to be as plain to her in the night-time as her own home block. Some kids were afraid to walk through strange places in the dark, but she wasn't. Girls were scared a man would come out from somewhere and put his teapot in them like they was married. Most girls were nuts. If a person the size of Joe Louis or Mountain Man Dean would jump out at her and want to fight she would run. But if it was somebody within twenty pounds her weight she would give him a good sock and go right on.",0
6006,"The nights were wonderful, and she didn't have time to think about such things as being scared. Whenever she was in the dark she thought about music. While she walked along the streets she would sing to herself. And she felt like the whole town listened without knowing it was Mick Kelly.",0
6007,"She learned a lot about music during these free nights in the summer-time. When she walked out in the rich parts of town every house had a radio. All the windows were open and she could hear the music very marvelous. After a while she knew which houses tuned in for the programs she wanted to hear. There was one special house that got all the good orchestras. And at night she would go to this house and sneak into the dark yard to listen. There was beautiful shrubbery around this house, and she would sit under a bush near the window. And after it was all over she would stand in the dark yard with her hands in her pockets and think for a long time. That was the realest part of all the summer--her listening to this music on the radio and studying about it.",0
6008,"* * * * *  'Cerra la puerta, señor,' Mick said. Bubber was sharp as a briar. 'Haga me usted el favor, señorita,' he answered as a comeback.",0
6009,"It was grand to take Spanish at Vocational. There was something about speaking in a foreign language that made her feel like she'd been around a lot. Every afternoon since school had started she had fun speaking the new Spanish words and sentences. At first Bubber was stumped, and it was funny to watch his face while she talked the foreign language. Then he caught on in a hurry, and before long he could copy everything she said. He remembered the words he learned, too. Of course he didn't know what all the sentences meant, but she didn't say them for the sense they made, anyway. After a while the kid learned so fast she gave out of Spanish and just gabbled along with made-up sounds. But it wasn't long before he caught her out at that--nobody could put a thing over on old Bubber Kelly.",0
6010,"'I'm going to pretend like I'm walking into this house for the first time,' Mick said. ' Then I can tell better if all the decoration looks good or not.'",0
6011,She walked out on the front porch and then came back and stood in the hall. All day she and Bubber and Portia and her Dad had been fixing the hall and the dining-room for the party. The decoration was autumn leaves and vines and red crêpe paper. On the mantelpiece in the dining-room and sticking up behind the hatrack there were bright yellow leaves. They had trailed vines along the walls and on the table where the punch bowl would be. The red crêpe paper hung down in long fringes from the mantel and also was looped around the backs of the chairs. There was plenty decoration. It was O.K.  She rubbed her hand on her forehead and squinted her eyes.,0
6012,Bubber stood beside her and copied every move she made. 'I sure do want this party to turn out all right. I sure do.',0
6013,"This would be the first party she had ever given. She had never even been to more than four or five. Last summer she had gone to a prom party. But none of the boys asked her to prom or dance, so she just stood by the punch bowl until all the refreshments were gone and then went home. This party was not going to be a bit like that one. In a few hours now the people she had invited would start coming and the to-do would begin.",0
6014,"It was hard to remember just how she got the idea of this party. The notion came to her soon after she started at Vocational. High School was swell. Everything about it was different from Grammar School. She wouldn't have liked it so much if she had had to take a stenographic course like Hazel and Etta had done--but she got special permission and took mechanical shop like a boy. Shop and Algebra and Spanish were grand. English was mighty hard. Her English teacher was Miss Minner. Everybody said Miss Minner had sold her brains to a famous doctor for ten thousand dollars, so that after she was dead he could cut them up and see why she was so smart. On written lessons she cracked such questions as 'Name eight famous contemporaries of Doctor Johnson,' and 'Quote ten lines from ""The Vicar of Wakefield.""' She called on people by the alphabet and kept her grade book open during the lessons. And even if she was brainy she was an old sourpuss. The Spanish teacher had traveled once in Europe. She said that in France the people carried home loaves of bread without having them wrapped up. They would stand talking on the streets and hit the bread on a lamp post. And there wasn't any water in France--only wine.",0
6015,"In nearly all ways Vocational was wonderful. They walked back and forth in the hall between classes, and at lunch period students hung around the gym. Here was the thing that soon began to bother her. In the halls the people would walk up and down together and everybody seemed to belong to some special bunch. Within a week or two she knew people in the halls and in classes to speak to them--but that was all. She wasn't a member of any bunch. In Grammar School she would have just gone up to any crowd she wanted to belong with and that would have been the end of the matter. Here it was different.",0
6016,During the first week she walked up and down the halls by herself and thought about this. She planned about being with some bunch almost as much as she thought of music. Those two things were in her head all the time. And finally she got the idea of the party.,0
6017,"She was strict with the invitations. No Grammar School kids and nobody under twelve years old. She just asked people between thirteen and fifteen. She knew everybody she invited good enough to speak to them in the halls--and when she didn't know their names she asked to find out. She called up those who had a telephone, and the rest she invited at school.",0
6018,"On the telephone she always said the same thing. She let Bubber stick in his ear to listen. 'This is Mick Kelly,' she said. If they didn't understand the name she kept on until they got it. 'I'm having a prom party at eight o'clock Saturday night and I'm inviting you now. I live at 103 Fourth Street, Apartment A.' That Apartment A sounded swell on the telephone. Nearly everybody said they would be delighted. A couple of tough boys tried to be smarty and kept on asking her name over and over. One of them tried to act cute and said, 'I don't know you.' She squelched him in a hurry: 'You go eat grass!' Outside of that wise guy there were ten boys and ten girls and she knew that they were all coming. This was a real party, and it would be better than and different from any party she had ever gone to or heard about before.",0
6019,"Mick looked over the hall and dining-room one last time. By the hatrack she stopped before the picture of Old Dirty-Face. This was a photo of her Mama's grandfather. He was a major way back in the Civil War and had been killed in a battle. Some kid once drew eyeglasses and a beard on his picture, and when the pencil marks were erased it left his face all dirty. That was why she called him Old Dirty-Face. The picture was in the middle of a three-part frame. On both sides were pictures of his sons. They looked about Bubber's age. They had on uniforms and their faces were surprised. They had been killed in a battle also. A long time ago.",0
6020,'I'm going to take this down for the party. I think it looks common. Don't you?',0
6021,"'I don't know,' Bubber said. 'Are we common, Mick?'  'I'm not. '",0
6022,She put the picture underneath the hatrack. The decoration was O.K. Mister Singer would be pleased when he came home. The rooms seemed very empty and quiet. The table was set for supper. And then after supper it would be time for the party. She went into the kitchen to see about the refreshments.,0
6023,'You think everything will be all right?' she asked Portia. Portia was making biscuits. The refreshments were on top of the stove. There were peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and chocolate snaps and punch. The sandwiches were covered with a damp dishcloth. She peeped at them but didn't take one.,0
6024,"'I done told you forty times that everthing going to be all right,' Portia said. 'Just soon as I come back from fixing supper at home I going to put on that white apron and serve the food real nice. Then I going to push off from here by nine-thirty. This here is Saturday night and Highboy and Willie and me haves our plans, too.'",0
6025,"'Sure,' Mick said. 'I just want you to help out till things sort of get started--you know. '",0
6026,She gave in and took one of the sandwiches. Then she made Bubber stay with Portia and went into the middle room. The dress she would wear was laying out on the bed. Hazel and Etta had both been good about lending her their best clothes--considering that they weren't supposed to come to the party. There was Etta's long blue crêpe de chine evening dress and some white pumps and a rhinestone tiara for her hair. These clothes were really gorgeous. It was hard to imagine how she would look in them.,0
6027,"The late afternoon had come and the sun made long, yellow slants through the window. If she took two hours over dressing for the party it was time to begin now. When she thought about putting on the fine clothes she couldn't just sit around and wait. Very slowly she went into the bathroom and shucked off her old shorts and shirt and turned on the water. She scrubbed the rough parts of her heels and her knees and especially her elbows. She made the bath take a long time.",0
6028,"She ran naked into the middle room and began to dress. Silk teddies she put on, and silk stockings. She even wore one of Etta's brassières just for the heck of it. Then very carefully she put on the dress and stepped into the pumps. This was the first time she had ever worn an evening dress. She stood for a long time before the mirror. She was so tall that the dress came up two or three inches above her ankles--and the shoes were so short they hurt her. She stood in front of the mirror a long time, and finally decided she either looked like a sap or else she looked very beautiful. One or the other.",0
6029,"Six different ways she tried out her hair. The cowlicks were a little trouble, so she wet her bangs and made three spit curls. Last of all she stuck the rhinestones in her hair and put on plenty of lipstick and paint. When she finished she lifted up her chin and half-closed her eyes like a movie star. Slowly she turned her face from one side to the other. It was beautiful she looked--just beautiful.",0
6030,"She didn't feel like herself at all. She was somebody different from Mick Kelly entirely. Two hours had to pass before the party would begin, and she was ashamed for any of the family to see her dressed so far ahead of time. She went into the bathroom again and locked the door. She couldn't mess up her dress by sitting down, so she stood in the middle of the floor. The close walls around her seemed to press in all the excitement. She felt so different from the old Mick Kelly that she knew this would be better than anything else in all her whole life--this party.",0
6031,* * * * *  'Yippee! The punch!'  'The cutest dress----'  'Say!,0
6032,"You solve that one about the triangle forty-six by twen----'  'Lemme by! Move out my way!' The front door slammed every second as the people swarmed into the house. Sharp voices and soft voices sounded together until there was just one roaring noise. Girls stood in bunches in their long, fine evening dresses, and the boys roamed around in clean duck pants or R.O.T.C. uniforms or new dark fall suits. There was so much commotion that Mick couldn't notice any separate face or person. She stood by the hatrack and stared around at the party as a whole.",0
6033,"'Everybody get a prom card and start signing up.' At first the room was too loud for anyone to hear and pay attention. The boys were so thick around the punch bowl that the table and the vines didn't show at all. Only her Dad's face rose up above the boys' heads as he smiled and dished up the punch into the little paper cups. On the seat of the hatrack beside her were a jar of candy and two handkerchiefs. A couple of girls thought it was her birthday, and she had thanked them and unwrapped the presents without telling them she wouldn't be fourteen for eight more months. Every person was as clean and fresh and dressed up as she was. They smelled good. The boys had their hair plastered down wet and slick. The girls with their different-colored long dresses stood together, and they were like a bright hunk of flowers. The start was marvelous. The beginning of this party was O.K.  'I'm part Scotch-Irish and French and----'  'I got German blood----'",0
6034,She hollered about the prom cards one more time before she went into the dining-room. Soon they began to pile in from the hall. Every person took a prom card and they lined up in bunches against the walls of the room. This was the real start now.,0
6035,"It came all of a sudden in a very queer way--this quietness. The boys stood together on one side of the room and the girls were across from them. For some reason every person quit making noise at once. The boys held their cards and looked at the girls and the room was very still. None of the boys started asking for proms like they were supposed to do. The awful quietness got worse and she had not been to enough parties to know what she should do. Then the boys started punching each other and talking. The girls giggled--but even if they didn't look at the boys you could tell they only had their minds on whether they were going to be popular or not. The awful quietness was gone now, but there was something jittery about the room.",0
6036,"After a while a boy went up to a girl named Delores Brown. As soon as he had signed her up the other boys all began to rush Delores at once. When her whole card was full they started on another girl, named Mary. After that everything suddenly stopped again. One or two extra girls got a couple of proms--and because she was giving the party three boys came up to her. That was all.",0
6037,The people just hung around in the dining-room and the hall. The boys mostly flocked around the punch bowl and tried to show off with each other. The girls bunched together and did a lot of laughing to pretend like they were having a good time. The boys thought about the girls and the girls thought about the boys. But all that came of it was a queer feeling in the room.,0
6038,"It was then she began to notice Harry Minowitz. He lived in the house next door and she had known him all her life. Although he was two years older she had grown faster than him, and in the summer-time they used to wrestle and fight out on the plot of grass by the street. Harry was a Jew boy, but he did not look so much like one. His hair was light brown and straight. Tonight he was dressed very neat, and when he came in the door he had hung a grown man's panama hat with a feather in it on the hatrack.",0
6039,"It wasn't his clothes that made her notice him. There was something changed about his face because he was without the horn-rimmed specs he usually wore. A red, droopy sty had come out on one of his eyes and he had to cock his head sideways like a bird in order to see. His long, thin hands kept touching around his sty as though it hurt him. When he asked for punch he stuck the paper cup right into her Dad's face. She could tell he needed his glasses very bad. He was nervous and kept bumping into people. He didn't ask any girl to prom except her--and that was because it was her party.",0
6040,"All the punch had been drunk. Her Dad was afraid she would be embarrassed, so he and her Mama had gone back to the kitchen to make lemonade. Some of the people were on the front porch and the sidewalk. She was glad to get out in the cool night air. After the hot, bright house she could smell the new autumn in the darkness.",0
6041,Then she saw something she hadn't expected. Along the edge of the sidewalk and in the dark street there was a bunch of neighborhood kids. Pete and Sucker Wells and Baby and Spareribs--the whole gang that started at below Bubber's age and went on up to over twelve. There were even kids she didn't know at all who had somehow smelled a party and come to hang around. And there were kids her age and older that she hadn't invited either because they had done something mean to her or she had done something mean to them. They were all dirty and in plain shorts or draggle-tailed knickers or old everyday dresses. They were just hanging around in the dark to watch the party. She thought of two feelings when she saw those kids--one was sad and the other was a kind of warning.,0
6042,"'I got this prom with you.' Harry Minowitz made out like he was reading on his card, but she could see nothing was written on it. Her Dad had come onto the porch and blown the whistle that meant the beginning of the first prom.",0
6043,"'Yeah,' she said. 'Let's get going.' They started out to walk around the block. In the long dress she still felt very ritzy. 'Look yonder at Mick Kelly!' one of the kids in the dark hollered. 'Look at her!' She just walked on like she hadn't heard, but it was that Spareribs, and some day soon she would catch him. She and Harry walked fast along the dark sidewalk, and when they came to the end of the street they turned down another block.",0
6044,"'How old are you now, Mick--thirteen?'  'Going on fourteen.' She knew what he was thinking. It used to worry her all the time. Five feet six inches tall and a hundred and three pounds, and she was only thirteen. Every kid at the party was a runt beside her, except Harry, who was only a couple of inches shorter. No boy wanted to prom with a girl so much taller than him. But maybe cigarettes would help stunt the rest of her growth.",0
6045,"'I grew three and a fourth inches just in last year,' she said. 'Once I saw a lady at the fair who was eight and a half feet tall. But you probably won't grow that big.'",0
6046,Harry stopped beside a dark crêpe myrtle bush. Nobody was in sight. He took something out of his pocket and started fooling with whatever it was. She leaned over to see--it was his pair of specs and he was wiping them with his handkerchief.,0
6047,"'Pardon me,' he said. Then he put on his glasses and she could hear him breathe deep. 'You ought to wear your specs all the time. '",0
6048,"'Yeah.'  'How come you go around without them?' 'Oh, I don't know----'  The night was very quiet and dark. Harry held her elbow when they crossed the street.",0
6049,"'There's a certain young lady back at the party that thinks it's sissy for a fellow to wear glasses. This certain person--oh well, maybe I am a----'  He didn't finish. Suddenly he tightened up and ran a few steps and sprang for a leaf about four feet above his head. She just could see that high leaf in the dark. He had a good spring to his jumping and he got it the first time. Then he put the leaf in his mouth and shadowboxed for a few punches in the dark. She caught up with him.",0
6050,As usual a song was in her mind. She was humming to herself. 'What's that you're singing?',0
6051,'It's a piece by a fellow named Mozart.' Harry felt pretty good. He was sidestepping with his feet like a fast boxer. ' That sounds like a sort of German name. ',0
6052,"'I reckon so.'  'Fascist?' he asked. 'What?'  'I say is that Mozart a Fascist or a Nazi?'  Mick thought a minute. 'No. They're new, and this fellow's been dead some time. '",0
6053,'It's a good thing.' He began punching in the dark again. He wanted her to ask why.,0
6054,"'I say it's a good thing,' he said again. 'Why?'  'Because I hate Fascists. If I met one walking on the street I'd kill him. '",0
6055,"She looked at Harry. The leaves against the street light made quick, freckly shadows on his face. He was excited.",0
6056,"'How come?' she asked. 'Gosh! Don't you ever read the paper? You see, it's this way----'  They had come back around the block.",0
6057,A commotion was going on at her house. People were yelling and running on the sidewalk. A heavy sickness came in her belly.,0
6058,'There's not time to explain unless we prom around the block again. I don't mind telling you why I hate Fascists. I'd like to tell about it. ',0
6059,"This was probably the first chance he had got to spiel these ideas out to somebody. But she didn't have time to listen. She was busy looking at what she saw in the front of her house. ' O.K. I'll see you later.' The prom was over now, so she could look and put her mind on the mess she saw.",0
6060,What had happened while she was gone? When she left the people were standing around in the fine clothes and it was a real party. Now--after just five minutes--the place looked more like a crazy house. While she was gone those kids had come out of the dark and right into the party itself. The nerve they had! There was old Pete Wells banging out of the front door with a cup of punch in his hand. They bellowed and ran and mixed with the invited people--in their old loose-legged knickers and everyday clothes.,0
6061,"Baby Wilson messed around on the front porch--and Baby wasn't more than four years old. Anybody could see she ought to be home in bed by now, same as Bubber. She walked down the steps one at a time, holding the punch high up over her head. There was no reason for her to be here at all. Mister Brannon was her uncle and she could get free candy and drinks at his place any time she wanted to. As soon as she was on the sidewalk Mick caught her by the arm. 'You go right home, Baby Wilson. Go on, now.' Mick looked around to see what else she could do to straighten things out again like they ought to be. She went up to Sucker Wells. He stood farther down the sidewalk, where it was dark, holding his paper cup and looking at everybody in a dreamy way. Sucker was seven years old and he had on shorts. His chest and feet were naked. He wasn't causing any of the commotion, but she was mad as hell at what had happened.",0
6062,"She grabbed Sucker by the shoulders and began to shake him. At first he held his jaws tight, but after a minute his teeth began to rattle. 'You go home, Sucker Wells. You quit hanging around where you're not invited.' When she let him go, Sucker tucked his tail and walked slowly down the street. But he didn't go all the way home. After he got to the corner she saw him sit down on the curb and watch the party where he thought she couldn't see him.",0
6063,"For a minute she felt good about shaking the spit out of Sucker. And then right afterward she had a bad worry feeling in her and she started to let him come back. The big kids were the ones who messed up everything. Real brats they were, and with the worst nerve she had ever seen. Drinking up the refreshments and ruining the real party into all this commotion. They slammed through the front door and hollered and bumped into each other. She went up to Pete Wells because he was the worst of all. He wore his football helmet and butted into people. Pete was every bit of fourteen, yet he was still stuck in the seventh grade. She went up to him, but he was too big to shake like Sucker. When she told him to go home he shimmied and made a nose dive at her.",0
6064,"'I been in six different states. Florida, Alabama----'  'Made out of silver cloth with a sash----'  The party was all messed up. Everybody was talking at once. The invited people from Vocational were mixed with the neighborhood gang. The boys and the girls still stood in separate bunches, though--and nobody prommed. In the house the lemonade was just about gone. There was only a little puddle of water with floating lemon peels at the bottom of the bowl. Her Dad always acted too nice with kids. He had served out the punch to anybody who stuck a cup at him. Portia was serving the sandwiches when she went into the dining-room. In five minutes they were all gone. She only got one--a jelly kind with pink sops come through the bread.",0
6065,"Portia stayed in the dining-room to watch the party. 'I having too good a time to leave,' she said. 'I done sent word to Highboy and Willie to go on with the Saturday Night without me. Everbody so excited here I going to wait and see the end of this party. '",0
6066,"Excitement--that was the word. She could feel it all through the room and on the porch and the sidewalk. She felt excited, too. It wasn't just her dress and the beautiful way her face looked when she passed by the hatrack mirror and saw the red paint on her cheeks and the rhinestone tiara in her hair. Maybe it was the decoration and all these Vocational people and kids being jammed together.",0
6067,"'Watch her run!'  'Ouch! Cut it out----'  'Act your age!' A bunch of girls were running down the street, holding up their dresses and with their hair flying out behind them. Some boys had cut off the long, sharp spears of a Spanish bayonet bush and they were chasing the girls with them. Freshmen in Vocational all dressed up for a real prom party and acting just like kids. It was half playlike and half not playlike at all. A boy came up to her with a sticker and she started running too.",0
6068,"The idea of the party was over entirely now. This was just a regular playing-out. But it was the wildest night she had ever seen. The kids had caused it. They were like a catching sickness, and their coming to the party made all the other people forget about High School and being almost grown. It was like just before you take a bath in the afternoon when you might wallow around in the back yard and get plenty dirty just for the good feel of it before getting into the tub. Everybody was a wild kid playing out on Saturday night--and she felt like the very wildest of all.",0
6069,She hollered and pushed and was the first to try any new stunt. She made so much noise and moved around so fast she couldn't notice what anybody else was doing. Her breath wouldn't come fast enough to let her do all the wild things she wanted to do.,0
6070,'The ditch down the street! The ditch! The ditch!',0
6071,She started for it first. Down a block they had put in new pipes under the street and dug a swell deep ditch. The flambeaux around the edge were bright and red in the dark. She wouldn't wait to climb down. She ran until she reached the little wavy flames and then she jumped.,0
6072,With her tennis shoes she would have landed like a cat--but the high pumps made her slip and her stomach hit this pipe. Her breath was stopped. She lay quiet with her eyes closed.,0
6073,"The party---- For a long time she remembered how she thought it would be, how she imagined the new people at Vocational. And about the bunch she wanted to be with every day. She would feel different in the halls now, knowing that they were not something special but like any other kids. It was O.K. about the ruined party. But it was all over. It was the end.",0
6074,"Mick climbed out of the ditch. Some kids were playing around the little pots of flames. The fire made a red glow and there were long, quick shadows. One boy had gone home and put on a dough-face bought in advance for Hallowe'en. Nothing was changed about the party except her.",0
6075,She walked home slowly. When she passed kids she didn't speak or look at them. The decoration in the hall was torn down and the house seemed very empty because everyone had gone outside. In the bathroom she took off the blue evening dress. The hem was torn and she folded it so the raggedy place wouldn't show. The rhinestone tiara was lost somewhere. Her old shorts and shirt were lying on the floor just where she had left them. She put them on. She was too big to wear shorts any more after this. No more after this night. Not any more.,0
6076,Mick stood out on the front porch. Her face was very white without the paint. She cupped her hands before her mouth and took a deep breath. 'Everybody go home! The door is shut! The party is over!',0
6077,"* * * * *  In the quiet, secret night she was by herself again. It was not late--yellow squares of light showed in the windows of the houses along the streets. She walked slow, with her hands in her pockets and her head to one side. For a long time she walked without noticing the direction.",0
6078,Then the houses were far apart from each other and there were yards with big trees in them and black shrubbery. She looked around and saw she was near this house where she had gone so many times in the summer. Her feet had just taken her here without her knowing. When she came to the house she waited to be sure no person could see. Then she went through the side yard.,0
6079,The radio was on as usual. For a second she stood by the window and watched the people inside. The bald-headed man and the gray-haired lady were playing cards at a table. Mick sat on the ground. This was a very fine and secret place. Close around were thick cedars so that she was completely hidden by herself. The radio was no good tonight--somebody sang popular songs that all ended in the same way. It was like she was empty. She reached in her pockets and felt around with her fingers. There were raisins and a buckeye and a string of beads--one cigarette with matches. She lighted the cigarette and put her arms around her knees. It was like she was so empty there wasn't even a feeling or thought in her.,0
6080,"One program came on after another, and all of them were punk. She didn't especially care. She smoked and picked a little bunch of grass blades. After a while a new announcer started talking. He mentioned Beethoven. She had read in the library about that musician--his name was pronounced with an a and spelled with double e. He was a German fellow like Mozart. When he was living he spoke in a foreign language and lived in a foreign place--like she wanted to do. The announcer said they were going to play his third symphony. She only halfway listened because she wanted to walk some more and she didn't care much what they played. Then the music started. Mick raised her head and her fist went up to her throat.",0
6081,"How did it come? For a minute the opening balanced from one side to the other. Like a walk or march. Like God strutting in the night. The outside of her was suddenly froze and only that first part of the music was hot inside her heart. She could not even hear what sounded after, but she sat there waiting and froze, with her fists tight. After a while the music came again, harder and loud. It didn't have anything to do with God. This was her, Mick Kelly, walking in the daytime and by herself at night. In the hot sun and in the dark with all the plans and feelings. This music was her--the real plain her.",0
6082,"She could not listen good enough to hear it all. The music boiled inside her. Which? To hang on to certain wonderful parts and think them over so that later she would not forget--or should she let go and listen to each part that came without thinking or trying to remember? Golly! The whole world was this music and she could not listen hard enough. Then at last the opening music came again, with all the different instruments bunched together for each note like a hard, tight fist that socked at her heart. And the first part was over.",0
6083,"This music did not take a long time or a short time. It did not have anything to do with time going by at all. She sat with her arms held tight around her legs, biting her salty knee very hard. It might have been five minutes she listened or half the night. The second part was black-colored--a slow march. Not sad, but like the whole world was dead and black and there was no use thinking back how it was before. One of those horn kind of instruments played a sad and silver tune. Then the music rose up angry and with excitement underneath. And finally the black march again.",0
6084,"But maybe the last part of the symphony was the music she loved the best--glad and like the greatest people in the world running and springing up in a hard, free way. Wonderful music like this was the worst hurt there could be. The whole world was this symphony, and there was not enough of her to listen.",0
6085,"It was over, and she sat very stiff with her arms around her knees. Another program came on the radio and she put her fingers in her ears. The music left only this bad hurt in her, and a blankness. She could not remember any of the symphony, not even the last few notes. She tried to remember, but no sound at all came to her. Now that it was over there was only her heart like a rabbit and this terrible hurt.",0
6086,"The radio and the lights in the house were turned off. The night was very dark. Suddenly Mick began hitting her thigh with her fists. She pounded the same muscle with all her strength until the tears came down her face. But she could not feel this hard enough. The rocks under the bush were sharp. She grabbed a handful of them and began scraping them up and down on the same spot until her hand was bloody. Then she fell back to the ground and lay looking up at the night. With the fiery hurt in her leg she felt better. She was limp on the wet grass, and after a while her breath came slow and easy again.",0
6087,"Why hadn't the explorers known by looking at the sky that the world was round? The sky was curved, like the inside of a huge glass ball, very dark blue with the sprinkles of bright stars. The night was quiet. There was the smell of warm cedars. She was not trying to think of the music at all when it came back to her. The first part happened in her mind just as it had been played. She listened in a quiet, slow way and thought the notes out like a problem in geometry so she would remember. She could see the shape of the sounds very clear and she would not forget them.",0
6088,"Now she felt good. She whispered some words out loud: 'Lord forgiveth me, for I knoweth not what I do.' Why did she think of that? Everybody in the past few years knew there wasn't any real God. When she thought of what she used to imagine was God she could only see Mister Singer with a long, white sheet around him. God was silent--maybe that was why she was reminded. She said the words again, just as she would speak them to Mister Singer: 'Lord forgiveth me, for I knoweth not what I do. '",0
6089,"This part of the music was beautiful and clear. She could sing it now whenever she wanted to. Maybe later on, when she had just waked up some morning, more of the music would come back to her. If ever she heard the symphony again there would be other parts to add to what was already in her mind. And maybe if she could hear it four more times, just four more times, she would know it all. Maybe.",0
6090,"Once again she listened to this opening part of the music. Then the notes grew slower and soft and it was like she was sinking down slowly into the dark ground. Mick awoke with a jerk. The air had turned chilly, and as she was coming up out of the sleep she dreamed old Etta Kelly was taking all the cover. 'Gimme some blanket----' she tried to say. Then she opened her eyes. The sky was very black and all the stars were gone. The grass was wet. She got up in a hurry because her Dad would be worried. Then she remembered the music. She couldn't tell whether the time was midnight or three in the morning, so she started beating it for home in a rush. The air had a smell in it like autumn. The music was loud and quick in her mind, and she ran faster and faster on the sidewalks leading to the home block.",0
6091,"[2] By October the days were blue and cool. Biff Brannon changed his light seersucker trousers for dark-blue serge ones. Behind the counter of the café he installed a machine that made hot chocolate. Mick was very partial to hot chocolate, and she came in three or four times a week to drink a cup. He served it to her for a nickel instead of a dime and he wanted to give it to her free. He watched her as she stood behind the counter and he was troubled and sad. He wanted to reach out his hand and touch her sunburned, tousled hair--but not as he had ever touched a woman. In him there was an uneasiness, and when he spoke to her his voice had a rough, strange sound.",0
6092,"There were many worries on his mind. For one thing, Alice was not well. She worked downstairs as usual from seven in the morning until ten at night, but she walked very slowly and brown circles were beneath her eyes. It was in the business that she showed this illness most plainly. One Sunday, when she wrote out the day's menu on the typewriter, she marked the special dinner with chicken à la king at twenty cents instead of fifty, and did not discover the mistake until several customers had already ordered and were ready to pay. Another time she gave back two fives and three ones as change for ten dollars. Biff would stand looking at her for a long time, rubbing his nose thoughtfully and with his eyes half-closed.",0
6093,"They did not speak of this together. At night he worked downstairs while she slept, and during the morning she managed the restaurant alone. When they worked together he stayed behind the cash register and looked after the kitchen and the tables, as was their custom. They did not talk except on matters of business, but Biff would stand watching her with his face puzzled.",0
6094,Then in the afternoon of the eighth of October there was a sudden cry of pain from the room where they slept. Biff hurried upstairs. Within an hour they had taken Alice to the hospital and the doctor had removed from her a tumor almost the size of a new-born child. And then within another hour Alice was dead.,0
6095,Biff sat by her bed at the hospital in stunned reflection. He had been present when she died. Her eyes had been drugged and misty from the ether and then they hardened like glass. The nurse and the doctor withdrew from the room. He continued to look into her face. Except for the bluish pallor there was little difference. He noted each detail about her as though he had not watched her every day for twenty-one years. Then gradually as he sat there his thoughts turned to a picture that had long been stored inside him.,0
6096,"The cold green ocean and a hot gold strip of sand. The little children playing on the edge of the silky line of foam. The sturdy brown baby girl, the thin little naked boys, the half-grown children running and calling out to each other with sweet, shrill voices. Children were here whom he knew, Mick and his niece, Baby, and there were also strange young faces no one had ever seen before. Biff bowed his head.",0
6097,"After a long while he got up from his chair and stood in the middle of the room. He could hear his sister-in-law, Lucile, walking up and down the hall outside. A fat bee crawled across the top of the dresser, and adroitly Biff caught it in his hand and put it out the open window. He glanced at the dead face one more time, and then with widowed sedateness he opened the door that led out into the hospital corridor.",0
6098,"Late the next morning he sat sewing in the room upstairs. Why? Why was it that in cases of real love the one who is left does not more often follow the beloved by suicide? Only because the living must bury the dead? Because of the measured rites that must be fulfilled after a death? Because it is as though the one who is left steps for a time upon a stage and each second swells to an unlimited amount of time and he is watched by many eyes? Because there is a function he must carry out? Or perhaps, when there is love, the widowed must stay for the resurrection of the beloved--so that the one who has gone is not really dead, but grows and is created for a second time in the soul of the living? Why?  Biff bent close over his sewing and meditated on many things.",0
6099,"He sewed skillfully, and the calluses on the tips of his fingers were so hard that he pushed the needle through the cloth without a thimble. Already the mourning bands had been sewn around the arms of two gray suits, and now he was on the last. The day was bright and hot, and the first dead leaves of the new autumn scraped on the sidewalks. He had gone out early. Each minute was very long. Before him there was infinite leisure. He had locked the door of the restaurant and hung on the outside a white wreath of lilies. To the funeral home he went first and looked carefully at the selection of caskets. He touched the materials of the linings and tested the strength of the frames.",0
6100,"'What is the name of the crêpe of this one--Georgette?' The undertaker answered his questions in an oily, unctuous voice. ' And what is the percentage of cremations in your business?'",0
6101,"Out on the street again Biff walked with measured formality. From the west there was a warm wind and the sun was very bright. His watch had stopped, so he turned down toward the street where Wilbur Kelly had recently put out his sign as watchmaker. Kelly was sitting at his bench in a patched bathrobe. His shop was also a bedroom, and the baby Mick pulled around with her in a wagon sat quietly on a pallet on the floor. Each minute was so long that in it there was ample time for contemplation and enquiry. He asked Kelly to explain the exact use of jewels in a watch. He noted the distorted look of Kelly's right eye as it appeared through his watchmaker's loupe. They talked for a while about Chamberlain and Munich. Then as the time was still early he decided to go up to the mute's room.",0
6102,"Singer was dressing for work. Last night there had come from him a letter of condolence. He was to be a pallbearer at the funeral. Biff sat on the bed and they smoked a cigarette together. Singer looked at him now and then with his green observant eyes. He offered him a drink of coffee. Biff did not talk, and once the mute stopped to pat him on the shoulder and look for a second into his face. When Singer was dressed they went out together.",0
6103,Biff bought the black ribbon at the store and saw the preacher of Alice's church. When all was arranged he came back home. To put things in order--that was the thought in his mind. He bundled up Alice's clothes and personal possessions to give to Lucile. He thoroughly cleaned and straightened the bureau drawers. He even rearranged the shelves of the kitchen downstairs and removed the gaily colored crêpe streamers from the electric fans. Then when this was done he sat in the tub and bathed himself all over. And the morning was done.,0
6104,Biff bit the thread and smoothed the black band on the sleeve of his coat. By now Lucile would be waiting for him. He and she and Baby would ride in the funeral car together. He put away the work basket and fitted the coat with the mourning band very carefully on his shoulders. He glanced swiftly around the room to see that all was well before going out again.,0
6105,"An hour later he was in Lucile's kitchenette. He sat with his legs crossed, a napkin over his thigh, drinking a cup of tea. Lucile and Alice had been so different in all ways that it was easy to realize they were sisters. Lucile was thin and dark, and today she had dressed completely in black. She was fixing Baby's hair. The little kid waited patiently on the kitchen table with her hands folded in her lap while her mother worked on her. The sunlight was quiet and mellow in the room.",0
6106,"'Bartholomew----' said Lucile.  'What?'  'Don't you ever start thinking backward?'  'I don't,' said Biff. 'You know it's like I got to wear blinders all the time so I won't think sideways or in the past. All I can let myself think about is going to work every day and fixing meals and Baby's future.'",0
6107,'That's the right attitude. ' 'I been giving Baby finger waves down at the shop. But they come out so quick I been thinking about letting her have a permanent. I don't want to give it to her myself--I think maybe I'll take her up to Atlanta when I go to the cosmetologist convention and let her get it there. ',0
6108,"'Motherogod! She's not but four. It's liable to scare her. And besides, permanents tend to coarsen the hair.'",0
6109,"Lucile dipped the comb in a glass of water and mashed the curls over Baby's ears. 'No, they don't. And she wants one. Young as Baby is, she already has as much ambition as I got. And that's saying plenty. '",0
6110,"Biff polished his nails on the palm of his hand and shook his head. 'Every time Baby and I go to the movies and see these kids in all the good rôles she feels the same way I do. I swear she does, Bartholomew. I can't even get her to eat her supper afterward. '",0
6111,"'For goodness' sake,' Biff said. 'She's getting along so fine with her dancing and expression lessons. Next year I want her to start with the piano because I think it'll be a help for her to play some. Her dancing teacher is going to give her a solo in the soirée. I feel like I got to push Baby all I can. Because the sooner she gets started on her career the better it'll be for both of us. '",0
6112,'Motherogod!'  'You don't understand. A child with talent can't be treated like ordinary kids. That's one reason I want to get Baby out of this common neighborhood. I can't let her start to talk vulgar like these brats around here or run wild like they do. ',0
6113,"'I know the kids on this block,' Biff said. 'They're all right. Those Kelly kids across the street--the Crane boy----'  'You know good and well that none of them are up to Baby's level.",0
6114,"' Lucile set the last wave in Baby's hair. She pinched the kid's little cheeks to put more color in them. Then she lifted her down from the table. For the funeral Baby had on a little white dress with white shoes and white socks and even small white gloves. There was a certain way Baby always held her head when people looked at her, and it was turned that way now.",0
6115,"They sat for a while in the small, hot kitchenette without saying anything. Then Lucile began to cry. 'It's not like we was ever very close as sisters. We had our differences and we didn't see much of each other. Maybe it was because I was so much younger. But there's something about your own blood kin, and when anything like this happens----'  Biff clucked soothingly.",0
6116,"'I know how you two were,' she said. 'It wasn't all just roses with you and she. But maybe that sort of makes it worse for you now. '",0
6117,"Biff caught Baby under the arms and swung her up to his shoulder. The kid was getting heavier. He held her carefully as he stepped into the living-room. Baby felt warm and close on his shoulder, and her little silk skirt was white against the dark cloth of his coat. She grasped one of his ears very tight with her little hand.",0
6118,"'Unca Biff! Watch me do the split.' Gently he set Baby on her feet again. She curved both arms above her head and her feet slid slowly in opposite directions on the yellow waxed floor. In a moment she was seated with one leg stretched straight in front of her and one behind. She posed with her arms held at a fancy angle, looking sideways at the wall with a sad expression.",0
6119,"She scrambled up again. 'Watch me do a handspring. Watch me do a----'  'Honey, be a little quieter,' Lucile said.",0
6120,"She sat down beside Biff on the plush sofa. 'Don't she remind you a little of him--something about her eyes and face?'  'Hell, no. I can't see the slightest resemblance between Baby and Leroy Wilson.'",0
6121,"Lucile looked too thin and worn-out for her age. Maybe it was the black dress and because she had been crying. 'After all, we got to admit he's Baby's father,' she said.",0
6122,'Can't you ever forget about that man?' 'I don't know. I guess I always been a fool about two things. And that's Leroy and Baby.',0
6123,"Biff's new growth of beard was blue against the pale skin of his face and his voice sounded tired. 'Don't you ever just think a thing through and find out what's happened and what ought to come from that? Don't you ever use logic--if these are the given facts this ought to be the result?'  'Not about him, I guess.",0
6124,"' Biff spoke in a weary manner and his eyes were almost closed. 'You married this certain party when you were seventeen, and afterward there was just one racket between you after another. You divorced him. Then two years later you married him a second time. And now he's gone off again and you don't know where he is. It seems like those facts would show you one thing--you two are not suited to each other. And that's aside from the more personal side--the sort of man this certain party happens to be anyway. '",0
6125,"'God knows I been realizing all along he's a heel. I just hope he won't ever knock on that door again. '  'Look, Baby,' Biff said quickly.",0
6126,He laced his fingers and held up his hands. 'This is the church and this is the steeple. Open the door and here are God's people.',0
6127,Lucile shook her head. 'You don't have to bother about Baby. I tell her everything. She knows about the whole mess from A to Z.'  'Then if he comes back you'll let him stay here and sponge on you just as long as he pleases--like it was before?,0
6128,"' 'Yeah. I guess I would. Every time the doorbell or the phone rings, every time anybody steps up on the porch, something in the back of my mind thinks about that man. '",0
6129,Biff spread out the palms of his hands. 'There you are. ',0
6130,The clock struck two. The room was very close and hot. Baby turned another handspring and made a split again on the waxed floor. Then Biff took her up into his lap. Her little legs dangled against his shin. She unbuttoned his vest and burrowed her face into him.,0
6131,"'Listen,' Lucile said. 'If I ask you a question will you promise to answer me the truth?'  'Sure.'  'No matter what it is?' Biff touched Baby's soft gold hair and laid his hand gently on the side of her little head. 'Of course.'  'It was about seven years ago.",0
6132,"Soon after we was married the first time. And he came in one night from your place with big knots all over his head and told me you caught him by the neck and banged his head against the side of the wall. He made up some tale about why you did it, but I want to know the real reason. '",0
6133,"Biff turned the wedding ring on his finger. 'I just never did like Leroy, and we had a fight. In those days I was different from now.'",0
6134,"'No. There was some definite thing you did that for. We been knowing each other a pretty long time, and I understand by now that you got a real reason for every single thing you ever do. Your mind runs by reasons instead of just wants. Now, you promised you'd tell me what it was, and I want to know.'",0
6135,'It wouldn't mean anything now. ' 'I tell you I got to know.',0
6136,"'All right,' Biff said. 'He came in that night and started drinking, and when he was drunk he shot off his mouth about you. He said he would come home about once a month and beat hell out of you and you would take it. But then afterward you would step outside in the hall and laugh aloud a few times so that the neighbors in the other rooms would think you both had just been playing around and it had all been a joke. That's what happened, so just forget about it. '",0
6137,"Lucile sat up straight and there was a red spot on each of her cheeks. 'You see, Bartholomew, that's why I got to be like I have blinders on all the time so as not to think backward or sideways. All I can let my mind stay on is going to work every day and fixing three meals here at home and Baby's career.'",0
6138,"'Yes.'  'I hope you'll do that too, and not start thinking backward. ' Biff leaned his head down on his chest and closed his eyes. During the whole long day he had not been able to think of Alice. When he tried to remember her face there was a queer blankness in him. The only thing about her that was clear in his mind was her feet--stumpy, very soft and white and with puffy little toes. The bottoms were pink and near the left heel there was a tiny brown mole. The night they were married he had taken off her shoes and stockings and kissed her feet. And, come to think of it, that was worth considering, because the Japanese believe that the choicest part of a woman----  Biff stirred and glanced at his watch.",0
6139,"In a little while they would leave for the church where the funeral would be held. In his mind he went through the motions of the ceremony. The church--riding dirge-paced behind the hearse with Lucile and Baby--the group of people standing with bowed heads in the October sunshine. Sun on the white tombstones, on the fading flowers and the canvas tent covering the newly dug grave. Then home again--and what?",0
6140,"'No matter how much you quarrel there's something about your own blood sister,' Lucile said. Biff raised his head. 'Why don't you marry again? Some nice young man who's never had a wife before, who would take care of you and Baby? If you'd just forget about Leroy you would make a good man a fine wife. '",0
6141,"Lucile was slow to answer. Then finally she said: 'You know how we always been--we nearly all the time understand each other pretty well without any kind of throbs either way. Well, that's the closest I ever want to be to any man again. '",0
6142,"'I feel the same way,' Biff said. Half an hour later there was a knock on the door. The car for the funeral was parked before the house. Biff and Lucile got up slowly. The three of them, with Baby in her white silk dress a little ahead, walked in solemn quietness outside.",0
6143,"Biff kept the restaurant closed during the next day. Then in the early evening he removed the faded wreath of lilies from the front door and opened the place for business again. Old customers came in with sad faces and talked with him a few minutes by the cash register before giving their orders. The usual crowd was present--Singer, Blount, various men who worked in stores along the block and in the mills down on the river. After supper Mick Kelly showed up with her little brother and put a nickel into the slot machine. When she lost the first coin she banged on the machine with her fists and kept opening the receiver to be sure that nothing had come down. Then she put in another nickel and almost won the jackpot. Coins came clattering out and rolled along the floor. The kid and her little brother both kept looking around pretty sharp as they picked them up, so that no customer would put his foot on one before they could get to it. The mute was at the table in the middle of the room with his dinner before him. Across from him Jake Blount sat drinking beer, dressed in his Sunday clothes, and talking. Everything was the same as it had always been before. After a while the air became gray with cigarette smoke and the noise increased. Biff was alert, and no sound or movement escaped him.",0
6144,"'I go around,' Blount said. He leaned earnestly across the table and kept his eyes on the mute's face. 'I go all around and try to tell them. And they laugh. I can't make them understand anything. No matter what I say I can't seem to make them see the truth.'",0
6145,"Singer nodded and wiped his mouth with his napkin. His dinner had got cold because he couldn't look down to eat, but he was so polite that he let Blount go on talking. The words of the two children at the slot machine were high and clear against the coarser voices of the men. Mick was putting her nickels back into the slot. Often she looked around at the middle table, but the mute had his back turned to her and did not see.",0
6146,"'Mister Singer's got fried chicken for his supper and he hasn't eat one piece yet,' the little boy said. Mick pulled down the lever of the machine very slowly. 'Mind your own business. '",0
6147,"'You're always going up to his room or some place where you know he'll be.' 'I told you to hush, Bubber Kelly.' 'You do.'",0
6148,"Mick shook him until his teeth rattled and turned him around toward the door. 'You go on home to bed. I already told you I get a bellyful of you and Ralph in the daytime, and I don't want you hanging around me at night when I'm supposed to be free. '",0
6149,"Bubber held out his grimy little hand. 'Well, give me a nickel, then.' When he had put the money in his shirt pocket he left for home.",0
6150,"Biff straightened his coat and smoothed back his hair. His tie was solid black, and on the sleeve of his gray coat there was the mourning band that he had sewn there. He wanted to go up to the slot machine and talk with Mick, but something would not let him. He sucked in his breath sharply and drank a glass of water. A dance orchestra came in on the radio, but he did not want to listen. All the tunes in the last ten years were so alike he couldn't tell one from the other. Since 1928 he had not enjoyed music. Yet when he was young he used to play the mandolin, and he knew the words and the melody of every current song.",0
6151,"He laid his finger on the side of his nose and cocked his head to one side. Mick had grown so much in the past year that soon she would be taller than he was. She was dressed in the red sweater and blue pleated skirt she had worn every day since school started. Now the pleats had come out and the hem dragged loose around her sharp, jutting knees. She was at the age when she looked as much like an overgrown boy as a girl. And on that subject why was it that the smartest people mostly missed that point? By nature all people are of both sexes. So that marriage and the bed is not all by any means. The proof? Real youth and old age. Because often old men's voices grow high and reedy and they take on a mincing walk. And old women sometimes grow fat and their voices get rough and deep and they grow dark little mustaches. And he even proved it himself--the part of him that sometimes almost wished he was a mother and that Mick and Baby were his kids. Abruptly Biff turned from the cash register.",0
6152,"The newspapers were in a mess. For two weeks he hadn't filed a single one. He lifted a stack of them from under the counter. With a practiced eye he glanced from the masthead to the bottom of the sheet. Tomorrow he would look over the stacks of them in the back room and see about changing the system of files. Build shelves and use those solid boxes canned goods were shipped in for drawers. Chronologically from October 27, 1918, on up to the present date. With folders and top markings outlining historical events. Three sets of outlines--one international beginning with the Armistice and leading through the Munich aftermath, the second national, the third all the local dope from the time Mayor Lester shot his wife at the country club up to the Hudson Mill fire. Everything for the past twenty years docketed and outlined and complete. Biff beamed quietly behind his hand as he rubbed his jaw. And yet Alice had wanted him to haul out the papers so she could turn the room into a ladies' toilet. That was just what she had nagged him to do, but for once he had battered her down. For that one time.",0
6153,"With peaceful absorption Biff settled down to the details of the newspaper before him. He read steadily and with concentration, but from habit some secondary part of him was alert to everything around him. Jake Blount was still talking, and often he would hit his fist on the table. The mute sipped beer. Mick walked restlessly around the radio and stared at the customers. Biff read every word in the first paper and made a few notes on the margins.",0
6154,"Then suddenly he looked up with a surprised expression. His mouth had been open for a yawn and he snapped it shut. The radio swung into an old song that dated back to the time when he and Alice were engaged. 'Just a Baby's Prayer at Twilight.' They had taken the streetcar one Sunday to Old Sardis Lake and had rented a rowboat. At sunset he played on the mandolin while she sang. She had on a sailor hat, and when he put his arm around her waist she--Alice----  A dragnet for lost feelings.",0
6155,"Biff folded the newspapers and put them back under the counter. He stood on one foot and then the other. Finally he called across the room to Mick. 'You're not listening, are you?'",0
6156,Mick turned off the radio. ' No. Nothing on tonight. ',0
6157,"All of that he would keep out of his mind, and concentrate on something else. He leaned over the counter and watched one customer after another. Then at last his attention rested on the mute at the middle table. He saw Mick edge gradually up to him and at his invitation sit down. Singer pointed to something on the menu and the waitress brought a Coca-Cola for her. Nobody but a freak like a deaf-mute, cut off from other people, would ask a right young girl to sit down to the table where he was drinking with another man. Blount and Mick both kept their eyes on Singer. They talked, and the mute's expression changed as he watched them. It was a funny thing. The reason--was it in them or in him? He sat very still with his hands in his pockets, and because he did not speak it made him seem superior. What did that fellow think and realize? What did he know?",0
6158,"Twice during the evening Biff started to go over to the middle table, but each time he checked himself. After they were gone he still wondered what it was about this mute--and in the early dawn when he lay in bed he turned over questions and solutions in his mind without satisfaction. The puzzle had taken root in him. It worried him in the back of his mind and left him uneasy. There was something wrong.",0
6159,"[3] Many times Doctor Copeland talked to Mr. Singer. Truly he was not like other white men. He was a wise man, and he understood the strong, true purpose in a way that other white men could not. He listened, and in his face there was something gentle and Jewish, the knowledge of one who belongs to a race that is oppressed. On one occasion he took Mr. Singer with him on his rounds. He led him through cold, narrow passages smelling of dirt and sickness and fried fatback. He showed him a successful skin graft made on the face of a woman patient who had been severely burned. He treated a syphilitic child and pointed out to Mr. Singer the scaling eruption on the palms of the hand, the dull, opaque surface of the eye, the sloping upper front incisors. They visited two-room shacks that house as many as twelve or fourteen persons. In a room where the fire burned low and orange on the hearth they were helpless while an old man strangled with pneumonia. Mr. Singer walked behind him and watched and understood. He gave nickels to the children, and because of his quietness and decorum he did not disturb the patients as would have another visitor.",0
6160,"The days were chilly and treacherous. In the town there was an outbreak of influenza so that Doctor Copeland was busy most of the hours of the day and night. He drove through the Negro sections of the town in the high Dodge automobile he had used for the past nine years. He kept the isinglass curtains snapped to the windows to cut off the draughts, and tight around his neck he wore his gray wool shawl. During this time he did not see Portia or William or Highboy, but often he thought of them. Once when he was away Portia came to see him and left a note and borrowed half a sack of meal.",0
6161,"There came a night when he was so exhausted that, although there were other calls to make, he drank hot milk and went to bed. He was cold and feverish so that at first he could not rest. Then it seemed that he had only begun to sleep when a voice called him. He got up wearily and, still in his long flannel nightshirt, he opened the front door. It was Portia.",0
6162,"'The Lord Jesus help us, Father,' she said. Doctor Copeland stood shivering with his nightshirt drawn close around his waist. He held his hand to his throat and looked at her and waited.",0
6163,'It about our Willie. He been a bad boy and done got hisself in mighty bad trouble. And us got to do something. '  Doctor Copeland walked from the hall with rigid steps.,0
6164,"He stopped in the bedroom for his bathrobe, shawl, and slippers and went back to the kitchen. Portia was waiting for him there. The kitchen was lifeless and cold.",0
6165,'All right. What has he done? What is it?'  'Just wait a minute.,0
6166,"Just let me find brain room so I can study it all out and tell it to you plain.' He crushed some sheets of newspaper lying on the hearth and picked up a few sticks of kindling. 'Let me make the fire,' Portia said. 'You just sit down at the table, and soon as this here stove is hot us going to have a cup of coffee. Then maybe it all won't seem so bad. '",0
6167,'There is not any coffee. I used the last of it yesterday. ',0
6168,"When he said this Portia began to cry. Savagely she stuffed paper and wood into the stove and lighted it with a trembling hand. 'This here the way it is,' she said. 'Willie and Highboy were messing around tonight at a place where they got no business being. You know how I feels like I always got to keep my Willie and my Highboy close to me? Well, if I'd been there none of this trouble would of come about. But I were at the Ladies' Meeting at the church and them boys got restless. They went down to Madame Reba's Palace of Sweet Pleasure. And Father, that is sure one bad, wicked place. They got a man sells tickets on the bug--but they also got these strutting, bad-blood, tail-shaking nigger gals and these here red satin curtains and----'  'Daughter,' said Doctor Copeland irritably.",0
6169,He pressed his hands to the sides of his head. 'I know the place. Get to the point. '  'Love Jones were there--and she is one bad colored gal.,0
6170,"Willie he drunk liquor and shimmied around with her until first thing you know he were in a fight. He were in a fight with this boy named Junebug--over Love. And for a while they fights there with their hands and then this Junebug got out his knife. Our Willie didn't have no knife, so he commenced to bellow and run around the parlor. Then finally Highboy found Willie a razor and he backed up and nearbout cut this Junebug's head off. '  Doctor Copeland drew his shawl closer around him.",0
6171,"'Is he dead?'  'That boy too mean to die. He in the hospital, but he going to be out and making trouble again before long.'  'And William?'  'The police come in and taken him to the jail in the Black Maria. He still locked up.'",0
6172,"'And he did not get hurt?' 'Oh, he got a busted eye and a little chunk cut out his behind. But it won't bother him none. What I can't understand is how come he would be messing around with that Love. She at least ten shades blacker than I is and she the ugliest nigger I ever seen. She walk like she have a egg between her legs and don't want to break it. She ain't even clean. And here Willie done cut the buck like this over her. '  Doctor Copeland leaned close to the stove and groaned.",0
6173,He coughed and his face stiffened. He held his paper handkerchief to his mouth and it became spotted with blood. The dark skin of his face took on a greenish pallor.,0
6174,"'Course Highboy come and tell me soon as it all happened. Understand, my Highboy didn't have nothing to do with these here bad gals. He were just keeping Willie company. He so grieved about Willie he been sitting out on the street curb front of the jail ever since.' The fire-colored tears rolled down Portia's face. 'You know how us three has always been. Us haves our own plan and nothing ever went wrong with it before. Even money hasn't bothered us none. Highboy he pay the rent and I buys the food and Willie he takes care Saturday Night. Us has always been like three-piece twinses.'",0
6175,At last it was morning. The mill whistles blew for the first shift. The sun came out and brightened the clean saucepans hanging on the wall above the stove. They sat for a long time. Portia pulled at the rings on her ears until her lobes were irritated and purplish red. Doctor Copeland still held his head in his hands.,0
6176,"'Seem to me,' Portia said finally, 'if us can just get a lot of white peoples to write letters about Willie it might help out some. I already been to see Mr. Brannon. He written exactly what I told him to. He were at his café after it all happened like he is ever night. So I just went in there and explained how it was. I taken the letter home with me. I done put it in the Bible so I won't lose it or dirty it. '",0
6177,'What did the letter say?'  'Mr. Brannon he wrote just like I asked him to. The letter tell about how Willie has been working for Mr. Brannon going on three year. It tell how Willie is one fine upstanding colored boy and how he hasn't ever been in no trouble before now. It tell how he always had plenty chances to take things in the café if he were like some other type of colored boy and how----'  'Pshaw!' said Doctor Copeland.,0
6178,' All that is no good. ',0
6179,"'Us just can't sit around and wait. With Willie locked up in the jail. My Willie, who is such a sweet boy even if he did do wrong tonight. Us just can't sit around and wait.'",0
6180,"'We will have to. That is the only thing we can do.' 'Well, I know I ain't. '",0
6181,Portia got up from the chair. Her eyes roved distractedly around the room as though searching for something. Then abruptly she went toward the front door.,0
6182,"'Wait a minute,' said Doctor Copeland. 'Where do you intend to go now?'  'I got to work. I sure got to keep my job. I sure have to stay on with Mrs. Kelly and get my pay ever week. '",0
6183,"'I want to go to the jail,' said Doctor Copeland. 'Maybe I can see William.' 'I going to drop by the jail on my way to work. I got to send Highboy off to his work, too--else he liable to sit there grieving about Willie all the morning. '  Doctor Copeland dressed hurriedly and joined Portia in the hall.",0
6184,"They went out into the cool, blue autumn morning. The men at the jail were rude to them and they were able to find out very little. Doctor Copeland then went to consult a lawyer with whom he had had dealings before. The following days were long and full of worried thoughts. At the end of three weeks the trial for William was held and he was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon. He was sentenced to nine months of hard labor and sent immediately to a prison in the northern part of the state.",0
6185,"* * * * *  Even now the strong true purpose was always in him, but he had no time in which to think on it. He went from one house to another and the work was unending. Very early in the morning he drove off in the automobile, and then at eleven o'clock the patients came to the office. After the sharp autumn air outside there would be a hot, stale odor in the house that made him cough. The benches in the hall were always full of sick and patient Negroes who waited for him, and sometimes even the front porch and his bedroom would be crowded. All the day and frequently half the night there was work. Because of the tiredness in him he wanted sometimes to lie down on the floor and beat with his fists and cry. If he could rest he might get well. He had tuberculosis of the lungs, and he measured his temperature four times a day and had an X-ray once a month. But he could not rest. For there was another thing bigger than the tiredness--and this was the strong true purpose.",0
6186,"He would think of this purpose until sometimes, after a long day and night of work, he would become blank so that he would forget for a minute just what the purpose was. And then it would come to him again and he would be restless and eager to take on a new task. But the words often stuck in his mouth, and his voice now was hoarse and not loud as it had been before. He pushed the words into the sick and patient faces of the Negroes who were his people.",0
6187,Often he talked to Mr. Singer. With him he spoke of chemistry and the enigma of the universe. Of the infinitesimal sperm and the cleavage of the ripened egg. Of the complex million-fold division of the cells. Of the mystery of living matter and the simplicity of death. And also he spoke with him of race.,0
6188,"'My people were brought from the great plains, and the dark, green jungles,' he said once to Mr. Singer. ' On the long chained journeys to the coast they died by the thousands. Only the strong survived. Chained in the foul ships that brought them here they died again. Only the hardy Negroes with will could live. Beaten and chained and sold on the block, the least of these strong ones perished again. And finally through the bitter years the strongest of my people are still here. Their sons and daughters, their grandsons and great grandsons. '",0
6189,"* * * * *  'I come to borrow and I come to ask a favor,' Portia said.",0
6190,"Doctor Copeland was alone in his kitchen when she walked through the hall and stood in the doorway to tell him this. Two weeks had passed since William had been sent away. Portia was changed. Her hair was not oiled and combed as usual, her eyes were bloodshot as though she had partaken of strong drink. Her cheeks were hollow, and with her sorrowful, honey-colored face she truly resembled her mother now.",0
6191,"'You know them nice white plates and cups you have?'  'You may have them and keep them. ' 'No, I only wants to borrow. And also I come here to ask a favor of you.'",0
6192,"'Anything you wish,' said Doctor Copeland. Portia sat down across the table from her father. ' First I suppose I better explain. Yesdiddy I got this here message from Grandpapa saying they all are coming in tomorrow and spend the night and part of Sunday with us. Course they been mighty worried about Willie, and Grandpapa feel like us all ought to get together again. He right, too. I sure do want to see our kinfolks again. I been mighty homesick since Willie been gone.'",0
6193,"'You may have the plates and anything else you can find around here,' Doctor Copeland said. 'But hold up your shoulders, Daughter. Your carriage is bad. '",0
6194,'It going to be a real reunion. You know this the first time Grandpapa have spent the night in town for twenty years. He haven't ever slept outside of his own home except two times in his whole life. And anyway he kind of nervous at night. All during the dark he have to get up and drink water and be sure the childrens is covered up all right. I a little worried about if Grandpapa will be comfortable here. ',0
6195,"'Anything of mine you think you will need----'  'Course Lee Jackson bringing them in,' said Portia. ' And with Lee Jackson it going to take them all day to get here. I not expecting them till around supper-time. Course Grandpapa always so patient with Lee Jackson he wouldn't make him hurry none.'",0
6196,'My soul! Is that old mule still alive? He must be fully eighteen years old. ',0
6197,'He even older than that. Grandpapa been working him now for twenty years. He done had that mule so long he always say it just like Lee Jackson is one of his blood kin. He understand and love Lee Jackson like he do his own grandchildrens. I never seen a human who know so good what a animal is thinking as Grandpapa. He haves a close feeling for everthing that walks and eats.',0
6198,"'Twenty years is a long time to work a mule. ' 'It sure is. Now Lee Jackson is right feeble. But Grandpapa sure do take good care of him. When they plows out in the hot sun Lee Jackson haves a great big straw hat on his head just like Grandpapa--with holes cut for his ears. That mule's straw hat is a real joke, and Lee Jackson won't budge a step when he going to plow without that hat is on his head. '",0
6199,"Doctor Copeland took down the white china dishes from the shelf and began to wrap them in newspaper. 'Have you enough pots and pans to cook all the food you will need?'  'Plenty,' Portia said. 'I not going to any special trouble. Grandpapa, he Mr. Thoughtful hisself--and he always bring in something to help out when the fambly come to dinner. I only going to have plenty meal and cabbage and two pounds of nice mullet.'  'Sounds good.",0
6200,' Portia laced her nervous yellow fingers together. ' There one thing I haven't told you yet. A surprise. Buddy going to be here as well as Hamilton. Buddy just come back from Mobile. He helping out on the farm now. ',0
6201,"'It has been five years since I last saw Karl Marx.' 'And that just what I come to ask you about,' said Portia. 'You remember when I walked in the door I told you I come to borrow and to ask a favor. '",0
6202,"Doctor Copeland cracked the joints of his fingers. 'Yes.'  'Well, I come to see if I can't get you to be there tomorrow at the reunion. All your childrens but Willie going to be there. Seem to me like you ought to join us. I sure will be glad if you come.'",0
6203,"Hamilton and Karl Marx and Portia--and William. Doctor Copeland removed his spectacles and pressed his fingers against his eyelids. For a minute he saw the four of them very plainly as they were a long time ago. Then he looked up and straightened his glasses on his nose. 'Thank you,' he said. 'I will come.'",0
6204,"That night he sat alone by the stove in the dark room and remembered. He thought back to the time of his childhood. His mother had been born a slave, and after freedom she was a washerwoman. His father was a preacher who had once known John Brown. They had taught him, and out of the two or three dollars they had earned each week they saved. When he was seventeen years old they had sent him North with eighty dollars hidden in his shoe. He had worked in a blacksmith's shop and as a waiter and as a bellboy in a hotel. And all the while he studied and read and went to school. His father died and his mother did not live long without him. And after ten years of struggle he was a doctor and he knew his mission and he came South again.",0
6205,"He married and made a home. He went endlessly from house to house and spoke the mission and the truth. The hopeless suffering of his people made in him a madness, a wild and evil feeling of destruction. At times he drank strong liquor and beat his head against the floor. In his heart there was a savage violence, and once he grasped the poker from the hearth and struck down his wife. She took Hamilton, Karl Marx, William, and Portia with her to her father's home. He wrestled in his spirit and fought down the evil blackness. But Daisy did not come back to him. And eight years later when she died his sons were not children any more and they did not return to him. He was left an old man in an empty house.",0
6206,"* * * * *  Promptly at five o'clock the next afternoon he arrived at the house where Portia and Highboy lived. They resided in the part of town called Sugar Hill, and the house was a narrow cottage with a porch and two rooms. From inside there was a babble of mixed voices. Doctor Copeland approached stiffly and stood in the doorway holding his shabby felt hat in his hand.",0
6207,The room was crowded and at first he was not noticed. He sought the faces of Karl Marx and Hamilton. Besides them there was Grandpapa and two children who sat together on the floor. He was still looking into the faces of his sons when Portia perceived him standing in the door.,0
6208,"'Here Father,' she said. The voices stopped. Grandpapa turned around in his chair. He was thin and bent and very wrinkled. He was wearing the same greenish-black suit that he had worn thirty years before at his daughter's wedding. Across his vest there was a tarnished brass watch chain. Karl Marx and Hamilton looked at each other, then down at the floor, and finally at their father.",0
6209,"'Benedict Mady----' said the old man. 'Been a long time. A real long time. '  'Ain't it, though!'",0
6210,"Portia said. ' This here the first reunion us is all had in many a year. Highboy, you get a chair from the kitchen. Father, here Buddy and Hamilton. '",0
6211,"Doctor Copeland shook hands with his sons. They were both tall and strong and awkward. Against their blue shirts and overalls their skin had the same rich brown color as did Portia's. They did not look him in the eye, and in their faces there was neither love nor hate.",0
6212,"'It sure is a pity everbody couldn't come--Aunt Sara and Jim and all the rest,' said Highboy. ' But this here is a real pleasure to us. '  'Wagon too full,' said one of the children.",0
6213,'Us had to walk a long piece 'cause the wagon too full anyways. ' Grandpapa scratched his ear with a matchstick. 'Somebody got to stay home. ',0
6214,"Nervously Portia licked her dark, thin lips. 'It our Willie I thinking about. He were always a big one for any kind of party or to-do. My mind just won't stay off our Willie. '",0
6215,"Through the room there was a quiet murmur of agreement. The old man leaned back in his chair and waggled his head up and down. 'Portia, Hon, supposing you reads to us a little while. The word of God sure do mean a lot in a time of trouble. '",0
6216,"Portia took up the Bible from the table in the center of the room. ' What part you want to hear now, Grandpapa?'",0
6217,"'It all the book of the Holy Lord. Just any place your eye fall on will do.' Portia read from the Book of Luke. She read slowly, tracing the words with her long, limp finger. The room was still. Doctor Copeland sat on the edge of the group, cracking his knuckles, his eyes wandering from one point to another. The room was very small, the air close and stuffy. The four walls were cluttered with calendars and crudely painted advertisements from magazines. On the mantel there was a vase of red paper roses. The fire on the hearth burned slowly and the wavering light from the oil lamp made shadows on the wall. Portia read with such slow rhythm that the words slept in Doctor Copeland's ears and he was drowsy. Karl Marx lay sprawled upon the floor beside the children. Hamilton and Highboy dozed. Only the old man seemed to study the meaning of the words.",0
6218,"Portia finished the chapter and closed the book. 'I done pondered over this thing a many a time,' said Grandpapa. The people in the room came out of their drowsiness. 'What?' asked Portia.",0
6219,"'It this way. You recall them parts about Jesus raising the dead and curing the sick?' 'Course we does, sir,' said Highboy deferentially.",0
6220,"'Many a day when I be plowing or working,' Grandpapa said slowly, 'I done thought and reasoned about the time when Jesus going to descend again to this earth. 'Cause I done always wanted it so much it seem to me like it will be while I am living. I done studied about it many a time. And this here the way I done planned it. I reason I will get to stand before Jesus with all my childrens and grandchildrens and great grandchildrens and kinfolks and friends an I say to Him, ""Jesus Christ, us is all sad colored peoples. And then he will place His holy hand upon our heads and straightway us will be white as cotton. That the plan and reasoning that been in my heart a many and a many a time. '",0
6221,A hush fell on the room. Doctor Copeland jerked the cuffs of his sleeves and cleared his throat. His pulse beat too fast and his throat was tight. Sitting in the corner of the room he felt isolated and angry and alone.,0
6222,"'Has any of you ever had a sign from Heaven?' asked Grandpapa. 'I has, sir,' said Highboy. 'Once when I were sick with the pneumonia I seen God's face looking out the fireplace at me. It were a large white man's face with a white beard and blue eyes. '",0
6223,"'I seen a ghost,' said one of the children--the girl. 'Once I seen----' began the little boy. Grandpapa held up his hand. 'You childrens hush. You, Celia--and you, Whitman--it now the time for you to listen but not be heard,' he said. 'Only one time has I had a real sign. And this here the way it come about. It were in the summer of last year, and hot. I were trying to dig up the roots of that big oak stump near the hog-pen and when I leaned down a kind of catch, a misery, come suddenly in the small of my back. I straightened up and then all around went dark. I were holding my hand to my back and looking up at the sky when suddenly I seen this little angel. It were a little white girl angel--look to me about the size of a field pea--with yellow hair and a white robe. Just flying around near the sun. After that I come in the house and prayed. I studied the Bible for three days before I went out in the field again. '",0
6224,"Doctor Copeland felt the old evil anger in him. The words rose inchoately to his throat and he could not speak them. They would listen to the old man. Yet to words of reason they would not attend. These are my people, he tried to tell himself--but because he was dumb this thought did not help him now. He sat tense and sullen.",0
6225,"'It a queer thing,' said Grandpapa suddenly. 'Benedict Mady, you a fine doctor. How come I get them miseries sometime in the small of my back after I been digging and planting for a good while? How come that misery bother me?'  'How old are you now?'",0
6226,'I somewhere between seventy and eighty year old. ' The old man loved medicine and treatment. Always when he used to come in with his family to see Daisy he would have himself examined and take home medicine and salves for the whole group of them. But when Daisy left him the old man did not come anymore and he had to content himself with purges and kidney pills advertised in the newspapers. Now the old man was looking at him with timid eagerness.,0
6227,"'Drink plenty of water,' said Doctor Copeland. ' And rest as much as you can.'",0
6228,"Portia went into the kitchen to prepare the supper. Warm smells began to fill the room. There was quiet, idle talking, but Doctor Copeland did not listen or speak. Now and then he looked at Karl Marx or Hamilton. Karl Marx talked about Joe Louis. Hamilton spoke mostly of the hail that had ruined some of the crops. When they caught their father's eye they grinned and shuffled their feet on the floor. He kept staring at them with angry misery.",0
6229,"Doctor Copeland clamped his teeth down hard. He had thought so much about Hamilton and Karl Marx and William and Portia, about the real true purpose he had had for them, that the sight of their faces made a black swollen feeling in him. If once he could tell it all to them, from the far away beginning until this very night, the telling would ease the sharp ache in his heart. But they would not listen or understand.",0
6230,"He hardened himself so that each muscle in his body was rigid and strained. He did not listen or look at anything around him. He sat in a corner like a man who is blind and dumb. Soon they went into the supper table and the old man said grace. But Doctor Copeland did not eat. When Highboy brought out a pint bottle of gin, and they laughed and passed the bottle from mouth to mouth, he refused that also. He sat in rigid silence, and at last he picked up his hat and left the house without a farewell. If he could not speak the whole long truth no other word would come to him.",0
6231,"* * * * *  He lay tense and wakeful throughout the night. Then the next day was Sunday. He made half a dozen calls, and in the middle of the morning he went to Mr. Singer's room. The visit blunted the feeling of loneliness in him so that when he said good-bye he was at peace with himself once more.",0
6232,"However, before he was out of the house this peace had left him. An accident occurred. As he started down the stairs he saw a white man carrying a large paper sack and he drew close to the banisters so that they could pass each other. But the white man was running up the steps two at a time, without looking, and they collided with such force that Doctor Copeland was left sick and breathless.",0
6233,'Christ! I didn't see you. ',0
6234,"Doctor Copeland looked at him closely but made no answer. He had seen this white man once before. He remembered the stunted, brutal-looking body and the huge, awkward hands. Then with sudden clinical interest he observed the white man's face, for in his eyes he saw a strange, fixed, and withdrawn look of madness.",0
6235,"'Sorry,' said the white man. Doctor Copeland put his hand on the banister and passed on. [4] 'Who was that?' Jake Blount asked. 'Who was the tall, thin colored man that just come out of here? '",0
6236,"The small room was very neat. The sun lighted a bowl of purple grapes on the table. Singer sat with his chair tilted back and his hands in his pockets, looking out of the window.",0
6237,"'I bumped into him on the steps and he gave me this look--why, I never had anybody to look at me so dirty. ' Jake put the sack of ales down on the table. He realized with a shock that Singer did not know he was in the room. He walked over to the window and touched Singer on the shoulder.",0
6238,'I didn't mean to bump into him. He had no cause to act like that. ',0
6239,Jake shivered. Although the sun was bright there was a chill in the room. Singer held up his forefinger and went into the hall. When he returned he brought with him a scuttle of coal and some kindling. Jake watched him kneel before the hearth. Neatly he broke the sticks of kindling over his knee and arranged them on the foundation of paper. He put the coal on according to a system. At first the fire would not draw. The flames quivered weakly and were smothered by a black roll of smoke. Singer covered the grate with a double sheet of newspaper. The draught gave the fire new life. In the room there was a roaring sound. The paper glowed and was sucked inward. A crackling orange sheet of flame filled the grate.,0
6240,"The first morning ale had a fine mellow taste. Jake gulped his share down quickly and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. 'There was this lady I knew a long time ago,' he said. 'You sort of remind me of her. Miss Clara. She had a little farm in Texas. And made pralines to sell in the cities. She was a tall, big, fine-looking lady. Wore those long, baggy sweaters and clodhopper shoes and a man's hat. Her husband was dead when I knew her. But what I'm getting at is this: If it hadn't been for her I might never have known. I might have gone on through life like the millions of others who don't know. I would have just been a preacher or a linthead or a salesman. My whole life might have been wasted. '",0
6241,"Jake shook his head wonderingly. 'To understand you got to know what went before. You see, I lived in Gastonia when I was a youngun. I was a knock-kneed little runt, too small to put in the mill. I worked as pin boy in a bowling joint and got meals for pay. Then I heard a smart, quick boy could make thirty cents a day stringing tobacco not very far from there. So I went and made that thirty cents a day. That was when I was ten years old. I just left my folks. I didn't write. They were glad I was gone. You understand how those things are. And besides, nobody could read a letter but my sister.'",0
6242,He waved his hand in the air as though brushing something from his face. ' But I mean this. My first belief was Jesus. There was this fellow working in the same shed with me. He had a tabernacle and preached every night. I went and listened and I got this faith. My mind was on Jesus all day long. In my spare time I studied the Bible and prayed. Then one night I took a hammer and laid my hand on the table. I was angry and I drove the nail all the way through. My hand was nailed to the table and I looked at it and the fingers fluttered and turned blue.',0
6243,"Jake held out his palm and pointed to the ragged, dead-white scar in the center. 'I wanted to be an evangelist. I meant to travel around the country preaching and holding revivals. In the meantime I moved around from one place to another, and when I was nearly twenty I got to Texas. I worked in a pecan grove near where Miss Clara lived. I got to know her and at night sometimes I would go to her house. She talked to me. Understand, I didn't begin to know all at once. That's not the way it happens to any of us. It was gradual. I began to read. I would work just so I could put aside enough money to knock off for a while and study. It was like being born a second time. Just us who know can understand what it means. We have opened our eyes and have seen. We're like people from way off yonder somewhere. '",0
6244,Singer agreed with him. The room was comfortable in a homey way. Singer brought out from the closet the tin box in which he kept crackers and fruit and cheese. He selected an orange and peeled it slowly. He pulled off shreds of pith until the fruit was transparent in the sun. He sectioned the orange and divided the plugs between them. Jake ate two sections at a time and with a loud whoosh spat the seeds into the fire. Singer ate his share slowly and deposited his seeds neatly in the palm of one hand. They opened two more ales.,0
6245,'And how many of us are there in this country? Maybe ten thousand. Maybe twenty thousand. Maybe a lot more. I been to a lot of places but I never met but a few of us. But say a man does know. He sees the world as it is and he looks back thousands of years to see how it all come about. He watches the slow agglutination of capital and power and he sees its pinnacle today. He sees America as a crazy house. He sees how men have to rob their brothers in order to live. He sees children starving and women working sixty hours a week to get to eat. He sees a whole damn army of unemployed and billions of dollars and thousands of miles of land wasted. He sees war coming. He sees how when people suffer just so much they get mean and ugly and something dies in them. But the main thing he sees is that the whole system of the world is built on a lie. And although it's as plain as the shining sun--the don't-knows have lived with that lie so long they just can't see it. ',0
6246,"The red corded vein in Jake's forehead swelled angrily. He grasped the scuttle on the hearth and rattled an avalanche of coal on the fire. His foot had gone to sleep, and he stamped it so hard that the floor shook.",0
6247,'I been all over this place. I walk around. I talk. I try to explain to them. But what good does it do? Lord God!',0
6248,"He gazed into the fire, and a flush from the ale and heat deepened the color of his face. The sleepy tingling in his foot spread up his leg. He drowsed and saw the colors of the fire, the tints of green and blue and burning yellow. 'You're the only one,' he said dreamily. 'The only one.'",0
6249,"He was a stranger no longer. By now he knew every street, every alley, every fence in all the sprawling slums of the town. He still worked at the Sunny Dixie. During the fall the show moved from one vacant lot to another, staying always within the fringes of the city limit, until at last it had encircled the town. The locations were changed but the settings were alike--a strip of wasteland bordered by rows of rotted shacks, and somewhere near a mill, a cotton gin, or a bottling plant. The crowd was the same, for the most part factory workers and Negroes. The show was gaudy with colored lights in the evening. The wooden horses of the flying-jinny revolved in the circle to the mechanical music. The swings whirled, the rail around the penny throwing game was always crowded. From the two booths were sold drinks and bloody brown hamburgers and cotton candy.",0
6250,"He had been hired as a machinist, but gradually the range of his duties widened. His coarse, bawling voice called out through the noise, and continually he was lounging from one place on the show grounds to another. Sweat stood out on his forehead and often his mustache was soaked with beer. On Saturday his job was to keep the people in order. His squat, hard body pushed through the crowd with savage energy. Only his eyes did not share the violence of the rest of him. Wide gazing beneath his massive scowling forehead, they had a withdrawn and distracted appearance.",0
6251,"He reached home between twelve and one in the morning. The house where he lived was squared into four rooms and the rent was a dollar fifty per person. There was a privy in the back and a hydrant on the stoop. In his room the walls and floor had a wet, sour smell. Sooty, cheap lace curtains hung at the window. He kept his good suit in his bag and hung his overalls on a nail. The room had no heat and no electricity. However, a street light shone outside the window and made a pale greenish reflection inside. He never lighted the oil lamp by his bed unless he wanted to read. The acrid smell of burning oil in the cold room nauseated him.",0
6252,"If he stayed at home he restlessly walked the floor. He sat on the edge of the unmade bed and gnawed savagely at the broken, dirty ends of his fingernails. The sharp taste of grime lingered in his mouth. The loneliness in him was so keen that he was filled with terror. Usually he had a pint of bootleg white lightning. He drank the raw liquor and by daylight he was warm and relaxed. At five o'clock the whistles from the mills blew for the first shift. The whistles made lost, eerie echoes, and he could never sleep until after they had sounded.",0
6253,"But usually he did not stay at home. He went out into the narrow, empty streets. In the first dark hours of the morning the sky was black and the stars hard and bright. Sometimes the mills were running. From the yellow-lighted buildings came the racket of the machines. He waited at the gates for the early shift. Young girls in sweaters and print dresses came out into the dark street. The men came out carrying their dinner pails. Some of them always went to a streetcar café for Coca-Cola or coffee before going home, and Jake went with them. Inside the noisy mill the men could hear plainly every word that was spoken, but for the first hour outside they were deaf.",0
6254,"In the streetcar Jake drank Coca-Cola with whiskey added. He talked. The winter dawn was white and smoky and cold. He looked with drunken urgency into the drawn, yellow faces of the men. Often he was laughed at, and when this happened he held his stunted body very straight and spoke scornfully in words of many syllables. He stuck his little finger out from his glass and haughtily twisted his mustache. And if he was still laughed at he sometimes fought. He swung his big brown fists with crazed violence and sobbed aloud.",0
6255,"After such mornings he returned to the show with relief. It eased him to push through the crowds of people. The noise, the rank stinks, the shouldering contact of human flesh soothed his jangled nerves.",0
6256,"Because of the blue laws in the town the show closed for the Sabbath. On Sunday he got up early in the morning and took from the suitcase his serge suit. He went to the main street. First he dropped into the New York Café and bought a sack of ales. Then he went to Singer's room. Although he knew many people in the town by name or face, the mute was his only friend. They would idle in the quiet room and drink the ales. He would talk, and the words created themselves from the dark mornings spent in the streets or in his room alone. The words were formed and spoken with relief.",0
6257,"* * * * *  The fire had died down. Singer was playing a game of fools with himself at the table. Jake had been asleep. He awoke with a nervous quiver. He raised his head and turned to Singer. ' Yeah,' he said as though in answer to a sudden question. 'Some of us are Communists. But not all of us----. Myself, I'm not a member of the Communist Party. Because in the first place I never knew but one of them. You can bum around for years and not meet Communists. Around here there's no office where you can go up and say you want to join--and if there is I never heard of it. And you just don't take off for New York and join. As I say I never knew but one--and he was a seedy little teetotaler whose breath stunk. We had a fight. Not that I hold that against the Communists. The main fact is I don't think so much of Stalin and Russia. I hate every damn country and government there is. But even so maybe I ought to joined up with the Communists first place. I'm not certain one way or the other. What do you think?'",0
6258,"Singer wrinkled his forehead and considered. He reached for his silver pencil and wrote on his pad of paper that he didn't know. 'But there's this. You see, we just can't settle down after knowing, but we got to act. And some of us go nuts. There's too much to do and you don't know where to start. It makes you crazy. Even me-- I've done things that when I look back at them they don't seem rational. Once I started an organization myself. I picked out twenty lintheads and talked to them until I thought they knew. Our motto was one word: Action. Huh! We meant to start riots--stir up all the big trouble we could. Our ultimate goal was freedom--but a real freedom, a great freedom made possible only by the sense of justice of the human soul. Our motto, ""Action,"" signified the razing of capitalism. In the constitution (drawn up by myself) certain statutes dealt with the swapping of our motto from ""Action"" to ""Freedom"" as soon as our work was through.'",0
6259,"Jake sharpened the end of a match and picked a troublesome cavity in a tooth. After a moment he continued:  'Then when the constitution was all written down and the first followers well organized--then I went out on a hitchhiking tour to organize component units of the society. Within three months I came back, and what do you reckon I found? What was the first heroic action? Had their righteous fury overcome planned action so that they had gone ahead without me? Was it destruction, murder, revolution?'",0
6260,"Jake leaned forward in his chair. After a pause he said somberly:  'My friend, they had stole the fifty-seven dollars and thirty cents from the treasury to buy uniform caps and free Saturday suppers. I caught them sitting around the conference table, rolling the bones, their caps on their heads, and a ham and a gallon of gin in easy reach. '",0
6261,"A timid smile from Singer followed Jake's outburst of laughter. After a while the smile on Singer's face grew strained and faded. Jake still laughed. The vein in his forehead swelled, his face was dusky red. He laughed too long.",0
6262,"Singer looked up at the clock and indicated the time--half-past twelve. He took his watch, his silver pencil and pad, his cigarettes and matches from the mantel and distributed them among his pockets. It was dinner-time.",0
6263,"But Jake still laughed. There was something maniacal in the sound of his laughter. He walked about the room, jingling the change in his pockets. His long, powerful arms swung tense and awkward. He began to name over parts of his coming meal. When he spoke of food his face was fierce with gusto. With each word he raised his upper lip like a ravenous animal.",0
6264,"'Roast beef with gravy. Rice. And cabbage and light bread. And a big hunk of apple pie. I'm famished. Oh, Johnny, I can hear the Yankees coming. And speaking of meals, my friend, did I ever tell you about Mr. Clark Patterson, the gentleman who owns the Sunny Dixie Show? He's so fat he hasn't seen his privates for twenty years, and all day he sits in his trailer playing solitaire and smoking reefer. He orders his meals from a short-order joint near-by and every day he breaks his fast with----'  Jake stepped back so that Singer could leave the room.",0
6265,"He always hung back at doorways when he was with the mute. He always followed and expected Singer to lead. As they descended the stairs he continued to talk with nervous volubility. He kept his brown, wide eyes on Singer's face.",0
6266,"The afternoon was soft and mild. They stayed indoors. Jake had brought back with them a quart of whiskey. He sat brooding and silent on the foot of the bed, leaning now and then to fill his glass from the bottle on the floor. Singer was at his table by the window playing a game of chess. Jake had relaxed somewhat. He watched the game of his friend and felt the mild, quiet afternoon merge with the darkness of evening. The firelight made dark, silent waves on the walls of the room.",0
6267,But at night the tension came in him again. Singer had put away his chess men and they sat facing each other. Nervousness made Jake's lips twitch raggedly and he drank to soothe himself. A backwash of restlessness and desire overcame him. He drank down the whiskey and began to talk again to Singer. The words swelled within him and gushed from his mouth. He walked from the window to the bed and back again--again and again. And at last the deluge of swollen words took shape and he delivered them to the mute with drunken emphasis:,0
6268,'The things they have done to us! The truths they have turned into lies. The ideals they have fouled and made vile. Take Jesus. He was one of us. He knew. When he said that it is harder for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God--he damn well meant just what he said. But look what the Church has done to Jesus during the last two thousand years. What they have made of him. How they have turned every word he spoke for their own vile ends. Jesus would be framed and in jail if he was living today. Jesus would be one who really knows. Me and Jesus would sit across the table and I would look at him and he would look at me and we would both know that the other knew. Me and Jesus and Karl Marx could all sit at a table and----  'And look what has happened to our freedom.,0
6269,"The men who fought the American Revolution were no more like these D.A.R. dames than I'm a pot-bellied, perfumed Pekingese dog. They meant what they said about freedom. They fought a real revolution. They fought so that this could be a country where every man would be free and equal. Huh! And that meant every man was equal in the sight of Nature--with an equal chance. This didn't mean that twenty per cent of the people were free to rob the other eighty per cent of the means to live. This didn't mean for one rich man to sweat the piss out of ten thousand poor men so that he can get richer. This didn't mean the tyrants were free to get this country in such a fix that millions of people are ready to do anything--cheat, lie, or whack off their right arm--just to work for three squares and a flop. They have made the word freedom a blasphemy. You hear me? They have made the word freedom stink like a skunk to all who know. '",0
6270,"The vein in Jake's forehead throbbed wildly. His mouth worked convulsively. Singer sat up, alarmed. Jake tried to speak again and the words choked in his mouth. A shudder passed through his body. He sat down in the chair and pressed his trembling lips with his fingers. Then he said huskily:  'It's this way, Singer.",0
6271,Being mad is no good. Nothing we can do is any good. That's the way it seems to me. All we can do is go around telling the truth. And as soon as enough of the don't-knows have learned this truth then there won't be any use for fighting. The only thing for us to do is let them know. All that's needed. But how? Huh?',0
6272,"The fire shadows lapped against the walls. The dark, shadowy waves rose higher and the room took on motion. The room rose and fell and all balance was gone. Alone Jake felt himself sink downward, slowly in wavelike motions downward into a shadowed ocean. In helplessness and terror he strained his eyes, but he could see nothing except the dark and scarlet waves that roared hungrily over him. Then at last he made out the thing which he sought. The mute's face was faint and very far away. Jake closed his eyes.",0
6273,"The next morning he awoke very late. Singer had been gone for hours. There was bread, cheese, an orange, and a pot of coffee on the table. When he had finished his breakfast it was time for work. He walked somberly, his head bent, across the town toward his room. When he reached the neighborhood where he lived he passed through a certain narrow street that was flanked on one side by a smoke-blackened brick warehouse. On the wall of this building there was something that vaguely distracted him. He started to walk on, and then his attention was suddenly held. On the wall a message was written in bright red chalk, the letters drawn thickly and curiously formed:",0
6274,"Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth. He read the message twice and looked anxiously up and down the street. No one was in sight. After a few minutes of puzzled deliberation he took from his pocket a thick red pencil and wrote carefully beneath the inscription:  Whoever wrote the above meet me here tomorrow at noon.",0
6275,"Wednesday, November 29. Or the next day. At twelve o'clock the next day he waited before the wall. Now and then he walked impatiently to the corner to look up and down the streets. No one came. After an hour he had to leave for the show.",0
6276,"The next day he waited, also. Then on Friday there was a long, slow winter rain. The wall was sodden and the messages streaked so that no word could be read. The rain continued, gray and bitter and cold.",0
6277,"[5] 'Mick,' Bubber said. 'I come to believe we all gonna drown. '",0
6278,"It was true that it like to never quit raining. Mrs. Wells rode them back and forth to school in her car, and every afternoon they had to stay on the front porch or in the house. She and Bubber played Parcheesi and Old Maid and shot marbles on the living-room rug. It was nearing along toward Christmas time and Bubber began to talk about the Little Lord Jesus and the red bicycle he wanted Santa Claus to bring him. The rain was silver on the windowpanes and the sky was wet and cold and gray. The river rose so high that some of the factory people had to move out of their houses. Then when it looked like the rain would keep on and on forever it suddenly stopped. They woke up one morning and the bright sun was shining. By afternoon the weather was almost warm as summer. Mick came home late from school and Bubber and Ralph and Spareribs were on the front sidewalk. The kids looked hot and sticky and their winter clothes had a sour smell. Bubber had his slingshot and a pocketful of rocks. Ralph sat up in his wagon, his hat crooked on his head, and he was fretful. Spareribs had his new rifle with him. The sky was a wonderful blue.",0
6279,"'We waited for you a long time, Mick,' Bubber said. 'Where you been?' She jumped up the front steps three at a time and threw her sweater toward the hat rack. ' Practicing on the piano in the gym.'",0
6280,Every afternoon she stayed after school for an hour to play. The gym was crowded and noisy because the girls' team had basketball games. Twice today she was hit on the head with the ball. But getting a chance to sit at a piano was worth any amount of knocks and trouble. She would arrange bunches of notes together until the sound came that she wanted. It was easier than she had thought. After the first two or three hours she figured out some sets of chords in the bass that would fit in with the main tune her right hand was playing. She could pick out almost any piece now. And she made up new music too. That was better than just copying tunes. When her hands hunted out these beautiful new sounds it was the best feeling she had ever known.,0
6281,"She wanted to learn how to read music already written down. Delores Brown had taken music lessons for five years. She paid Delores the fifty cents a week she got for lunch money to give her lessons. This made her very hungry all through the day. Delores played a good many fast, runny pieces--but Delores did not know how to answer all the questions she wanted to know. Delores only taught her about the different scales, the major and minor chords, the values of the notes, and such beginning rules as those.",0
6282,"Mick slammed the door of the kitchen stove. 'This all we got to eat?'  'Honey, it the best I can do for you,' Portia said. Just cornpones and margarine. As she ate she drank a glass of water to help wash down the swallows.",0
6283,'Quit acting so greedy. Nobody going to snatch it out your hand. ',0
6284,The kids still hung around in front of the house. Bubber had put his slingshot in his pocket and now he played with the rifle. Spareribs was ten years old and his father had died the month before and this had been his father's gun. All the smaller kids loved to handle that rifle. Every few minutes Bubber would haul the gun up to his shoulder. He took aim and made a loud pow sound.,0
6285,"'Don't monkey with the trigger,' said Spareribs. 'I got the gun loaded. '",0
6286,"Mick finished the cornbread and looked around for something to do. Harry Minowitz was sitting on his front porch banisters with the newspaper. She was glad to see him. For a joke she threw up her arm and hollered to him, 'Heil!'",0
6287,"But Harry didn't take it as a joke. He went into his front hall and shut the door. It was easy to hurt his feelings. She was sorry, because lately she and Harry had been right good friends. They had always played in the same gang when they were kids, but in the last three years he had been at Vocational while she was still in grammar school. Also he worked at part-time jobs. He grew up very suddenly and quit hanging around the back and front yards with kids. Sometimes she could see him reading the paper in his bedroom or undressing late at night. In mathematics and history he was the smartest boy at Vocational. Often, now that she was in high school too, they would meet each other on the way home and walk together. They were in the same shop class, and once the teacher made them partners to assemble a motor. He read books and kept up with the newspapers every day. World politics were all the time on his mind. He talked slow, and sweat stood out on his forehead when he was very serious about something. And now she had made him mad with her.",0
6288,"'I wonder has Harry still got his gold piece,' Spareribs said. 'What gold piece?'  'When a Jew boy is born they put a gold piece in the bank for him. That's what Jews do.'",0
6289,"'Shucks. You got it mixed up,' she said. 'It's Catholics you're thinking about. Catholics buy a pistol for a baby soon as it's born. Some day the Catholics mean to start a war and kill everybody else. '",0
6290,"'Nuns give me a funny feeling,' Spareribs said. 'It scares me when I see one on the street.' She sat down on the steps and laid her head on her knees. She went into the inside room. With her it was like there was two places--the inside room and the outside room. School and the family and the things that happened every day were in the outside room. Mister Singer was in both rooms. Foreign countries and plans and music were in the inside room. The songs she thought about were there. And the symphony. When she was by herself in this inside room the music she had heard that night after the party would come back to her. This symphony grew slow like a big flower in her mind. During the day sometimes, or when she had just waked up in the morning, a new part of the symphony would suddenly come to her. Then she would have to go into the inside room and listen to it many times and try to join it into the parts of the symphony she remembered. The inside room was a very private place. She could be in the middle of a house full of people and still feel like she was locked up by herself.",0
6291,Spareribs stuck his dirty hand up to her eyes because she had been staring off at space. She slapped him. 'What is a nun?' Bubber asked.,0
6292,"'A Catholic lady,' Spareribs said. ' A Catholic lady with a big black dress that comes up over her head. '",0
6293,"She was tired of hanging around with the kids. She would go to the library and look at pictures in the National Geographic. Photographs of all the foreign places in the world. Paris, France. And big ice glaciers. And the wild jungles in Africa.",0
6294,"'You kids see that Ralph don't get out in the street,' she said. Bubber rested the big rifle on his shoulder. 'Bring me a story back with you.'",0
6295,It was like that kid had been born knowing how to read. He was only in the second grade but he loved to read stories by himself--and he never asked anybody else to read to him. ' What kind you want this time?'  'Pick out some stories with something to eat in them.,0
6296,"I like that one a whole lot about them German kids going out in the forest and coming to this house made out of all different kinds of candy and the witch. I like a story with something to eat in it.' 'I'll look for one,' said Mick.",0
6297,"'But I'm getting kinda tired of candy,' Bubber said. 'See if you can't bring me a story with something like a barbecue sandwich in it. But if you can't find none of them I'd like a cowboy story.'",0
6298,She was ready to leave when suddenly she stopped and stared. The kids stared too. They all stood still and looked at Baby Wilson coming down the steps of her house across the street.,0
6299,"'Ain't Baby cute!' said Bubber softly. Maybe it was the sudden hot, sunny day after all those rainy weeks. Maybe it was because their dark winter clothes were ugly to them on an afternoon like this one. Anyway Baby looked like a fairy or something in the picture show. She had on her last year's soirée costume--with a little pink-gauze skirt that stuck out short and stiff, a pink body waist, pink dancing shoes, and even a little pink pocketbook. With her yellow hair she was all pink and white and gold--and so small and clean that it almost hurt to watch her. She prissed across the street in a cute way, but would not turn her face toward them.",0
6300,"'Come over here,' said Bubber. 'Lemme look at your little pink pocketbook----'  Baby passed them along the edge of the street with her head held to one side. She had made up her mind not to speak to them.",0
6301,"There was a strip of grass between the sidewalk and the street, and when Baby reached it she stood still for a second and then turned a handspring. 'Don't pay no mind to her,' said Spareribs. 'She always tries to show off. She's going down to Mister Brannon's café to get candy. He's her uncle and she gets it free. '",0
6302,"Bubber rested the end of the rifle on the ground. The big gun was too heavy for him. As he watched Baby walk off down the street he kept pulling the straggly bangs of his hair. 'That sure is a cute little pink pocketbook,' he said.",0
6303,"'Her Mama always talks about how talented she is,' said Spareribs. 'She thinks she's gonna get Baby in the movies. '",0
6304,"It was too late to go look at the National Geographic. Supper was almost ready. Ralph tuned up to cry and she took him off the wagon and put him on the ground. Now it was December, and to a kid Bubber's age that was a long time from summer. All last summer Baby had come out in that pink soirée costume and danced in the middle of the street. At first the kids would flock around and watch her, but soon they got tired of it. Bubber was the only one who would watch her as she came out to dance. He would sit on the curb and yell to her when he saw a car coming. He had watched Baby do her soirée dance a hundred times--but summer had been gone for three months and now it seemed new to him again.",0
6305,"'I sure do wish I had a costume,' Bubber said. 'What kind do you want?'  'A real cool costume. A real pretty one made out of all different colors. Like a butterfly. That's what I want for Christmas. That and a bicycle!'  'Sissy,' said Spareribs.",0
6306,Bubber hauled the big rifle up to his shoulder again and took aim at a house across the street. 'I'd dance around in my costume if I had one. I'd wear it every day to school.',0
6307,Mick sat on the front steps and kept her eyes on Ralph. Bubber wasn't a sissy like Spareribs said. He just loved pretty things. She'd better not let old Spareribs get away with that.,0
6308,"'A person's got to fight for every single thing they get,' she said slowly. ' And I've noticed a lot of times that the farther down a kid comes in the family the better the kid really is. Youngest kids are always the toughest. I'm pretty hard 'cause I've a lot of them on top of me. Bubber--he looks sick, and likes pretty things, but he's got guts underneath that. If all this is true Ralph sure ought to be a real strong one when he's old enough to get around. Even though he's just seventeen months old I can read something hard and tough in that Ralph's face already. '",0
6309,Ralph looked around because he knew he was being talked about. Spareribs sat down on the ground and grabbed Ralph's hat off his head and shook it in his face to tease him. 'All right!' Mick said. 'You know what I'll do to you if you start him to cry. You just better watch out. ',0
6310,Everything was quiet. The sun was behind the roofs of the houses and the sky in the west was purple and pink. On the next block there was the sound of kids skating. Bubber leaned up against a tree and he seemed to be dreaming about something. The smell of supper came out of the house and it would be time to eat soon.,0
6311,"'Lookit,' Bubber said suddenly. 'Here comes Baby again. She sure is pretty in the pink costume.'",0
6312,"Baby walked toward them slowly. She had been given a prize box of popcorn candy and was reaching in the box for the prize. She walked in that same prissy, dainty way. You could tell that she knew they were all looking at her.",0
6313,"'Please, Baby----' Bubber said when she started to pass them. 'Lemme see your little pink pocketbook and touch your pink costume.' Baby started humming a song to herself and did not listen. She passed by without letting Bubber play with her. She only ducked her head and grinned at him a little.",0
6314,"Bubber still had the big rifle up to his shoulder. He made a loud pow sound and pretended like he had shot. Then he called to Baby again--in a soft, sad voice like he was calling a little kitty. 'Please Baby-- Come here, Baby----'  He was too quick for Mick to stop him.",0
6315,She had just seen his hand on the trigger when there was the terrible ping of the gun. Baby crumpled down to the sidewalk. It was like she was nailed to the steps and couldn't move or scream. Spareribs had his arm up over his head.,0
6316,"Bubber was the only one that didn't realize. 'Get up, Baby,' he hollered. 'I ain't mad with you. '",0
6317,"It all happened in a second. The three of them reached Baby at the same time. She lay crumpled down on the dirty sidewalk. Her skirt was over her head, showing her pink panties and her little white legs. Her hands were open--in one there was the prize from the candy and in the other the pocketbook. There was blood all over her hair ribbon and the top of her yellow curls. She was shot in the head and her face was turned down toward the ground.",0
6318,So much happened in a second. Bubber screamed and dropped the gun and ran. She stood with her hands up to her face and screamed too. Then there were many people. Her Dad was the first to get there. He carried Baby into the house.,0
6319,"'She's dead,' said Spareribs. 'She's shot through the eyes. I seen her face.'",0
6320,"Mick walked up and down the sidewalk, and her tongue stuck in her mouth when she tried to ask was Baby killed. Mrs. Wilson came running down the block from the beauty parlor where she worked. She went into the house and came back out again. She walked up and down in the street, crying and pulling a ring on and off her finger. Then the ambulance came and the doctor went in to Baby. Mick followed him. Baby was lying on the bed in the front room. The house was quiet as a church.",0
6321,Baby looked like a pretty little doll on the bed. Except for the blood she did not seem hurt. The doctor bent over and looked at her head. After he finished they took Baby out on a stretcher. Mrs. Wilson and her Dad got into the ambulance with her.,0
6322,The house was still quiet. Everybody had forgotten about Bubber. He was nowhere around. An hour passed. Her Mama and Hazel and Etta and all the boarders waited in the front room. Mister Singer stood in the doorway. After a long time her Dad came home. He said Baby wouldn't die but that her skull was fractured. He asked for Bubber. Nobody knew where he was. It was dark outside. They called Bubber in the back yard and in the street. They sent Spareribs and some other boys out to hunt for him. It looked like Bubber had gone clear out of the neighborhood. Harry went around to a house where they thought he might be.,0
6323,"Her Dad walked up and down the front porch. 'I never have whipped any of my kids yet,' he kept saying. 'I never believed in it. But I'm sure going to lay it onto that kid as soon as I get my hands on him.'",0
6324,Mick sat on the banisters and watched down the dark street. 'I can manage Bubber. Once he comes back I can take care of him all right. ',0
6325,"'You go out and hunt for him. You can find him better than anybody else.' As soon as her Dad said that she suddenly knew where Bubber was. In the back yard there was a big oak and in the summer they had built a tree house. They had hauled a big box up in this oak, and Bubber used to love to sit up in the tree house by himself. Mick left the family and the boarders on the front porch and walked back through the alley to the dark yard.",0
6326,"She stood for a minute by the trunk of the tree. 'Bubber--,' she said quietly. 'It's Mick.'",0
6327,"He didn't answer, but she knew he was there. It was like she could smell him. She swung up on the lowest branch and climbed slowly. She was really mad with that kid and would have to teach him a lesson. When she reached the tree house she spoke to him again--and still there wasn't any answer. She climbed into the big box and felt around the edges. At last she touched him. He was scrouged up in a corner and his legs were trembling. He had been holding his breath, and when she touched him the sobs and the breath came out all at once.",0
6328,"'I--I didn't mean Baby to fall. She was just so little and cute--seemed to me like I just had to take a pop at her.' Mick sat down on the floor of the tree house. 'Baby's dead,' she said. 'They got a lot of people hunting for you. '",0
6329,Bubber quit crying. He was very quiet. 'You know what Dad's doing in the house?',0
6330,"It was like she could hear Bubber listening. 'You know Warden Lawes--you heard him over the radio. And you know Sing Sing. Well, our Dad's writing a letter to Warden Lawes for him to be a little bit kind to you when they catch you and send you to Sing Sing.'",0
6331,The words were so awful-sounding in the dark that a shiver came over her. She could feel Bubber trembling. 'They got little electric chairs there--just your size. And when they turn on the juice you just fry up like a piece of burnt bacon. Then you go to Hell.',0
6332,Bubber was squeezed up in the corner and there was not a sound from him. She climbed over the edge of the box to get down. 'You better stay up here because they got policemen guarding the yard. Maybe in a few days I can bring you something to eat.',0
6333,"Mick leaned against the trunk of the oak tree. That would teach Bubber all right. She had always managed him and she knew more about that kid than anybody else. Once, about a year or two ago, he was always wanting to stop off behind bushes and pee and play with himself awhile. She had caught on to that pretty quick. She gave him a good slap every time it happened and in three days he was cured. Afterwards he never even peed normal like other kids--he held his hands behind him. She always had to nurse that Bubber and she could always manage him. In a little while she would go back up to the tree house and bring him in. After this he would never want to pick up a gun again in all his life.",0
6334,"There was still this dead feeling in the house. The boarders all sat on the front porch without talking or rocking in the chairs. Her Dad and her Mama were in the front room. Her Dad drank beer out of a bottle and walked up and down the floor. Baby was going to get well all right, so this worry was not about her. And nobody seemed to be anxious about Bubber. It was something else.",0
6335,"'That Bubber!' said Etta. 'I'm shamed to go out of the house after this,' Hazel said. Etta and Hazel went into the middle room and closed the door. Bill was in his room at the back. She didn't want to talk with them. She stood around in the front hall and thought it over by herself.",0
6336,"Her Dad's footsteps stopped. 'It was deliberate,' he said. 'It's not like the kid was just fooling with the gun and it went off by accident. Everybody who saw it said he took deliberate aim.'",0
6337,"'I wonder when we'll hear from Mrs. Wilson,' her Mama said. 'We'll hear plenty, all right!' 'I reckon we will.'",0
6338,"Now that the sun was down the night was cold again like November. The people came in from the front porch and sat in the living-room--but nobody lighted a fire. Mick's sweater was hanging on the hatrack, so she put it on and stood with her shoulders bent over to keep warm. She thought about Bubber sitting out in the cold, dark tree house. He had really believed every word she said. But he sure deserved to worry some. He had nearly killed that Baby.",0
6339,"'Mick, can't you think of some place where Bubber might be?' her Dad asked. 'He's in the neighborhood, I reckon.'",0
6340,Her Dad walked up and down with the empty beer bottle in his hand. He walked like a blind man and there was sweat on his face. 'The poor kid's scared to come home. If we could find him I'd feel better. I've never laid a hand on Bubber. He oughtn't be scared of me.',0
6341,She would wait until an hour and a half was gone. By that time he would be plenty sorry for what he did. She always could manage that Bubber and make him learn.,0
6342,"After a while there was a big excitement in the house. Her Dad telephoned again to the hospital to see how Baby was, and in a few minutes Mrs. Wilson called back. She said she wanted to have a talk with them and would come to the house.",0
6343,Her Dad still walked up and down the front room like a blind man. He drank three more bottles of beer. 'The way it all happened she can sue my britches off. All she could get would be the house outside of the mortgage. But the way it happened we don't have any comeback at all.',0
6344,Suddenly Mick thought about something. Maybe they would really try Bubber in court and put him in a childrens' jail. Maybe Mrs. Wilson would send him to reform school. Maybe they would really do something terrible to Bubber. She wanted to go out to the tree house right away and sit with him and tell him not to worry. Bubber was always so thin and little and smart. She would kill anybody that tried to send that kid out of the family. She wanted to kiss him and bite him because she loved him so much.,0
6345,But she couldn't miss anything. Mrs. Wilson would be there in a few minutes and she had to know what was going on. Then she would run out and tell Bubber that all the things she said were lies. And he would really have learned the lesson he had coming to him.,0
6346,"A ten-cent taxicab drove up to the sidewalk. Everybody waited on the front porch, very quiet and scared. Mrs. Wilson got out of the taxi with Mister Brannon. She could hear her Dad grinding his teeth together in a nervous way as they came up the steps. They went into the front room and she followed along after them and stood in the doorway. Etta and Hazel and Bill and the boarders kept out of it.",0
6347,"'I've come to talk over all this with you,' Mrs. Wilson said. The front room looked tacky and dirty and she saw Mister Brannon notice everything. The mashed celluloid doll and the beads and junk Ralph played with were scattered on the floor. There was beer on her Dad's workbench, and the pillows on the bed where her Dad and Mama slept were right gray.",0
6348,Mrs. Wilson kept pulling the wedding ring on and off her finger. By the side of her Mister Brannon was very calm. He sat with his legs crossed. His jaws were blue-black and he looked like a gangster in the movies. He had always had this grudge against her. He always spoke to her in this rough voice different from the way he talked to other people. Was it because he knew about the time she and Bubber swiped a pack of chewing-gum off his counter? She hated him.,0
6349,"'It all boils down to this,' said Mrs. Wilson. 'Your kid shot my Baby in the head on purpose.' Mick stepped into the middle of the room. 'No, he didn't,' she said. 'I was right there. Bubber had been aiming that gun at me and Ralph and everything around there. He just happened to aim it at Baby and his finger slipped. I was right there. '",0
6350,Mister Brannon rubbed his nose and looked at her in a sad way. She sure did hate him. 'I know how you all feel--so I want to come to the point right now.',0
6351,"Mick's Mama rattled a bunch of keys and her Dad sat very still with his big hands hanging over his knees. 'Bubber didn't have it in his mind beforehand,' Mick said. 'He just----'  Mrs. Wilson jabbed the ring on and off her finger.",0
6352,'Wait a minute. I know how everything is. I could bring it to court and sue you for every cent you own. ',0
6353,"Her Dad didn't have any expression on his face. 'I tell you one thing,' he said. 'We don't have much to sue for. All we got is----'  'Just listen to me,' said Mrs. Wilson.",0
6354,"'I haven't come here with any lawyer to sue you. Bartholomew--Mister Brannon--and I talked it over when we came and we just about agree on the main points. In the first place, I want to do the fair, honest thing--and in the second place, I don't want Baby's name mixed up in no common lawsuit at her age. '",0
6355,"There was not a sound and everybody in the room sat stiff in their chairs. Only Mister Brannon halfway smiled at Mick, but she squinted her eyes back at him in a tough way. Mrs. Wilson was very nervous and her hand shook when she lighted a cigarette. 'I don't want to have to sue you or anything like that. All I want is for you to be fair. I'm not asking you to pay for all the suffering and crying Baby went through with until they gave her something to sleep. There's not any pay that would make up for that. And I'm not asking you to pay for the damage this will do to her career and the plans we had made. She's going to have to wear a bandage for several months. She won't get to dance in the soirée--maybe there'll even be a little bald place on her head. '",0
6356,"Mrs. Wilson and her Dad looked at each other like they was hypnotized. Then Mrs. Wilson reached around to her pocketbook and took out a slip of paper. 'The things you got to pay are just the actual price of what it will cost us in money. There's Baby's private room in the hospital and a private nurse until she can come home. There's the operating room and the doctor's bill--and for once I intend the doctor to be paid right away. Also, they shaved all Baby's hair off and you got to pay me for the permanent wave I took her to Atlanta to get--so when her hair grows back natural she can have another one. And there's the price of her costume and other little extra bills like that. I'll write all the items down just as soon as I know what they'll be. I'm trying to be just as fair and honest as I can, and you'll have to pay the total when I bring it to you.'",0
6357,"Her Mama smoothed her dress over her knees and took a quick, short breath. 'Seems to me like the childrens' ward would be a lot better than a private room. When Mick had pneumonia----'  'I said a private room.",0
6358,"' Mister Brannon held out his white, stumpy hands and balanced them like they was on scales. 'Maybe in a day or two Baby can move into a double room with some other kid. '",0
6359,Mrs. Wilson spoke hard-boiled. 'You heard what I said. Long as your kid shot my Baby she certainly ought to have every advantage until she gets well. ',0
6360,"'You're in your rights,' her Dad said. ' God knows we don't have anything now--but maybe I can scrape it up. I realize you're not trying to take advantage of us and I appreciate it. We'll do what we can.'",0
6361,"She wanted to stay and hear everything that they said, but Bubber was on her mind. When she thought of him sitting up in the dark, cold tree house thinking about Sing Sing she felt uneasy. She went out of the room and down the hall toward the back door. The wind was blowing and the yard was very dark except for the yellow square that came from the light in the kitchen. When she looked back she saw Portia sitting at the table with her long, thin hands up to her face, very still. The yard was lonesome and the wind made quick, scary shadows and a mourning kind of sound in the darkness.",0
6362,She stood under the oak tree. Then just as she started to reach for the first limb a terrible notion came over her. It came to her all of a sudden that Bubber was gone. She called him and he did not answer. She climbed quick and quiet as a cat.,0
6363,"'Say! Bubber!' Without feeling in the box she knew he wasn't there. To make sure she got into the box and felt in all the corners. The kid was gone. He must have started down the minute she left. He was running away for sure now, and with a smart kid like Bubber it was no telling where they'd catch him.",0
6364,She scrambled down the tree and ran to the front porch. Mrs. Wilson was leaving and they had all come out to the front steps with her. 'Dad!' she said. 'We got to do something about Bubber. He's run away. I'm sure he left our block. We all got to get out and hunt him. ',0
6365,"Nobody knew where to go or how to begin. Her Dad walked up and down the street, looking in all the alleys. Mister Brannon telephoned for a ten-cent taxi for Mrs. Wilson and then stayed to help with the hunt. Mister Singer sat on the banisters of the porch and he was the only person who kept calm. They all waited for Mick to plan out the best places to look for Bubber. But the town was so big and the little kid was so smart that she couldn't think what to do.",0
6366,Maybe he had gone to Portia's house over in Sugar Hill. She went back into the kitchen where Portia was sitting at the table with her hands up to her face. 'I got this sudden notion he went down to your house. Help us hunt him.',0
6367,'How come I didn't think of that! I bet a nickel my little scared Bubber been staying in my home all the time. ',0
6368,Mister Brannon had borrowed an automobile. He and Mister Singer and Mick's Dad got into the car with her and Portia. Nobody knew what Bubber was feeling except her. Nobody knew he had really run away like he was escaping to save his life.,0
6369,"Portia's house was dark except for the checkered moonlight on the floor. As soon as they stepped inside they could tell there was nobody in the two rooms. Portia lighted the front lamp. The rooms had a colored smell, and they were crowded with cut-out pictures on the walls and the lace table covers and lace pillows on the bed. Bubber was not there.",0
6370,"'He been here,' Portia suddenly said. 'I can tell somebody been in here. '",0
6371,"Mister Singer found the pencil and piece of paper on the kitchen table. He read it quickly and then they all looked at it. The writing was round and scraggly and the smart little kid hadn't misspelled but one word. The note said:  Dear Portia, I gone to Florada.",0
6372,"Tell every body. Yours truly, Bubber Kelly They stood around surprised and stumped. Her Dad looked out the doorway and picked his nose with his thumb in a worried way. They were all ready to pile in the car and ride toward the highway leading south.",0
6373,"'Wait a minute,' Mick said. 'Even if Bubber is seven years old he's got brains enough not to tell us where he's going if he wants to run away. That about Florida is just a trick. '",0
6374,'A trick?' her Dad said. 'Yeah. There only two places Bubber knows very much about. One is Florida and the other is Atlanta. Me and Bubber and Ralph have been on the Atlanta road many a time. He knows how to start there and that's where he's headed. He always talks about what he's going to do when he gets a chance to go to Atlanta.',0
6375,"They went out to the automobile again. She was ready to climb into the back seat when Portia pinched her on the elbow. 'You know what Bubber done?' she said in a quiet voice. 'Don't you tell nobody else, but my Bubber done also taken my gold earrings off my dresser. I never thought my Bubber would have done such a thing to me.'",0
6376,"Mister Brannon started the automobile. They rode slow, looking up and down the streets for Bubber, headed toward the Atlanta road. It was true that in Bubber there was a tough, mean streak. He was acting different today than he had ever acted before. Up until now he was always a quiet little kid who never really done anything mean. When anybody's feelings were hurt it always made him ashamed and nervous. Then how come he could do all the things he had done today?",0
6377,They drove very slow out the Atlanta road. They passed the last line of houses and came to the dark fields and woods. All along they had stopped to ask if anyone had seen Bubber. 'Has a little barefooted kid in corduroy knickers been by this way?' But even after they had gone about ten miles nobody had seen or noticed him. The wind came in cold and strong from the open windows and it was late at night.,0
6378,"They rode a little farther and then went back toward town. Her Dad and Mister Brannon wanted to look up all the children in the second grade, but she made them turn around and go back on the Atlanta road again. All the while she remembered the words she had said to Bubber. About Baby being dead and Sing Sing and Warden Lawes. About the small electric chairs that were just his size, and Hell. In the dark the words had sounded terrible.",0
6379,"They rode very slow for about half a mile out of town, and then suddenly she saw Bubber. The lights of the car showed him up in front of them very plain. It was funny. He was walking along the edge of the road and he had his thumb out trying to get a ride. Portia's butcher knife was stuck in his belt, and on the wide, dark road he looked so small that it was like he was five years old instead of seven.",0
6380,"They stopped the automobile and he ran to get in. He couldn't see who they were, and his face had the squint-eyed look it always had when he took aim with a marble. Her Dad held him by the collar. He hit with his fists and kicked. Then he had the butcher knife in his hand. Their Dad yanked it away from him just in time. He fought like a little tiger in a trap, but finally they got him into the car. Their Dad held him in his lap on the way home and Bubber sat very stiff, not leaning against anything.",0
6381,"They had to drag him into the house, and all the neighbors and the boarders were out to see the commotion. They dragged him into the front room and when he was there he backed off into a corner, holding his fists very tight and with his squinted eyes looking from one person to the other like he was ready to fight the whole crowd. He hadn't said one word since they came into the house until he began to scream: 'Mick done it! I didn't do it. Mick done it!'",0
6382,There were never any kind of yells like the ones Bubber made. The veins in his neck stood out and his fists were hard as little rocks. 'You can't get me! Nobody can get me!' he kept yelling.,0
6383,Mick shook him by the shoulder. She told him the things she had said were stories. He finally knew what she was saying but he wouldn't hush. It looked like nothing could stop that screaming.,0
6384,"'I hate everybody! I hate everybody!' They all just stood around. Mister Brannon rubbed his nose and looked down at the floor. Then finally he went out very quietly. Mister Singer was the only one who seemed to know what it was all about. Maybe this was because he didn't hear that awful noise. His face was still calm, and whenever Bubber looked at him he seemed to get quieter. Mister Singer was different from any other man, and at times like this it would be better if other people would let him manage. He had more sense and he knew things that ordinary people couldn't know. He just looked at Bubber, and after a while the kid quieted down enough so that their Dad could get him to bed.",0
6385,"In the bed he lay on his face and cried. He cried with long, big sobs that made him tremble all over. He cried for an hour and nobody in the three rooms could sleep. Bill moved to the living-room sofa and Mick got into bed with Bubber. He wouldn't let her touch him or snug up to him. Then after another hour of crying and hiccoughing he went to sleep.",0
6386,"She was awake a long time. In the dark she put her arms around him and held him very close. She touched him all over and kissed him everywhere. He was so soft and little and there was this salty, boy smell about him. The love she felt was so hard that she had to squeeze him to her until her arms were tired. In her mind she thought about Bubber and music together. It was like she could never do anything good enough for him. She would never hit him or even tease him again. She slept all night with her arms around his head. Then in the morning when she woke up he was gone.",0
6387,"But after that night there was not much of a chance for her to tease him any more--her or anybody else. After he shot Baby the kid was not ever like little Bubber again. He always kept his mouth shut and he didn't fool around with anybody. Most of the time he just sat in the back yard or in the coal house by himself. It got closer and closer toward Christmas time. She really wanted a piano, but naturally she didn't say anything about that. She told everybody she wanted a Mickey Mouse watch. When they asked Bubber what he wanted from Santa Claus he said he didn't want anything. He hid his marbles and jack-knife and wouldn't let anyone touch his story books.",0
6388,"After that night nobody called him Bubber any more. The big kids in the neighborhood started calling him Baby-Killer Kelly. But he didn't speak much to any person and nothing seemed to bother him. The family called him by his real name--George. At first Mick couldn't stop calling him Bubber and she didn't want to stop. But it was funny how after about a week she just naturally called him George like the others did. But he was a different kid--George--going around by himself always like a person much older and with nobody, not even her, knowing what was really in his mind.",0
6389,"She slept with him on Christmas Eve night. He lay in the dark without talking. 'Quit acting so peculiar,' she said to him. 'Less talk about the wise men and the way the children in Holland put out their wooden shoes instead of hanging up their stockings.'",0
6390,George wouldn't answer. He went to sleep. She got up at four o'clock in the morning and waked everybody in the family. Their Dad built a fire in the front room and then let them go in to the Christmas tree and see what they got. George had an Indian suit and Ralph a rubber doll. The rest of the family just got clothes. She looked all through her stocking for the Mickey Mouse watch but it wasn't there. Her presents were a pair of brown Oxford shoes and a box of cherry candy. While it was still dark she and George went out on the sidewalk and cracked nigger-toes and shot firecrackers and ate up the whole two-layer box of cherry candy. And by the time it was daylight they were sick to the stomach and tired out. She lay down on the sofa. She shut her eyes and went into the inside room.,0
6391,"[6] At eight o'clock Doctor Copeland sat at his desk, studying a sheaf of papers by the bleak morning light from the window. Beside him the tree, a thick-fringed cedar, rose up dark and green to the ceiling. Since the first year he began to practice he had given an annual party on Christmas Day, and now all was in readiness. Rows of benches and chairs lined the walls of the front rooms. Throughout the house there was the sweet spiced odor of newly baked cake and steaming coffee. In the office with him Portia sat on a bench against the wall, her hands cupped beneath her chin, her body bent almost double.",0
6392,"'Father, you been scrouched over that desk since five o'clock. You got no business to be up. You ought to stayed in bed until time for the to-do.'",0
6393,Doctor Copeland moistened his thick lips with his tongue. So much was on his mind that he had no attention to give to Portia. Her presence fretted him.,0
6394,"At last he turned to her irritably. 'Why do you sit there moping?' 'I just got worries,' she said. 'For one thing, I worried about our Willie.'  'William?'  'You see he been writing me regular ever Sunday.",0
6395,"The letter will get here on Monday or Tuesday. But last week he didn't write. Course I not really anxious. Willie--he always so good-natured and sweet I know he going to be all right. He been transferred from the prison to the chain gang and they going to work up somewhere north of Atlanta. Two weeks ago he wrote this here letter to say they going to attend a church service today, and he done asked me to send him his suit of clothes and his red tie. '",0
6396,"'Is that all William said?'  'He written that this Mr. B. F. Mason is at the prison, too. And that he run into Buster Johnston--he a boy Willie used to know. And also he done asked me to please send him his harp because he can't be happy without he got his harp to play on. I done sent everything. Also a checker set and a white-iced cake. But I sure hope I hears from him in the next few days. '",0
6397,"Doctor Copeland's eyes glowed with fever and he could not rest his hands. 'Daughter, we shall have to discuss this later. It is getting late and I must finish here. You go back to the kitchen and see that all is ready. '",0
6398,"Portia stood up and tried to make her face bright and happy. 'What you done decided about that five-dollar prize?' 'As yet I have been unable to decide just what is the wisest course,' he said carefully.",0
6399,"A certain friend of his, a Negro pharmacist, gave an award of five dollars every year to the high school student who wrote the best essay on a given subject. The pharmacist always made Doctor Copeland sole judge of the papers and the winner was announced at the Christmas party. The subject of the composition this year was 'My Ambition: How I Can Better the Position of the Negro Race in Society.' There was only one essay worthy of real consideration. Yet this paper was so childish and ill-advised that it would hardly be prudent to confer upon it the award. Doctor Copeland put on his glasses and re-read the essay with deep concentration.",0
6400,This is my ambition. First I wish to attend Tuskegee College but I do not wish to be a man like Booker Washington or Doctor Carver. Then when I deem that my education is complete I wish to start off being a fine lawyer like the one who defended the Scottsboro Boys. I would only take cases for colored people against white people. Every day our people are made in every way and by every means to feel that they are inferior. This is not so. We are a Rising Race. And we cannot sweat beneath the white man's burdens for long. We cannot always sow where others reap.,0
6401,"I want to be like Moses, who led the children of Israel from the land of the oppressors. I want to get up a Secret Organization of Colored Leaders and Scholars. All colored people will organize under the direction of these picked leaders and prepare for revolt. Other nations in the world who are interested in the plight of our race and who would like to see the United States divided would come to our aid. All colored people will organize and there will be a revolution, and at the close colored people will take all the territory east of the Mississippi and south of the Potomac. I shall set up a mighty country under the control of the Organization of Colored Leaders and Scholars. No white person will be allowed a passport--and if they get into the country they will have no legal rights.",0
6402,I hate the whole white race and will work always so that the colored race can achieve revenge for all their sufferings. That is my ambition. Doctor Copeland felt the fever warm in his veins. The ticking of the clock on his desk was loud and the sound jarred his nerves. How could he give the award to a boy with such wild notions as this? What should he decide?,0
6403,"The other essays were without any firm content at all. The young people would not think. They wrote only about their ambitions and omitted the last part of the title altogether. Only one point was of some significance. Nine out of the lot of twenty-five began with the sentence, 'I do not want to be a servant.' After that they wished to fly airplanes, or be prizefighters, or preachers or dancers. One girl's sole ambition was to be kind to the poor.",0
6404,"The writer of the essay that troubled him was Lancy Davis. He had known the identity of the author before he turned the last sheet over and saw the signature. Already he had had some trouble with Lancy. His older sister had gone out to work as a servant when she was eleven years old and she had been raped by her employer, a white man past middle age. Then a year or so later he had received an emergency call to attend Lancy.",0
6405,"Doctor Copeland went to the filing case in his bedroom where he kept notes on all of his patients. He took out the card marked 'Mrs. Dan Davis and Family' and glanced through the notations until he reached Lancy's name. The date was four years ago. The entries on him were written with more care than the others and in ink: 'thirteen years old--past puberty. Unsuccessful attempt self-emasculation. Over-sexed and hyperthyroid. Wept boisterously during two visits, though little pain. Voluble--very glad to talk though paranoiac. Environment fair with one exception. See Lucy Davis--mother washerwoman. Intelligent and well worth watching and all possible help. Keep contact. Fee: $1 (?)'  'It is a difficult decision to make this year,' he said to Portia. '",0
6406,"But I suppose I will have to confer the award on Lancy Davis.' 'If you done decide', then--come tell me about some of these here presents. '",0
6407,"The gifts to be distributed at the party were in the kitchen. There were paper sacks of groceries and clothing, all marked with a red Christmas card. Anyone who cared to come was invited to the party, but those who meant to attend had stopped by the house and written (or had asked a friend to write) their names in a guest book kept on the table in the hall for that purpose. The sacks were piled on the floor. There were about forty of them, each one depending in size on the need of the receiver. Some gifts were only small packages of nuts or raisins and others were boxes almost too heavy for a man to lift. The kitchen was crowded with good things. Doctor Copeland stood in the doorway and his nostrils quivered with pride.",0
6408,'I think you done right well this year. Folks certainly have been kindly. ',0
6409,'Pshaw!' he said. 'This is not a hundredth part of what is needed. ',0
6410,"'Now, there you go, Father! I know good and well you just as pleased as you can be. But you don't want to show it. You got to find something to grumble about. Here we haves about four pecks of peas, twenty sacks of meal, about fifteen pounds of side meat, mullet, six dozen eggs, plenty grits, jars of tomatoes and peaches. Apples and two dozen oranges. Also garments. And two mattresses and four blankets. I call this something!'",0
6411,'A drop in the bucket.' Portia pointed to a large box in the corner. ' These here--what you intend to do with them?',0
6412,"The box contained nothing but junk--a headless doll, some dirty lace, a rabbitskin. Doctor Copeland scrutinized each article. 'Do not throw them away. There is use for everything. These are the gifts from our guests who have nothing better to contribute. I will find some purpose for them later. '  'Then suppose you look over these here boxes and sacks so I can commence to tie them up.",0
6413,There ain't going to be room here in the kitchen. Time they all pile in for the refreshments. I just going to put these here presents out on the back steps and in the yard.',0
6414,"The morning sun had risen. The day would be bright and cold. In the kitchen there were rich, sweet odors. A dishpan of coffee was on the stove and iced cakes filled a shelf in the cupboard.",0
6415,"'And none of this comes from white people. All from Colored.'  'No,' said Doctor Copeland. 'That is not wholly true. Mr. Singer contributed a check for twelve dollars to be used for coal. And I have invited him to be present today. '  'Holy Jesus!'",0
6416,Portia said. Twelve dollars!'  'I felt that it was proper to ask him. He is not like other people of the Caucasian race.',0
6417,"'You right,' Portia said. ' But I keep thinking about my Willie. I sure do wish he could enjoy this here party today. And I sure do wish I could get a letter from him. It just prey on my mind. But here! Us got to quit this here talking and get ready. It mighty near time for the party to come.'",0
6418,Time enough remained. Doctor Copeland washed and clothed himself carefully. For a while he tried to rehearse what he would say when the people had all come. But expectation and restlessness would not let him concentrate. Then at ten o'clock the first guests arrived and within half an hour they were all assembled.,0
6419,"'Joyful Christmas gift to you!' said John Roberts, the postman. He moved happily about the crowded room, one shoulder held higher than the other, mopping his face with a white silk handkerchief. 'Many happy returns of the day!'",0
6420,The front of the house was thronged. Guests were blocked at the door and they formed groups on the front porch and in the yard. There was no pushing or rudeness; the turmoil was orderly. Friends called out to each other and strangers were introduced and clasped hands. Children and young people clotted together and moved back toward the kitchen.,0
6421,"'Christmas gift!'  Doctor Copeland stood in the center of the front room by the tree. He was dizzy. He shook hands and answered salutations with confusion. Personal gifts, some tied elaborately with ribbons and others wrapped in newspaper, were thrust into his hands. He could find no place to put them. The air thickened and voices grew louder. Faces whirled about him so that he could recognize no one. His composure returned to him gradually. He found space to lay aside the presents in his arms. The dizziness lessened, the room cleared. He settled his spectacles and began to look around him.",0
6422,"'Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!' There was Marshall Nicolls, the pharmacist, in a long-tailed coat, conversing with his son-in-law who worked on a garbage truck. The preacher from the Most Holy Ascension Church had come. And two deacons from other churches. Highboy, wearing a loud checked suit, moved sociably through the crowd. Husky young dandies bowed to young women in long, bright-colored dresses. There were mothers with children and deliberate old men who spat into gaudy handkerchiefs. The room was warm and noisy.",0
6423,Mr. Singer stood in the doorway. Many people stared at him. Doctor Copeland could not remember if he had welcomed him or not. The mute stood by himself. His face resembled somewhat a picture of Spinoza. A Jewish face. It was good to see him.,0
6424,"The doors and the windows were open. Draughts blew through the room so that the fire roared. The noises quieted. The seats were all filled and the young people sat in rows on the floor. The hall, the porch, even the yard were crowded with silent guests. The time had come for him to speak--and what was he to say? Panic tightened his throat. The room waited. At a sign from John Roberts all sounds were hushed.",0
6425,"'My People,' began Doctor Copeland blankly. There was a pause. Then suddenly the words came to him.",0
6426,'This is the nineteenth year that we have gathered together in this room to celebrate Christmas Day. When our people first heard of the birth of Jesus Christ it was a dark time. Our people were sold as slaves in this town on the courthouse square. Since then we have heard and told the story of His life more times than we could number. So today our story will be a different one.,0
6427,"'One hundred and twenty years ago another man was born in the country that is known as Germany--a country far across the Atlantic Ocean. This man understood as did Jesus. But his thoughts were not concerned with Heaven or the future of the dead. His mission was for the living. For the great masses of human beings who work and suffer and work until they die. For people who take in washing and work as cooks, who pick cotton and work at the hot dye vats of factories. His mission was for us, and the name of this man is Karl Marx.",0
6428,"'Karl Marx was a wise man. He studied and worked and understood the world around him. He said that the world was divided into two classes, the poor and the rich. For every rich man there were a thousand poor people who worked for this rich man to make him richer. He did not divide the world into Negroes or white people or Chinese--to Karl Marx it seemed that being one of the millions of poor people or one of the few rich was more important to a man than the color of his skin. The life mission of Karl Marx was to make all human beings equal and to divide the great wealth of the world so that there would be no poor or rich and each person would have his share. This is one of the commandments Karl Marx left to us: ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. '  A wrinkled, yellow palm waved timidly from the hall.",0
6429,'Were he the Mark in the Bible?'  Doctor Copeland explained. He spelled the two names and cited dates. 'Are there any more questions? I wish each one of you to feel free to start or enter into my discussion. ',0
6430,'I presume Mr. Marx was a Christian church man?' asked the preacher. 'He believed in the holiness of the human spirit.' 'Were he a white man?'  'Yes.,0
6431,"But he did not think of himself as a white man. He said, ""I consider nothing human as alien to myself. He thought of himself as a brother to all people. '",0
6432,"Doctor Copeland paused a moment longer. The faces around him were waiting. 'What is the value of any piece of property, of any merchandise we buy in a store? The value depends only on one thing--and that is the work it took to make or to raise this article. Why does a brick house cost more than a cabbage? Because the work of many men goes into the making of one brick house. There are the people who made the bricks and mortar and the people who cut down the trees to make the planks used for the floor. There are the men who made the building of the brick house possible. There are the men who carried the materials to the ground where the house was to be built. There are the men who made the wheelbarrows and trucks that carried the materials to this place. Then finally there are the workmen who built the house. A brick house involves the labor of many, many people--while any of us can raise a cabbage in his back yard. A brick house costs more than a cabbage because it takes more work to make. So when a man buys this brick house he is paying for the labor that went to make it. But who gets the money--the profit? Not the many men who did the work--but the bosses who control them. And if you study this further you will find that these bosses have bosses above them and those bosses have bosses higher up--so that the real people who control all this work, which makes any article worth money, are very few. Is this clear so far?'  'Us understand!'",0
6433,But did they? He started all over and retold what he had said. This time there were questions.,0
6434,"'But don't clay for these here bricks cost money? And don't it take money to rent land and raise crops on?' 'That is a good point,' said Doctor Copeland. 'Land, clay, timber--those things are called natural resources. Man does not make these natural resources--man only develops them, only uses them for work. Therefore should any one person or group of persons own these things? How can a man own ground and space and sunlight and rain for crops? How can a man say ""this is mine"" about those things and refuse to let others share them? Therefore Marx says that these natural resources should belong to everyone, not divided into little pieces but used by all the people according to their ability to work. It is like this. Say a man died and left his mule to his four sons. The sons would not wish to cut up the mule into four parts and each take his share. They would own and work the mule together. That is the way Marx says all of the natural resources should be owned--not by one group of rich people but by all the workers of the world as a whole.",0
6435,"'We in this room have no private properties. Perhaps one or two of us may own the homes we live in, or have a dollar or two set aside--but we own nothing that does not contribute directly toward keeping us alive. All that we own is our bodies. And we sell our bodies every day we live. We sell them when we go out in the morning to our jobs and when we labor all the day. We are forced to sell at any price, at any time, for any purpose. We are forced to sell our bodies so that we can eat and live. And the price which is given us for this is only enough so that we will have the strength to labor longer for the profits of others. Today we are not put up on the platforms and sold at the courthouse square. But we are forced to sell our strength, our time, our souls during almost every hour that we live. We have been freed from one kind of slavery only to be delivered into another. Is this freedom? Are we yet free men?'",0
6436,"A deep voice called out from the front yard. 'That the real truth!'  'That how things is!'  ' And we are not alone in this slavery. There are millions of others throughout the world, of all colors and races and creeds. This we must remember. There are many of our people who hate the poor of the white race, and they hate us. The people in this town living by the river who work in the mills. People who are almost as much in need as we are ourselves. This hatred is a great evil, and no good can ever come from it. We must remember the words of Karl Marx and see the truth according to his teachings. The injustice of need must bring us all together and not separate us. We must remember that we all make the things on this earth of value because of our labor. These main truths from Karl Marx we must keep in our hearts always and not forget.",0
6437,"'But my people! We in this room--we Negroes--have another mission that is for ourselves alone. Within us there is a strong, true purpose, and if we fail in this purpose we will be forever lost. Let us see, then, what is the nature of this special mission. '",0
6438,"Doctor Copeland loosened the collar of his shirt, for in his throat there was a choked feeling. The grievous love he felt within him was too much. He looked around him at the hushed guests. They waited. The groups of people in the yard and on the porch stood with the same quiet attention as did those in the room. A deaf old man leaned forward with his hand to his ear. A woman hushed a fretful baby with a pacifier. Mr. Singer stood attentively in the doorway. Most of the young people sat on the floor. Among them was Lancy Davis. The boy's lips were nervous and pale. He clasped his knees very tightly with his arms, and his young face was sullen. All the eyes in the room watched, and in them there was hunger for truth.",0
6439,"'Today we are to confer the five-dollar award upon the high school student who wrote the best essay on the topic, ""My Ambition: How I Can Better the Position of the Negro Race in Society. This year the award goes to Lancy Davis.' Doctor Copeland took an envelope from his pocket. 'There is no need for me to tell you that the value of this award is not wholly in the sum of money it represents--but the sacred trust and faith that goes with it. '",0
6440,"Lancy rose awkwardly to his feet. His sullen lips trembled. He bowed and accepted the award. 'Do you wish me to read the essay I have written?'  'No,' said Doctor Copeland.",0
6441,' But I wish you to come and talk with me sometime this week. ',0
6442,"'Yes, sir.' The room was quiet again. '""I do not wish to be a servant! That is the desire I have read over and over in these essays. Servants? Only one in a thousand of us is allowed to be a servant. We do not work! We do not serve!'",0
6443,"The laughter in the room was uneasy.  'Listen! One out of five of us labors to build roads, or to take care of the sanitation of this city, or works in a sawmill or on a farm. Another one out of the five is unable to get any work at all. But the other three out of this five--the greatest number of our people? Many of us cook for those who are incompetent to prepare the food that they themselves eat. Many work a lifetime tending flower gardens for the pleasure of one or two people. Many of us polish slick waxed floors of fine houses. Or we drive automobiles for rich people who are too lazy to drive themselves. We spend our lives doing thousands of jobs that are of no real use to anybody. We labor and all of our labor is wasted. Is that service? No, that is slavery.",0
6444,"'We labor, but our labor is wasted. We are not allowed to serve. You students here this morning represent the fortunate few of our race. Most of our people are not allowed to go to school at all. For each one of you there are dozens of young people who can hardly write their names. We are denied the dignity of study and wisdom.",0
6445,"'""From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. All of us here know what it is to suffer for real need. That is a great injustice. But there is one injustice bitterer even than that--to be denied the right to work according to one's ability. To labor a lifetime uselessly. To be denied the chance to serve. It is far better for the profits of our purse to be taken from us than to be robbed of the riches of our minds and souls.",0
6446,'Some of you young people here this morning may feel the need to be teachers or nurses or leaders of your race. But most of you will be denied. You will have to sell yourselves for a useless purpose in order to keep alive. You will be thrust back and defeated. The young chemist picks cotton. The young writer is unable to learn to read. The teacher is held in useless slavery at some ironing-board. We have no representatives in government. We have no vote. In all of this great country we are the most oppressed of all people. We cannot lift up our voice. Our tongues rot in our mouths from lack of use. Our hearts grow empty and lose strength for our purpose.,0
6447,'People of the Negro race! We bring with us all the riches of the human mind and soul. We offer the most precious of all gifts. And our offerings are held in scorn and contempt. Our gifts are trampled in the mud and made useless. We are put to labor more useless than the work of beasts. Negroes! We must arise and be whole again! We must be free!',0
6448,"In the room there was a murmur. Hysteria mounted. Doctor Copeland choked and clenched his fists. He felt as though he had swelled up to the size of a giant. The love in him made his chest a dynamo, and he wanted to shout so that his voice could be heard throughout the town. He wanted to fall upon the floor and call out in a giant voice. The room was full of moans and shouts.",0
6449,"'Save us!'  'Mighty Lord! Lead us from this wilderness of death!'  'Hallelujah! Save us, Lord!'",0
6450,"He struggled for the control in him. He struggled and at last the discipline returned. He pushed down the shout in him and sought for the strong, true voice.",0
6451,'Attention!' he called. 'We will save ourselves. But not by prayers of mourning. Not by indolence or strong drink. Not by the pleasures of the body or by ignorance. Not by submission and humbleness. But by pride. By dignity. By becoming hard and strong. We must build strength for our real true purpose.',0
6452,"He stopped abruptly and held himself very straight. 'Each year at this time we illustrate in our small way the first commandment from Karl Marx. Every one of you at this gathering has brought in advance some gift. Many of you have denied yourselves comfort that the needs of others may be lessened. Each of you has given according to his best ability, without thought to the value of the gift he will receive in return. It is natural for us to share with each other. We have long realized that it is more blessed to give than to receive. The words of Karl Marx have always been known in our hearts: ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. '  Doctor Copeland was silent a long time as though his words were complete.",0
6453,"Then he spoke again:  'Our mission is to walk with strength and dignity through the days of our humiliation. Our pride must be strong, for we know the value of the human mind and soul. We must teach our children. We must sacrifice so that they may earn the dignity of study and wisdom. For the time will come. The time will come when the riches in us will not be held in scorn and contempt. The time will come when we will be allowed to serve. When we will labor and our labor will not be wasted. And our mission is to await this time with strength and faith. '",0
6454,"It was finished. Hands clapped, feet were stamped upon the floor and on the hard winter ground outside. The odor of hot, strong coffee floated from the kitchen. John Roberts took charge of the presents, calling out the names written on the cards. Portia ladled the coffee from the dishpan on the stove while Marshall Nicolls passed slices of cake. Doctor Copeland moved about among the guests, a little crowd always surrounding him.",0
6455,Someone nagged at his elbow: 'He the one your Buddy named for?' He answered yes. Lancy Davis followed him with questions; he answered yes to everything. The joy made him feel like a drunken man. To teach and exhort and explain to his people--and to have them understand. That was the best of all. To speak the truth and be attended.,0
6456,"'Us certainly have had one fine time at this party.' He stood in the vestibule saying good-bye. Over and over he shook hands. He leaned heavily against the wall and only his eyes moved, for he was tired.",0
6457,'I certainly do appreciate.' Mr. Singer was the last to leave. He was a truly good man. He was a white man of intellect and true knowledge. In him there was none of the mean insolence. When all had departed he was the last to remain. He waited and seemed to expect some final word.,0
6458,"Doctor Copeland held his hand to his throat because his larynx was sore. 'Teachers,' he said huskily. 'That is our greatest need. Leaders. Someone to unite and guide us.'",0
6459,"After the festivity the rooms had a bare, ruined look. The house was cold. Portia was washing the cups in the kitchen. The silver snow on the Christmas tree had been tracked over the floors and two of the ornaments were broken.",0
6460,"He was tired, but the joy and the fever would not let him rest. Beginning with the bedroom, he set to work to put the house in order. On top of the filing case there was a loose card--the note on Lancy Davis. The words that he would say to him began to form in his mind, and he was restless because he could not speak them now. The boy's sullen face was full of heart and he could not thrust it from his thoughts. He opened the top drawer of the file to replace the card. A, B, C--he thumbed through the letters nervously. Then his eye was fixed on his own name: Copeland, Benedict Mady.",0
6461,"In the folder were several lung X-rays and a short case history. He held an X-ray up to the light. On the upper left lung there was a bright place like a calcified star. And lower down a large clouded spot that duplicated itself in the right lung farther up. Doctor Copeland quickly replaced the X-rays in the folder. Only the brief notes he had written on himself were still in his hand. The words stretched out large and scrawling so that he could hardly read them. '1920--calcif. of lymph glands--very pronounced thickening of hili. Lesions arrested--duties resumed. 1937--lesion reopened--X-ray shows----' He could not read the notes. At first he could not make out the words, and then when he read them clearly they made no reason. At the finish there were three words: 'Prognosis: Don't know. '",0
6462,"The old black, violent feeling came in him again. He leaned down and wrenched open a drawer at the bottom of the case. A jumbled pile of letters. Notes from the Association for the Advancement of Colored People. A yellowed letter from Daisy. A note from Hamilton asking for a dollar and a half. What was he looking for? His hands rummaged in the drawer and then at last he arose stiffly.",0
6463,Time wasted. The past hour gone. Portia peeled potatoes at the kitchen table. She was slumped over and her face was dolorous.,0
6464,"'Hold up your shoulders,' he said angrily. 'And cease moping. You mope and drool around until I cannot bear to look on you. '",0
6465,"'I were just thinking about Willie,' she said. 'Course the letter is only three days due. But he got no business to worry me like this. He not that kind of a boy. And I got this queer feeling. '  'Have patience, Daughter.'",0
6466,"'I reckon I have to.' 'There are a few calls I must make, but I will be back shortly. '  'O.K.'  'All will be well,' he said.",0
6467,"Most of his joy was gone in the bright, cool noonday sun. The diseases of his patients lay scattered in his mind. An abscessed kidney. Spinal meningitis. Pott's disease. He lifted the crank of the automobile from the back seat. Usually he hailed some passing Negro from the street to crank the car for him. His people were always glad to help and serve. But today he fitted the crank and turned it vigorously himself. He wiped the perspiration from his face with the sleeve of his overcoat and hurried to get beneath the wheel and on his way.",0
6468,"How much that he had said today was understood? How much would be of any value? He recalled the words he had used, and they seemed to fade and lose their strength. The words left unsaid were heavier on his heart. They rolled up to his lips and fretted them. The faces of his suffering people moved in a swelling mass before his eyes. And as he steered the automobile slowly down the street his heart turned with this angry, restless love.",0
6469,"[7] The town had not known a winter as cold as this one for years. Frost formed on the windowpanes and whitened the roofs of houses. The winter afternoons glowed with a hazy lemon light and shadows were a delicate blue. A thin coat of ice crusted the puddles in the streets, and it was said on the day after Christmas that only ten miles to the north there was a light fall of snow.",0
6470,"A change came over Singer. Often he went out for the long walks that had occupied him during the months when Antonapoulos was first gone. These walks extended for miles in every direction and covered the whole of the town. He rambled through the dense neighborhoods along the river that were more squalid than ever since the mills had been slack this winter. In many eyes there was a look of somber loneliness. Now that people were forced to be idle, a certain restlessness could be felt. There was a fervid outbreak of new beliefs. A young man who had worked at the dye vats in a mill claimed suddenly that a great holy power had come in him. He said it was his duty to deliver a new set of commandments from the Lord. The young man set up a tabernacle and hundreds of people came each night to roll on the ground and shake each other, for they believed that they were in the presence of something more than human. There was murder, too. A woman who could not make enough to eat believed that a foreman had cheated on her work tokens and she stabbed him in the throat. A family of Negroes moved into the end house on one of the most dismal streets, and this caused so much indignation that the house was burned and the black man beaten by his neighbors. But these were incidents. Nothing had really changed. The strike that was talked about never came off because they could not get together. All was the same as before. Even on the coldest nights the Sunny Dixie Show was open. The people dreamed and fought and slept as much as ever. And by habit they shortened their thoughts so that they would not wander out into the darkness beyond tomorrow.",0
6471,"Singer walked through the scattered odorous parts of town where the Negroes crowded together. There was more gaiety and violence here. Often the fine, sharp smell of gin lingered in the alleys. Warm, sleepy firelight colored the windows. Meetings were held in the churches almost every night. Comfortable little houses set off in plots of brown grass--Singer walked in these parts also. Here the children were huskier and more friendly to strangers. He roamed through the neighborhoods of the rich. There were houses, very grand and old, with white columns and intricate fences of wrought iron. He walked past the big brick houses where automobiles honked in driveways and where the plumes of smoke rolled lavishly from chimneys. And out to the very edges of the roads that led from the town to general stores where farmers came on Saturday nights and sat around the stove. He wandered often about the four main business blocks that were brightly lighted and then through the black, deserted alleys behind. There was no part of the town that Singer did not know. He watched the yellow squares of light reflect from a thousand windows. The winter nights were beautiful. The sky was a cold azure and the stars were very bright.",0
6472,"Often it happened now that he would be spoken to and stopped during these walks. All kinds of people became acquainted with him. If the person who spoke to him was a stranger, Singer presented his card so that his silence would be understood. He came to be known through all the town. He walked with his shoulders very straight and kept his hands always stuffed down into his pockets. His gray eyes seemed to take in everything around him, and in his face there was still the look of peace that is seen most often in those who are very wise or very sorrowful. He was always glad to stop with anyone who wished his company. For after all he was only walking and going nowhere.",0
6473,"Now it came about that various rumors started in the town concerning the mute. In the years before with Antonapoulos they had walked back and forth to work, but except for this they were always alone together in their rooms. No one had bothered about them then--and if they were observed it was the big Greek on whom attention was focused. The Singer of those years was forgotten.",0
6474,So the rumors about the mute were rich and varied. The Jews said that he was a Jew. The merchants along the main street claimed he had received a large legacy and was a very rich man. It was whispered in one browbeaten textile union that the mute was an organizer for the C.I.O. A lone Turk who had roamed into the town years ago and who languished with his family behind the little store where they sold linens claimed passionately to his wife that the mute was Turkish. He said that when he spoke his language the mute understood. And as he claimed this his voice grew warm and he forgot to squabble with his children and he was full of plans and activity. One old man from the country said that the mute had come from somewhere near his home and that the mute's father had the finest tobacco crop in all the county. All these things were said about him.,0
6475,"* * * * *  Antonapoulos! Within Singer there was always the memory of his friend. At night when he closed his eyes the Greek's face was there in the darkness--round and oily, with a wise and gentle smile. In his dreams they were always together.",0
6476,"It was more than a year now since his friend had gone away. This year seemed neither long nor short. Rather it was removed from the ordinary sense of time--as when one is drunk or half-asleep. Behind each hour there was always his friend. And this buried life with Antonapoulos changed and developed as did the happenings around him. During the first few months he had thought most of the terrible weeks before Antonapoulos was taken away--of the trouble that followed his illness, of the summons for arrest, and the misery in trying to control the whims of his friend. He thought of times in the past when he and Antonapoulos had been unhappy. There was one recollection, far in the past, that came back to him several times.",0
6477,They had no friends. Sometimes they would meet other mutes--there were three of them with whom they became acquainted during the ten years. But something always happened. One moved to another state the week after they met him. Another was married and had six children and did not talk with his hands. But it was their relation with the third of these acquaintances that Singer remembered when his friend was gone.,0
6478,The mute's name was Carl. He was a sallow young man who worked in one of the mills. His eyes were pale yellow and his teeth so brittle and transparent that they seemed pale yellow also. In his blue overalls that hung limp over his skinny little body he was like a blue-and-yellow rag doll.,0
6479,"They invited him to dinner and arranged to meet him beforehand at the store where Antonapoulos worked. The Greek was still busy when they arrived. He was finishing a batch of caramel fudge in the cooking room at the back of the store. The fudge lay golden and glossy over the long marble-topped table. The air was warm and rich with sweet smells. Antonapoulos seemed pleased to have Carl watch him as he glided the knife down the warm candy and cut it into squares. He offered their new friend a corner of the fudge on the edge of his greased knife, and showed him the trick that he always performed for anyone when he wished to be liked. He pointed to a vat of syrup boiling on the stove and fanned his face and squinted his eyes to show how hot it was. Then he wet his hand in a pot of cold water, plunged it into the boiling syrup, and swiftly put it back into the water again. His eyes bulged and he rolled out his tongue as though he were in great agony. He even wrung his hand and hopped on one foot so that the building shook. Then he smiled suddenly and held out his hand to show that it was a joke and hit Carl on the shoulder.",0
6480,"It was a pale winter evening, and their breath clouded in the cold air as they walked with their arms interlocked down the street. Singer was in the middle and he left them on the sidewalk twice while he went into stores to shop. Carl and Antonapoulos carried the sacks of groceries, and Singer held to their arms tightly and smiled all the way home. Their rooms were cozy and he moved happily about, making conversation with Carl. After the meal the two of them talked while Antonapoulos watched with a slow smile. Often the big Greek would lumber to the closet and pour out drinks of gin. Carl sat by the window, only drinking when Antonapoulos pushed the glass into his face, and then taking solemn little sips. Singer could not ever remember his friend so cordial to a stranger before, and he thought ahead with pleasure to the time when Carl would visit them often.",0
6481,"Midnight had passed when the thing happened that ruined the festive party. Antonapoulos returned from one of his trips to the closet and his face had a glowering look. He sat on his bed and began to stare repeatedly at their new friend with expressions of offense and great disgust. Singer tried to make eager conversation to hide this strange behavior, but the Greek was persistent. Carl huddled in a chair, nursing his bony knees, fascinated and bewildered by the grimaces of the big Greek. His face was flushed and he swallowed timidly. Singer could ignore the situation no longer, so at last he asked Antonapoulos if his stomach pained him or if he perhaps felt bad and wished to go to sleep. Antonapoulos shook his head. He pointed to Carl and began to make all the gestures of obscenity which he knew. The disgust on his face was terrible to see. Carl was small with fear. At last the big Greek ground his teeth and rose from his chair. Hurriedly Carl picked up his cap and left the room. Singer followed him down the stairs. He did not know how to explain his friend to this stranger. Carl stood hunched in the doorway downstairs, limp, with his peaked cap pulled down over his face. At last they shook hands and Carl went away.",0
6482,"Antonapoulos let him know that while they were not noticing, their guest had gone into the closet and drunk up all the gin. No amount of persuasion could convince Antonapoulos that it was he himself who had finished the bottle. The big Greek sat up in bed and his round face was dismal and reproachful. Large tears trickled slowly down to the neck of his undershirt and he could not be comforted. At last he went to sleep, but Singer was awake in the dark a long time. They never saw Carl again.",0
6483,"Then years later there was the time Antonapoulos took the rent money from the vase on the mantelpiece and spent it all on the slot machines. And the summer afternoon Antonapoulos went downstairs naked to get the paper. He suffered so from the summer heat. They bought an electric refrigerator on the installment plan, and Antonapoulos would suck the cubes of ice constantly and even let a few of them melt in the bed with him as he slept. And the time Antonapoulos got drunk and threw a bowl of macaroni in his face.",0
6484,Those ugly memories wove through his thoughts during the first months like bad threads through a carpet. And then they were gone. All the times that they had been unhappy were forgotten. For as the year went on his thoughts of his friend spiraled deeper until he dwelt only with the Antonapoulos whom he alone could know.,0
6485,"This was the friend to whom he told all that was in his heart. This was the Antonapoulos who no one knew was wise but him. As the year passed his friend seemed to grow larger in his mind, and his face looked out in a very grave and subtle way from the darkness at night. The memories of his friend changed in his mind so that he remembered nothing that was wrong or foolish--only the wise and good.",0
6486,He saw Antonapoulos sitting in a large chair before him. He sat tranquil and unmoving. His round face was inscrutable. His mouth was wise and smiling. And his eyes were profound. He watched the things that were said to him. And in his wisdom he understood.,0
6487,This was the Antonapoulos who now was always in his thoughts. This was the friend to whom he wanted to tell things that had come about. For something had happened in this year. He had been left in an alien land. Alone. He had opened his eyes and around him there was much he could not understand. He was bewildered.,0
6488,"* * * * *  He watched the words shape on their lips. We Negroes want a chance to be free at last. And freedom is only the right to contribute. We want to serve and to share, to labor and in turn consume that which is due to us. But you are the only white man I have ever encountered who realizes this terrible need of my people.",0
6489,"You see, Mister Singer? I got this music in me all the time. I got to be a real musician. Maybe I don't know anything now, but I will when I'm twenty. See, Mister Singer? And then I mean to travel in a foreign country where there's snow.",0
6490,Let's finish up the bottle. I want a small one. For we were thinking of freedom. That's the word like a worm in my brain. Yes? No? How much? How little? The word is a signal for piracy and theft and cunning. We'll be free and the smartest will then be able to enslave the others. But! But there is another meaning to the word. Of all words this one is the most dangerous. We who know must be wary. The word makes us feel good--in fact the word is a great ideal. But it's with this ideal that the spiders spin their ugliest webs for us.,0
6491,The last one rubbed his nose. He did not come often and he did not say much. He asked questions.,0
6492,"The four people had been coming to his rooms now for more than seven months. They never came together--always alone. And invariably he met them at the door with a cordial smile. The want for Antonapoulos was always with him--just as it had been the first months after his friend had gone--and it was better to be with any person than to be too long alone. It was like the time years ago when he had made a pledge to Antonapoulos (and even written it on a paper and tacked it on the wall above his bed)--a pledge that he would give up cigarettes, beer, and meat for one month. The first days had been very bad. He could not rest or be still. He visited Antonapoulos so much at the fruit store that Charles Parker was unpleasant to him. When he had finished all the engraving on hand he would dawdle around the front of the store with the watchmaker and the salesgirl or wander out to some soda fountain to drink a Coca-Cola. In those days being near any stranger was better than thinking alone about the cigarettes and beer and meat that he wanted.",0
6493,"At first he had not understood the four people at all. They talked and they talked--and as the months went on they talked more and more. He became so used to their lips that he understood each word they said. And then after a while he knew what each one of them would say before he began, because the meaning was always the same.",0
6494,* * * * *  His hands were a torment to him.,0
6495,"They would not rest. They twitched in his sleep, and sometimes he awoke to find them shaping the words in his dreams before his face. He did not like to look at his hands or to think about them. They were slender and brown and very strong. In the years before he had always tended them with care. In the winter he used oil to prevent chapping, and he kept the cuticles pushed down and his nails always filed to the shape of his fingertips. He had loved to wash and tend his hands. But now he only scrubbed them roughly with a brush two times a day and stuffed them back into his pockets.",0
6496,When he walked up and down the floor of his room he would crack the joints of his fingers and jerk at them until they ached. Or he would strike the palm of one hand with the fist of the other. And then sometimes when he was alone and his thoughts were with his friend his hands would begin to shape the words before he knew about it. Then when he realized he was like a man caught talking aloud to himself. It was almost as though he had done some moral wrong. The shame and the sorrow mixed together and he doubled his hands and put them behind him. But they would not let him rest.,0
6497,* * * * *  Singer stood in the street before the house where he and Antonapoulos had lived. The late afternoon was smoky and gray. In the west there were streaks of cold yellow and rose. A ragged winter sparrow flew in patterns against the smoky sky and at last came to light on a gable of the house. The street was deserted.,0
6498,"His eyes were fixed on a window on the right side of the second story. This was their front room, and behind was the big kitchen where Antonapoulos had cooked all of their meals. Through the lighted window he watched a woman move back and forth across the room. She was large and vague against the light and she wore an apron. A man sat with the evening newspaper in his hand. A child with a slice of bread came to the window and pressed his nose against the pane. Singer saw the room just as he had left it--with the large bed for Antonapoulos and the iron cot for himself, the big over-stuffed sofa and the camp chair. The broken sugar bowl used for an ash tray, the damp spot on the ceiling where the roof leaked, the laundry box in the corner. On late afternoons like this there would be no light in the kitchen except the glow from the oil-burners of the big stove. Antonapoulos always turned the wicks so that only a ragged fringe of gold and blue could be seen inside each burner. The room was warm and full of the good smells from the supper. Antonapoulos tasted the dishes with his wooden spoon and they drank glasses of red wine. On the linoleum rug before the stove the flames from the burners made luminous reflections--five little golden lanterns. As the milky twilight grew darker these little lanterns were more intense, so that when at last the night had come they burned with vivid purity. Supper was always ready by that time and they would turn on the light and draw their chairs to the table.",0
6499,Singer looked down at the dark front door. He thought of them going out together in the morning and coming home at night. There was the broken place in the pavement where Antonapoulos had stumbled once and hurt his elbow. There was the mailbox where their bill from the light company came each month. He could feel the warm touch of his friend's arm against his fingers.,0
6500,"The street was dark now. He looked up at the window once more and he saw the strange woman and the man and the child in a group together. The emptiness spread in him. All was gone. Antonapoulos was away; he was not here to remember. The thoughts of his friend were somewhere else. Singer shut his eyes and tried to think of the asylum and the room that Antonapoulos was in tonight. He remembered the narrow white beds and the old men playing slapjack in the corner. He held his eyes shut tight, but that room would not become clear in his mind. The emptiness was very deep inside him, and after a while he glanced up at the window once more and started down the dark sidewalk where they had walked together so many times.",0
6501,It was Saturday night. The main street was thick with people. Shivering Negroes in overalls loitered before the windows of the ten-cent store. Families stood in line before the ticket box of the movie and young boys and girls stared at the posters on display outside. The traffic from the automobiles was so dangerous that he had to wait a long time before crossing the street.,0
6502,"He passed the fruit store. The fruits were beautiful inside the windows--bananas, oranges, alligator pears, bright little kumquats, and even a few pineapples. But Charles Parker waited on a customer inside. The face of Charles Parker was very ugly to him. Several times when Charles Parker was away he had entered the store and stood around a long while. He had even gone to the kitchen in the back where Antonapoulos made the candies. But he never went into the store while Charles Parker was inside. They had both taken care to avoid each other since that day when Antonapoulos left on the bus. When they met in the street they always turned away without nodding. Once when he had wanted to send his friend a jar of his favorite tupelo honey he had ordered it from Charles Parker by mail so as not to be obliged to meet him.",0
6503,Singer stood before the window and watched the cousin of his friend wait on a group of customers. Business was always good on Saturday night. Antonapoulos sometimes had to work as late as ten o'clock. The big automatic popcorn popper was near the door. A clerk shoved in a measure of kernels and the corn whirled inside the case like giant flakes of snow. The smell from the store was warm and familiar. Peanut hulls were trampled on the floor.,0
6504,"Singer passed on down the street. He had to weave his way carefully in the crowds to keep from being jostled. The streets were strung with red and green electric lights because of the holidays. People stood in laughing groups with their arms about each other. Young fathers nursed cold and crying babies on their shoulders. A Salvation Army girl in her red-and-blue bonnet tinkled a bell on the corner, and when she looked at Singer he felt obliged to drop a coin into the pot beside her. There were beggars, both Negro and white, who held out caps or crusty hands. The neon advertisements cast an orange glow on the faces of the crowd.",0
6505,He reached the corner where he and Antonapoulos had once seen a mad dog on an August afternoon. Then he passed the room above the Army and Navy Store where Antonapoulos had had his picture taken every payday. He carried many of the photographs in his pocket now. He turned west toward the river. Once they had taken a picnic lunch and crossed the bridge and eaten in a field on the other side.,0
6506,Singer walked along the main street for about an hour. In all the crowd he seemed the only one alone. At last he took out his watch and turned toward the house where he lived. Perhaps one of the people would come this evening to his room. He hoped so.,0
6507,"* * * * *  He mailed Antonapoulos a large box of presents for Christmas. Also he presented gifts to each four of the people and to Mrs. Kelly. For all of them together he had bought a radio and put it on the table by the window. Doctor Copeland did not notice the radio. Biff Brannon noticed it immediately and raised his eyebrows. Jake Blount kept it turned on all the time he was there, at the same station, and as he talked he seemed to be shouting above the music, for the veins stood out on his forehead. Mick Kelly did not understand when she saw the radio. Her face was very red and she asked him over and over if it was really his and whether she could listen. She worked with a dial for several minutes before she got it to the place that suited her. She sat leaning forward in her chair with her hands on her knees, her mouth open and a pulse beating very fast in her temple. She seemed to listen all over to whatever it was she heard. She sat there the whole afternoon, and when she grinned at him once her eyes were wet and she rubbed them with her fists. She asked him if she could come in and listen sometimes when he was at work and he nodded yes. So for the next few days whenever he opened the door he found her by the radio. Her hand raked through her short rumpled hair and there was a look in her face he had never seen before.",0
6508,One night soon after Christmas all four of the people chanced to visit him at the same time. This had never happened before. Singer moved about the room with smiles and refreshments and did his best in the way of politeness to make his guests comfortable. But something was wrong.,0
6509,"Doctor Copeland would not sit down. He stood in the doorway, hat in hand, and only bowed coldly to the others. They looked at him as though they wondered why he was there. Jake Blount opened the beers he had brought with him and the foam spilled down on his shirtfront. Mick Kelly listened to the music from the radio. Biff Brannon sat on the bed, his knees crossed, his eyes scanning the group before him and then becoming narrow and fixed.",0
6510,Singer was bewildered. Always each of them had so much to say. Yet now that they were together they were silent. When they came in he had expected an outburst of some kind. In a vague way he had expected this to be the end of something. But in the room there was only a feeling of strain. His hands worked nervously as though they were pulling things unseen from the air and binding them together.,0
6511,Jake Blount stood beside Doctor Copeland. 'I know your face. We run into each other once before--on the steps outside. ',0
6512,"Doctor Copeland moved his tongue precisely as though he clipped out his words with scissors. 'I was not aware that we were acquainted,' he said. Then his stiff body seemed to shrink. He stepped back until he was just outside the threshold of the room.",0
6513,Biff Brannon smoked his cigarette composedly. The smoke lay in thin blue layers across the room. He turned to Mick and when he looked at her a blush reddened his face. He half-closed his eyes and in a moment his face was bloodless once more. ' And how are you getting on with your business now?'  'What business?',0
6514,"Mick asked suspiciously. 'Just the business of living,' he said. 'School--and so forth.'  'O.K., I reckon,' she said.",0
6515,Each one of them looked at Singer as though in expectation. He was puzzled. He offered refreshments and smiled.,0
6516,"Jake rubbed his lips with the palm of his hand. He left off trying to make conversation with Doctor Copeland and sat down on the bed beside Biff. 'You know who it is that used to write those bloody warnings in red chalk on the fences and walls around the mills?'  'No,' Biff said.",0
6517,'What bloody warnings?'  'Mostly from the Old Testament. I been wondering about that for a long time. ',0
6518,"Each person addressed his words mainly to the mute. Their thoughts seemed to converge in him as the spokes of a wheel lead to the center hub. 'The cold has been very unusual,' Biff said finally. 'The other day I was looking through some old records and I found that in the year 1919 the thermometer got down to ten degrees Fahrenheit. It was only sixteen degrees this morning, and that's the coldest since the big freeze that year. '",0
6519,"'There were icicles hanging off the roof of the coal house this morning,' Mick said. 'We didn't take in enough money last week to meet the payroll,' Jake said. They discussed the weather some more. Each one seemed to be waiting for the others to go. Then on an impulse they all rose to leave at the same time. Doctor Copeland went first and the others followed him immediately. When they were gone Singer stood alone in the room, and as he did not understand the situation he wanted to forget it. He decided to write to Antonapoulos that night.",0
6520,* * * * *  The fact that Antonapoulos could not read did not prevent Singer from writing to him.,0
6521,"He had always known that his friend was unable to make out the meaning of words on paper, but as the months went by he began to imagine that perhaps he had been mistaken, that perhaps Antonapoulos only kept his knowledge of letters a secret from everyone. Also, it was possible there might be a deaf-mute at the asylum who could read his letters and then explain them to his friend. He thought of several justifications for his letters, for he always felt a great need to write to his friend when he was bewildered or sad. Once written, however, these letters were never mailed. He cut out the comic strips from the morning and evening papers and sent them to his friend each Sunday. And every month he mailed a postal money order. But the long letters he wrote to Antonapoulos accumulated in his pockets until he would destroy them.",0
6522,"When the four people had gone, Singer slipped on his warm gray overcoat and his gray felt hat and left his room. He always wrote his letters at the store. Also, he had promised to deliver a certain piece of work the next morning, and he wanted to finish it now so that there would be no question of delay. The night was sharp and frosty. The moon was full and rimmed with a golden light. The rooftops were black against the starlit sky. As he walked he thought of ways to begin his letter, but he had already reached the store before the first sentence was clear in his mind. He let himself into the dark store with his key and switched on the front lights.",0
6523,"He worked at the very end of the store. A cloth curtain separated his place from the rest of the shop so that it was like a small private room. Besides his workbench and chair there was a heavy safe in the corner, a lavatory with a greenish mirror, and shelves full of boxes and worn-out clocks. Singer rolled up the top of his bench and removed from its felt case the silver platter he had promised to have ready. Although the store was cold he took off his coat and turned up the blue-striped cuffs of his shirt so that they would not get in his way.",0
6524,"For a long time he worked at the monogram in the center of the platter. With delicate, concentrated strokes he guided the scriver on the silver. As he worked his eyes had a curiously penetrating look of hunger. He was thinking of his letter to his friend Antonapoulos. Midnight had passed before the work was finished. When he put the platter away his forehead was damp with excitement. He cleared his bench and began to write. He loved to shape words with a pen on paper and he formed the letters with as much care as if the paper had been a plate of silver.",0
6525,"My Only Friend: I see from our magazine that the Society meets this year at a convention in Macon. They will have speakers and a four-course banquet. I imagine it. Remember we always planned to attend one of the conventions but we never did. I wish now that we had. I wish we were going to this one and I have imagined how it would be. But of course I could never go without you. They will come from many states and they will all be full of words and long dreams from the heart. There is also to be a special service at one of the churches and some kind of a contest with a gold medal for the prize. I write that I imagine all of this. I both do and do not. My hands have been still so long that it is difficult to remember how it is. And when I imagine the convention I think of all the guests being like you, my Friend.",0
6526,"I stood before our home the other day. Other people live in it now. Do you remember the big oak tree in front? The branches were cut back so as not to interfere with the telephone wires and the tree died. The limbs are rotten and there is a hollow place in the trunk. Also, the cat here at the store (the one you used to stroke and fondle) ate something poisonous and died. It was very sad.",0
6527,"Singer held the pen poised above the paper. He sat for a long while, erect and tense, without continuing the letter. Then he stood up and lighted himself a cigarette. The room was cold and the air had a sour stale odor--the mixed smells of kerosene and silver polish and tobacco. He put on his overcoat and muffler and began writing again with slow determination.",0
6528,"You remember the four people I told you about when I was there. I drew their pictures for you, the black man, the young girl, the one with the mustache, and the man who owns the New York Café. There are some things I should like to tell you about them but how to put them in words I am not sure.",0
6529,"They are all very busy people. In fact they are so busy that it will be hard for you to picture them. I do not mean that they work at their jobs all day and night but that they have much business in their minds always that does not let them rest. They come up to my room and talk to me until I do not understand how a person can open and shut his or her mouth so much without being weary. (However, the New York Café owner is different--he is not just like the others. He has a very black beard so that he has to shave twice daily, and he owns one of these electric razors. He watches. The others all have something they hate. And they all have something they love more than eating or sleeping or wine or friendly company. That is why they are always so busy.)",0
6530,"The one with the mustache I think is crazy. Sometimes he speaks his words very clear like my teacher long ago at the school. Other times he speaks such a language that I cannot follow. Sometimes he is dressed in a plain suit, and the next time he will be black with dirt and smelling bad and in the overalls he wears to work. He will shake his fist and say ugly drunken words that I would not wish you to know about. He thinks he and I have a secret together but I do not know what it is. And let me write you something hard to believe. He can drink three pints of Happy Days whiskey and still talk and walk on his feet and not wish for the bed. You will not believe this but it is true.",0
6531,I rent my room from the girl's mother for $16 per month. The girl used to dress in short trousers like a boy but now she wears a blue skirt and a blouse. She is not yet a young lady. I like her to come and see me. She comes all the time now that I have a radio for them. She likes music. I wish I knew what it is she hears. She knows I am deaf but she thinks I know about music.,0
6532,"The black man is sick with consumption but there is not a good hospital for him to go to here because he is black. He is a doctor and he works more than anyone I have ever seen. He does not talk like a black man at all. Other Negroes I find it hard to understand because their tongues do not move enough for the words. This black man frightens me sometimes. His eyes are hot and bright. He asked me to a party and I went. He has many books. However, he does not own any mystery books. He does not drink or eat meat or attend the movies.",0
6533,"Yah Freedom and pirates. Yah Capital and Democrats, says the ugly one with the mustache. Then he contradicts himself and says, Freedom is the greatest of all ideals. I just got to get a chance to write this music in me and be a musician. I got to have a chance, says the girl. We are not allowed to serve, says the black Doctor. That is the Godlike need of my people. Aha, says the owner of the New York Café. He is a thoughtful one.",0
6534,"That is the way they talk when they come to my room. Those words in their heart do not let them rest, so they are always very busy. Then you would think when they are together they would be like those of the Society who meet at the convention in Macon this week. But that is not so. They all came to my room at the same time today. They sat like they were from different cities. They were even rude, and you know how I have always said that to be rude and not attend to the feelings of others is wrong. So it was like that. I do not understand, so I write it to you because I think you will understand. I have queer feelings. But I have written of this matter enough and I know you are weary of it. I am also.",0
6535,It has been five months and twenty-one days now. All of that time I have been alone without you. The only thing I can imagine is when I will be with you again. If I cannot come to you soon I do not know what.,0
6536,"Singer put his head down on the bench and rested. The smell and the feel of the slick wood against his cheek reminded him of his schooldays. His eyes closed and he felt sick. There was only the face of Antonapoulos in his mind, and his longing for his friend was so sharp that he held his breath. After some time Singer sat up and reached for his pen.",0
6537,The gift I ordered for you did not come in time for the Christmas box. I expect it shortly. I believe you will like it and be amused. I think of us always and remember everything. I long for the food you used to make. At the New York Café it is much worse than it used to be. I found a cooked fly in my soup not long ago. It was mixed with the vegetables and the noodles like letters. But that is nothing. The way I need you is a loneliness I cannot bear. Soon I will come again. My vacation is not due for six months more but I think I can arrange it before then. I think I will have to. I am not meant to be alone and without you who understand.,0
6538,"Always, John Singer It was two o'clock in the morning before he was home again. The big, crowded house was in darkness, but he felt his way carefully up three flights of stairs and did not stumble. He took from his pockets the cards he carried about with him, his watch, and his fountain pen. Then he folded his clothes neatly over the back of his chair. His gray-flannel pajamas were warm and soft. Almost as soon as he pulled the blankets to his chin he was asleep.",0
6539,Out of the blackness of sleep a dream formed. There were dull yellow lanterns lighting up a dark flight of stone steps. Antonapoulos kneeled at the top of these steps. He was naked and he fumbled with something that he held above his head and gazed at it as though in prayer. He himself knelt halfway down the steps. He was naked and cold and he could not take his eyes from Antonapoulos and the thing he held above him. Behind him on the ground he felt the one with the mustache and the girl and the black man and the last one. They knelt naked and he felt their eyes on him. And behind them there were uncounted crowds of kneeling people in the darkness. His own hands were huge windmills and he stared fascinated at the unknown thing that Antonapoulos held. The yellow lanterns swayed to and fro in the darkness and all else was motionless. Then suddenly there was a ferment. In the upheaval the steps collapsed and he felt himself falling downward. He awoke with a jerk. The early light whitened the window. He felt afraid.,0
6540,Such a long time had passed that something might have happened to his friend. Because Antonapoulos did not write to him he would not know. Perhaps his friend had fallen and hurt himself. He felt such an urge to be with him once more that he would arrange it at any cost--and immediately.,0
6541,"In the post-office that morning he found a notice in his box that a package had come for him. It was the gift he had ordered for Christmas that did not arrive in time. The gift was a very fine one. He had bought it on the installment plan to be paid for over a period of two years. The gift was a moving-picture machine for private use, with a half-dozen of the Mickey Mouse and Popeye comedies that Antonapoulos enjoyed.",0
6542,"Singer was the last to reach the store that morning. He handed the jeweler for whom he worked a formal written request for leave on Friday and Saturday. And although there were four weddings on hand that week, the jeweler nodded that he could go.",0
6543,"He did not let anyone know of the trip beforehand, but on leaving he tacked a note to his door saying that he would be absent for several days because of business. He traveled at night, and the train reached the place of his destination just as the red winter dawn was breaking. * * * * *  In the afternoon, a little before time for the visiting hour, he went out to the asylum.",0
6544,"His arms were loaded with the parts of the moving-picture machine and the basket of fruit he carried his friend. He went immediately to the ward where he had visited Antonapoulos before. The corridor, the door, the rows of beds were just as he remembered them. He stood at the threshold and looked eagerly for his friend. But he saw at once that though all the chairs were occupied, Antonapoulos was not there.",0
6545,"Singer put down his packages and wrote at the bottom of one of his cards, 'Where is Spiros Antonapoulos?' A nurse came into the room and he handed her the card. She did not understand. She shook her head and raised her shoulders. He went out into the corridor and handed the card to everyone he met. Nobody knew. There was such a panic in him that he began motioning with his hands. At last he met an interne in a white coat. He plucked at the interne's elbow and gave him the card. The interne read it carefully and then guided him through several halls. They came to a small room where a young woman sat at a desk before some papers. She read the card and then looked through some files in a drawer.",0
6546,"Tears of nervousness and fear swam in Singer's eyes. The young woman began deliberately to write on a pad of paper, and he could not restrain himself from twisting around to see immediately what was being written about his friend. Mr. Antonapoulos has been transferred to the infirmary. He is ill with nephritis. I will have someone show you the way.",0
6547,"On the way through the corridors he stopped to pick up the packages he had left at the door of the ward. The basket of fruit had been stolen, but the other boxes were intact. He followed the interne out of the building and across a plot of grass to the infirmary.",0
6548,"Antonapoulos! When they reached the proper ward he saw him at the first glance. His bed was placed in the middle of the room and he was sitting propped with pillows. He wore a scarlet dressing-gown and green silk pajamas and a turquoise ring. His skin was a pale yellow color, his eyes very dreamy and dark. His black hair was touched at the temples with silver. He was knitting. His fat fingers worked with the long ivory needles very slowly. At first he did not see his friend. Then when Singer stood before him he smiled serenely, without surprise, and held out his jeweled hand.",0
6549,"A feeling of shyness and restraint such as he had never known before came over Singer. He sat down by the bed and folded his hands on the edge of the counterpane. His eyes did not leave the face of his friend and he was deathly pale. The splendor of his friend's raiment startled him. On various occasions he had sent him each article of the outfit, but he had not imagined how they would look when all combined. Antonapoulos was more enormous than he had remembered. The great pulpy folds of his abdomen showed beneath his silk pajamas. His head was immense against the white pillow. The placid composure of his face was so profound that he seemed hardly to be aware that Singer was with him.",0
6550,"Singer raised his hands timidly and began to speak. His strong, skilled fingers shaped the signs with loving precision. He spoke of the cold and of the long months alone. He mentioned old memories, the cat that had died, the store, the place where he lived. At each pause Antonapoulos nodded graciously. He spoke of the four people and the long visits to his room. The eyes of his friend were moist and dark, and in them he saw the little rectangled pictures of himself that he had watched a thousand times. The warm blood flowed back to his face and his hands quickened. He spoke at length of the black man and the one with the jerking mustache and the girl. The designs of his hands shaped faster and faster. Antonapoulos nodded with slow gravity. Eagerly Singer leaned closer and he breathed with long, deep breaths and in his eyes there were bright tears.",0
6551,"Then suddenly Antonapoulos made a slow circle in the air with his plump forefinger. His finger circled toward Singer and at last he poked his friend in the stomach. The big Greek's smile grew very broad and he stuck out his fat, pink tongue. Singer laughed and his hands shaped the words with wild speed. His shoulders shook with laughter and his head hung backward. Why he laughed he did not know. Antonapoulos rolled his eyes. Singer continued to laugh riotously until his breath was gone and his fingers trembled. He grasped the arm of his friend and tried to steady himself. His laughs came low and painfully like hiccoughs.",0
6552,"Antonapoulos was the first to compose himself. His fat little feet had untucked the cover at the bottom of the bed. His smile faded and he kicked contemptuously at the blanket. Singer hastened to put things right, but Antonapoulos frowned and held up his finger regally to a nurse who was passing through the ward. When she had straightened the bed to his liking the big Greek inclined his head so deliberately that the gesture seemed one of benediction rather than a simple nod of thanks. Then he turned gravely to his friend again.",0
6553,"As Singer talked he did not realize how the time had passed. Only when a nurse brought Antonapoulos his supper on a tray did he realize that it was late. The lights in the ward were turned on and outside the windows it was almost dark. The other patients had trays of supper before them also. They had put down their work (some of them wove baskets, others did leatherwork or knitted) and they were eating listlessly. Beside Antonapoulos they all seemed very sick and colorless. Most of them needed a haircut and they wore seedy gray nightshirts slit down the back. They stared at the two mutes with wonder.",0
6554,"Antonapoulos lifted the cover from his dish and inspected the food carefully. There was fish and some vegetables. He picked up the fish and held it to the light in the palm of his hand for a thorough examination. Then he ate with relish. During supper he began to point out the various people in the room. He pointed to one man in the corner and made faces of disgust. The man snarled at him. He pointed to a young boy and smiled and nodded and waved his plump hand. Singer was too happy to feel embarrassment. He picked up the packages from the floor and laid them on the bed to distract his friend. Antonapoulos took off the wrappings, but the machine did not interest him at all. He turned back to his supper.",0
6555,Singer handed the nurse a note explaining about the movie. She called an interne and then they brought in a doctor. As the three of them consulted they looked curiously at Singer. The news reached the patients and they propped up on their elbows excitedly. Only Antonapoulos was not disturbed.,0
6556,Singer had practiced with the movie beforehand. He set up the screen so that it could be watched by all the patients. Then he worked with the projector and the film. The nurse took out the supper trays and the lights in the ward were turned off. A Mickey Mouse comedy flashed on the screen.,0
6557,Singer watched his friend. At first Antonapoulos was startled. He heaved himself up for a better view and would have risen from the bed if the nurse had not restrained him. Then he watched with a beaming smile. Singer could see the other patients calling out to each other and laughing. Nurses and orderlies came in from the hall and the whole ward was in commotion. When the Mickey Mouse was finished Singer put on a Popeye film. Then at the conclusion of this film he felt that the entertainment had lasted long enough for the first time. He switched on the light and the ward settled down again. As the interne put the machine under his friend's bed he saw Antonapoulos slyly cut his eyes across the ward to be certain that each person realized that the machine was his.,0
6558,"Singer began to talk with his hands again. He knew that he would soon be asked to leave, but the thoughts he had stored in his mind were too big to be said in a short time. He talked with frantic haste. In the ward there was an old man whose head shook with palsy and who picked feebly at his eyebrows. He envied the old man because he lived with Antonapoulos day after day. Singer would have exchanged places with him joyfully.",0
6559,"His friend fumbled for something in his bosom. It was the little brass cross that he had always worn. The dirty string had been replaced by a red ribbon. Singer thought of the dream and he told that, also, to his friend. In his haste the signs sometimes became blurred and he had to shake his hands and begin all over. Antonapoulos watched him with his dark, drowsy eyes. Sitting motionless in his bright, rich garments he seemed like some wise king from a legend.",0
6560,"The interne in charge of the ward allowed Singer to stay for an hour past the visiting time. Then at last he held out his thin, hairy wrist and showed him his watch. The patients were settled for sleep. Singer's hand faltered. He grasped his friend by the arm and looked intently into his eyes as he used to do each morning when they parted for work. Finally Singer backed himself out of the room. At the doorway his hands signed a broken farewell and then clenched into fists.",0
6561,* * * * *  During the moonlit January nights Singer continued to walk about the streets of the town each evening when he was not engaged. The rumors about him grew bolder. An old Negro woman told hundreds of people that he knew the ways of spirits come back from the dead. A certain pieceworker claimed that he had worked with the mute at another mill somewhere else in the state--and the tales he told were unique. The rich thought that he was rich and the poor considered him a poor man like themselves. And as there was no way to disprove these rumors they grew marvelous and very real. Each man described the mute as he wished him to be.,0
6562,"[8] Why? The question flowed through Biff always, unnoticed, like the blood in his veins. He thought of people and of objects and of ideas and the question was in him. Midnight, the dark morning, noon. Hitler and the rumors of war. The price of loin of pork and the tax on beer. Especially he meditated on the puzzle of the mute. Why, for instance, did Singer go away on the train and, when he was asked where he had been, pretend that he did not understand the question? And why did everyone persist in thinking the mute was exactly as they wanted him to be--when most likely it was all a very queer mistake? Singer sat at the middle table three times a day. He ate what was put before him--except cabbage and oysters. In the battling tumult of voices he alone was silent. He liked best little green soft butter beans and he stacked them in a neat pile on the prongs of his fork. And sopped their gravy with his biscuits.",0
6563,Biff thought also of death. A curious incident occurred. One day while rummaging through the bathroom closet he found a bottle of Agua Florida that he had overlooked when taking Lucile the rest of Alice's cosmetics. Meditatively he held the bottle of perfume in his hands. It was four months now since her death--and each month seemed as long and full of leisure as a year. He seldom thought of her.,0
6564,"Biff uncorked the bottle. He stood shirtless before the mirror and dabbed some of the perfume on his dark, hairy armpits. The scent made him stiffen. He exchanged a deadly secret glance with himself in the mirror and stood motionless. He was stunned by the memories brought to him with the perfume, not because of their clarity, but because they gathered together the whole long span of years and were complete. Biff rubbed his nose and looked sideways at himself. The boundary of death. He felt in him each minute that he had lived with her. And now their life together was whole as only the past can be whole. Abruptly Biff turned away.",0
6565,"The bedroom was done over. His entirely now. Before it had been tacky and flossy and drab. There were always stockings and pink rayon knickers with holes in them hung on a string across the room to dry. The iron bed had been flaked and rusty, decked with soiled lace boudoir pillows. A bony mouser from downstairs would arch its back and rub mournfully against the slop jar.",0
6566,"All of this he had changed. He traded the iron bed for a studio couch. There was a thick red rug on the floor, and he had bought a beautiful cloth of Chinese blue to hang on the side of the wall where the cracks were worst. He had unsealed the fireplace and kept it laid with pine logs. Over the mantel was a small photograph of Baby and a colored picture of a little boy in velvet holding a ball in his hands. A glassed case in the corner held the curios he had collected--specimens of butterflies, a rare arrowhead, a curious rock shaped like a human profile. Blue-silk cushions were on the studio couch, and he had borrowed Lucile's sewing-machine to make deep red curtains for the windows. He loved the room. It was both luxurious and sedate. On the table there was a little Japanese pagoda with glass pendants that tinkled with strange musical tones in a draught.",0
6567,"In this room nothing reminded him of her. But often he would uncork the bottle of Agua Florida and touch the stopper to the lobes of his ears or to his wrists. The smell mingled with his slow ruminations. The sense of the past grew in him. Memories built themselves with almost architectural order. In a box where he stored souvenirs he came across old pictures taken before their marriage. Alice sitting in a field of daisies. Alice with him in a canoe on the river. Also among the souvenirs there was a large bone hairpin that had belonged to his mother. As a little boy he had loved to watch her comb and knot her long black hair. He had thought that hairpins were curved as they were to copy the shape of a lady and he would sometimes play with them like dolls. At that time he had a cigar box full of scraps. He loved the feel and colors of beautiful cloth and he would sit with his scraps for hours under the kitchen table. But when he was six his mother took the scraps away from him. She was a tall, strong woman with a sense of duty like a man. She had loved him best. Even now he sometimes dreamed of her. And her worn gold wedding ring stayed on his finger always.",0
6568,"Along with the Agua Florida he found in the closet a bottle of lemon rinse Alice had always used for her hair. One day he tried it on himself. The lemon made his dark, white-streaked hair seem fluffy and thick. He liked it. He discarded the oil he had used to guard against baldness and rinsed with the lemon preparation regularly. Certain whims that he had ridiculed in Alice were now his own. Why?",0
6569,"Every morning Louis, the colored boy downstairs, brought him a cup of coffee to drink in bed. Often he sat propped on the pillows for an hour before he got up and dressed. He smoked a cigar and watched the patterns the sunlight made on the wall. Deep in meditation he ran his forefinger between his long, crooked toes. He remembered.",0
6570,Then from noon until five in the morning he worked downstairs. And all day Sunday. The business was losing money. There were many slack hours. Still at meal-times the place was usually full and he saw hundreds of acquaintances every day as he stood guard behind the cash register.,0
6571,'What do you stand and think about all the time?' Jake Blount asked him. 'You look like a Jew in Germany. ',0
6572,"'I am an eighth part Jew,' Biff said. ' My Mother's grandfather was a Jew from Amsterdam. But all the rest of my folks that I know about were Scotch-Irish.'",0
6573,"It was Sunday morning. Customers lolled at the tables and there were the smell of tobacco and the rustle of newspaper. Some men in a corner booth shot dice, but the game was a quiet one.",0
6574,'Where's Singer?' Biff asked. 'Won't you be going up to his place this morning? ',0
6575,"Blount's face turned dark and sullen. He jerked his head forward. Had they quarreled--but how could a dummy quarrel? No, for this had happened before. Blount hung around sometimes and acted as though he were having an argument with himself. But pretty soon he would go--he always did--and the two of them would come in together, Blount talking.",0
6576,'You live a fine life. Just standing behind a cash register. Just standing with your hand open.',0
6577,Biff did not take offense. He leaned his weight on his elbows and narrowed his eyes. 'Let's me and you have a serious talk. What is it you want anyway?',0
6578,Blount smacked his hands down on the counter. They were warm and meaty and rough. 'Beer. And one of them little packages of cheese crackers with peanut butter in the inside. ',0
6579,"'That's not what I meant,' Biff said. ' But we'll come around to it later. '",0
6580,"The man was a puzzle. He was always changing. He still drank like a crazy fish, but liquor did not drag him down as it did some men. The rims of his eyes were often red, and he had a nervous trick of looking back startled over his shoulder. His head was heavy and huge on his thin neck. He was the sort of fellow that kids laughed at and dogs wanted to bite. Yet when he was laughed at it cut him to the quick--he got rough and loud like a sort of clown. And he was always suspecting that somebody was laughing.",0
6581,"Biff shook his head thoughtfully. 'Come,' he said. 'What makes you stick with that show? You can find something better than that. I could even give you a part-time job here. '  'Christamighty!",0
6582,"I wouldn't park myself behind that cash box if you was to give me the whole damn place, lock, stock, and barrel. ' There he was. It was irritating. He could never have friends or even get along with people.",0
6583,"'Talk sense,' Biff said. 'Be serious. '",0
6584,"A customer had come up with his check and he made change. The place was still quiet. Blount was restless. Biff felt him drawing away. He wanted to hold him. He reached for two A-1 cigars on the shelf behind the counter and offered Blount a smoke. Warily his mind dismissed one question after another, and then finally he asked:  'If you could choose the time in history you could have lived, what era would you choose?'",0
6585,"Blount licked his mustache with his broad, wet tongue. 'If you had to choose between being a stiff and never asking another question, which would you take?'  'Sure enough,' Biff insisted. 'Think it over.'",0
6586,He cocked his head to one side and peered down over his long nose. This was a matter he liked to hear others talk about. Ancient Greece was his. Walking in sandals on the edge of the blue Aegean. The loose robes girdled at the waist. Children. The marble baths and the contemplations in the temples.,0
6587,"'Maybe with the Incas. In Peru.'  Biff's eyes scanned over him, stripping him naked. He saw Blount burned a rich, red brown by the sun, his face smooth and hairless, with a bracelet of gold and precious stones on his forearm. When he closed his eyes the man was a good Inca. But when he looked at him again the picture fell away. It was the nervous mustache that did not belong to his face, the way he jerked his shoulder, the Adam's apple on his thin neck, the bagginess of his trousers. And it was more than that.",0
6588,"'Or maybe around 1775. ' 'That was a good time to be living,' Biff agreed.",0
6589,Blount shuffled his feet self-consciously. His face was rough and unhappy. He was ready to leave. Biff was alert to detain him. 'Tell me--why did you ever come to this town anyway?' He knew immediately that the question had not been a politic one and he was disappointed with himself. Yet it was queer how the man could land up in a place like this.,0
6590,"'It's the God's truth I don't know. ' They stood quietly for a moment, both leaning on the counter. The game of dice in the corner was finished. The first dinner order, a Long Island duck special, had been served to the fellow who managed the A. and P. store. The radio was turned halfway between a church sermon and a swing band.",0
6591,"Blount leaned over suddenly and smelled in Biff's face. 'Perfume?'  'Shaving lotion,' Biff said composedly. He could not keep Blount longer. The fellow was ready to go. He would come in with Singer later. It was always like this. He wanted to draw Blount out completely so that he could understand certain questions concerning him. But Blount would never really talk--only to the mute. It was a most peculiar thing.",0
6592,"'Thanks for the cigar,' Blount said. 'See you later. '  'So long.'",0
6593,"Biff watched Blount walk to the door with his rolling, sailor-like gait. Then he took up the duties before him. He looked over the display in the window. The day's menu had been pasted on the glass and a special dinner with all the trimmings was laid out to attract customers. It looked bad. Right nasty. The gravy from the duck had run into the cranberry sauce and a fly was stuck in the dessert.",0
6594,"'Hey, Louis!' he called. 'Take this stuff out the window. And bring me that red pottery bowl and some fruit.'",0
6595,"He arranged the fruits with an eye for color and design. At last the decoration pleased him. He visited the kitchen and had a talk with the cook. He lifted the lids of the pots and sniffed the food inside, but without heart for the matter. Alice always had done this part. He disliked it. His nose sharpened when he saw the greasy sink with its scum of food bits at the bottom. He wrote down the menus and the orders for the next day. He was glad to leave the kitchen and take his stand by the cash register again.",0
6596,Lucile and Baby came for Sunday dinner. The little kid was not so good now. The bandage was still on her head and the doctor said it could not come off until next month. The binding of gauze in place of the yellow curls made her head look naked.,0
6597,"'Say hello to Uncle Biff, Hon,' Lucile prompted. Baby bridled fretfully. 'Hello to Unca Biff Hon,' she sassed.",0
6598,"She put up a struggle when Lucile tried to take off her Sunday coat. 'Now you just behave yourself,' Lucile kept saying. 'You got to take it off or you'll catch pneumonia when we go out again. Now you just behave yourself. '",0
6599,"Biff took the situation in charge. He soothed Baby with a ball of candy gum and eased the coat from her shoulders. Her dress had lost its set in the struggle with Lucile. He straightened it so that the yoke was in line across her chest. He retied her sash and crushed the bow to just the right shape with his fingers. Then he patted Baby on her little behind. 'We got some strawberry ice cream today,' he said.",0
6600,"'Bartholomew, you'd make a mighty good mother.' 'Thanks,' Biff said. 'That's a compliment. '",0
6601,"'We just been to Sunday School and church. Baby, say the verse from the Bible you learned for your Uncle Biff.' The kid hung back and pouted. 'Jesus wept,' she said finally. The scorn that she put in the two words made it sound like a terrible thing.",0
6602,'Want to see Louis?' Biff asked. 'He's back in the kitchen. ',0
6603,'I wanna see Willie. I wanna hear Willie play the harp. ',0
6604,"'Now, Baby, you're just trying yourself,' Lucile said impatiently. 'You know good and well that Willie's not here. Willie was sent off to the penitentiary.'",0
6605,"'But Louis,' Biff said. 'He can play the harp, too. Go tell him to get the ice cream ready and play you a tune. '",0
6606,"Baby went toward the kitchen, dragging one heel on the floor. Lucile laid her hat on the counter. There were tears in her eyes. 'You know I always said this: If a child is kept clean and well cared for and pretty then that child will usually be sweet and smart. But if a child's dirty and ugly then you can't expect anything much. What I'm trying to get at is that Baby is so shamed over losing her hair and that bandage on her head that it just seems like it makes her cut the buck all the time. She won't practice her elocution--she won't do a thing. She feels so bad I just can't manage her. '",0
6607,"'If you'd quit picking with her so much she'd be all right. ' At last he settled them in a booth by the window. Lucile had a special and there was a breast of chicken cut up fine, cream of wheat, and carrots for Baby. She played with her food and spilled milk on her little frock. He sat with them until the rush started. Then he had to be on his feet to keep things going smoothly.",0
6608,People eating. The wide-open mouths with the food pushed in. What was it? The line he had read not long ago. Life was only a matter of intake and alimentation and reproduction. The place was crowded. There was a swing band on the radio.,0
6609,"Then the two he was waiting for came in. Singer entered the door first, very straight and swank in his tailored Sunday suit. Blount followed along just behind his elbow. There was something about the way they walked that struck him. They sat at their table, and Blount talked and ate with gusto while Singer watched politely. When the meal was finished they stopped by the cash register for a few minutes. Then as they went out he noticed again there was something about their walking together that made him pause and question himself. What could it be? The suddenness with which the memory opened up deep down in his mind was a shock. The big deaf-mute moron whom Singer used to walk with sometimes on the way to work. The sloppy Greek who made candy for Charles Parker. The Greek always walked ahead and Singer followed. He had never noticed them much because they never came into the place. But why had he not remembered this? Of all times he had wondered about the mute to neglect such an angle. See everything in the landscape except the three waltzing elephants. But did it matter after all?",0
6610,Biff narrowed his eyes. How Singer had been before was not important. The thing that mattered was the way Blount and Mick made of him a sort of home-made God. Owing to the fact he was a mute they were able to give him all the qualities they wanted him to have. Yes. But how could such a strange thing come about? And why?  A one-armed man came in and Biff treated him to a whiskey on the house.,0
6611,But he did not feel like talking to anyone. Sunday dinner was a family meal. Men who drank beer by themselves on weeknights brought their wives and little kids with them on Sunday. The high-chair they kept in the back was often needed. It was two-thirty and though many tables were occupied the meal was almost over. Biff had been on his feet for the past four hours and was tired. He used to stand for fourteen or sixteen hours and not notice any effects at all. But now he had aged. Considerably. There was no doubt about it. Or maybe matured was the word. Not aged--certainly not--yet. The waves of sound in the room swelled and subsided against his ears. Matured. His eyes smarted and it was as though some fever in him made everything too bright and sharp.,0
6612,"He called to one of the waitresses: 'Take over for me will you, please? I'm going out.' The street was empty because of Sunday. The sun shone bright and clear, without warmth. Biff held the collar of his coat closed to his neck. Alone in the street he felt out of pocket. The wind blew cold from the river. He should turn back and stay in the restaurant where he belonged. He had no business going to the place where he was headed. For the past four Sundays he had done this. He had walked in the neighborhood where he might see Mick. And there was something about it that was--not quite right. Yes. Wrong.",0
6613,"He walked slowly down the sidewalk opposite the house where she lived. Last Sunday she had been reading the funny papers on the front steps. But this time as he glanced swiftly toward the house he saw she was not there. Biff tilted the brim of his felt hat down over his eyes. Perhaps she would come into the place later. Often on Sunday after supper she came for a hot cocoa and stopped for a while at the table where Singer was sitting. On Sunday she wore a different outfit from the blue skirt and sweater she wore on other days. Her Sunday dress was wine-colored silk with a dingy lace collar. Once she had had on stockings--with runs in them. Always he wanted to set her up to something, to give to her. And not only a sundae or some sweet to eat--but something real. That was all he wanted for himself--to give to her. Biff's mouth hardened. He had done nothing wrong but in him he felt a strange guilt. Why? The dark guilt in all men, unreckoned and without a name.",0
6614,"On the way home Biff found a penny lying half-concealed by rubbish in the gutter. Thriftily he picked it up, cleaned the coin with his handkerchief, and dropped it into the black pocket purse he carried. It was four o'clock when he reached the restaurant. Business was stagnant. There was not a single customer in the place.",0
6615,"Business picked up around five. The boy he had recently hired to work part-time showed up early. The boy's name was Harry Minowitz. He lived in the same neighborhood with Mick and Baby. Eleven applicants had answered the ad in the paper, but Harry seemed to be best bet. He was well developed for his age, and neat. Biff had noticed the boy's teeth while talking to him during the interview. Teeth were always a good indication. His were large and very clean and white. Harry wore glasses, but that would not matter in the work. His mother made ten dollars a week sewing for a tailor down the street, and Harry was an only child.",0
6616,"'Well,' Biff said. 'You've been with me a week, Harry. Think you're going to like it?'  'Sure, sir.",0
6617,"Sure I like it.' Biff turned the ring on his finger. 'Let's see. What time do you get off from school? '  'Three o'clock, sir.'",0
6618,"'Well, that gives you a couple of hours for study and recreation. Then here from six to ten. Does that leave you enough time for plenty of sleep. '",0
6619,'Plenty. I don't need near that much. ',0
6620,"'You need about nine and a half hours at your age, son. Pure, wholesome sleep. '",0
6621,He felt suddenly embarrassed. Maybe Harry would think it was none of his business. Which it wasn't anyway. He started to turn aside and then thought of something.,0
6622,"'You go to Vocational?'  Harry nodded and rubbed his glasses on his shirt-sleeve. 'Let's see. I know a lot of girls and boys there. Alva Richards--I know his father. And Maggie Henry. And a kid named Mick Kelly----' He felt as though his ears had caught afire. He knew himself to be a fool. He wanted to turn and walk away and yet he only stood there, smiling and mashing his nose with his thumb. 'You know her?' he asked faintly.",0
6623,"'Sure, I live right next door to her. But in school I'm a senior while she's a freshman.' Biff stored this meager information neatly in his mind to be thought over later when he was alone. 'Business will be quiet here for a while,' he said hurriedly. 'I'll leave it with you. By now you know how to handle things. Just watch any customers drinking beer and remember how many they've drunk so you won't have to ask them and depend on what they say. Take your time making change and keep track of what goes on.'",0
6624,"Biff shut himself in his room downstairs. This was the place where he kept his files. The room had only one small window that looked out on the side alley, and the air was musty and cold. Huge stacks of newspapers rose up to the ceiling. A home-made filing case covered one wall. Near the door there was an old-fashioned rocking-chair and a small table laid with a pair of shears, a dictionary, and a mandolin. Because of the piles of newspaper it was impossible to take more than two steps in any direction. Biff rocked himself in the chair and languidly plucked the strings of the mandolin. His eyes closed and he began to sing in a doleful voice:  I went to the animal fair.",0
6625,"The birds and the beasts were there, And the old baboon by the light of the moon Was combing his auburn hair. He finished with a chord from the strings and the last sounds shivered to silence in the cold air. To adopt a couple of little children. A boy and a girl. About three or four years old so they would always feel like he was their own father. Their Dad. Our Father. The little girl like Mick (or Baby?) at that age. Round cheeks and gray eyes and flaxen hair. And the clothes he would make for her--pink crêpe de Chine frocks with dainty smocking at the yoke and sleeves. Silk socks and white buckskin shoes. And a little red-velvet coat and cap and muff for winter. The boy was dark and black-haired. The little boy walked behind him and copied the things he did. In the summer the three of them would go to a cottage on the Gulf and he would dress the children in their sun suits and guide them carefully into the green, shallow waves. And then they would bloom as he grew old. Our Father. And they would come to him with questions and he would answer them.",0
6626,"Why not? Biff took up his mandolin again. 'Tum-ti-tim-ti-tee, ti-tee, the wedding of the painted doll.' The mandolin mocked the refrain. He sang through all the verses and wagged his foot to the time. Then he played 'K-K-K-Katie,' and 'Love's Old Sweet Song.' These pieces were like the Agua Florida in the way they made him remember. Everything. Through the first year when he was happy and when she seemed happy even too. And when the bed came down with them twice in three months. And he didn't know that all the time her brain was busy with how she could save a nickel or squeeze out an extra dime. And then him with Rio and the girls at her place. Gyp and Madeline and Lou. And then later when suddenly he lost it. When he could lie with a woman no longer. Motherogod! So that at first it seemed everything was gone.",0
6627,"Lucile always understood the whole set-up. She knew the kind of woman Alice was. Maybe she knew about him, too. Lucile would urge them to get a divorce. And she did all a person could to try to straighten out their messes.",0
6628,"Biff winced suddenly. He jerked his hands from the strings of the mandolin so that a phrase of music was chopped off. He sat tense in his chair. Then suddenly he laughed quietly to himself. What had made him come across this? Ah, Lordy Lordy Lord! It was the day of his twenty-ninth birthday, and Lucile had asked him to drop by her apartment when he finished with an appointment at the dentist's. He expected from this some little remembrance--a plate of cherry tarts or a good shirt. She met him at the door and blindfolded his eyes before he entered. Then she said she would be back in a second. In the silent room he listened to her footsteps and when she had reached the kitchen he broke wind. He stood in the room with his eyes blindfolded and pooted. Then all at once he knew with horror he was not alone. There was a titter and soon great rolling whoops of laughter deafened him. At that minute Lucile came back and undid his eyes. She held a caramel cake on a platter. The room was full of people. Leroy and that bunch and Alice, of course. He wanted to crawl up the wall. He stood there with his bare face hanging out, burning hot all over. They kidded him and the next hour was almost as bad as the death of his mother--the way he took it. Later that night he drank a quart of whiskey. And for weeks after----Motherogod!",0
6629,Biff chuckled coldly. He plucked a few chords on his mandolin and started a rollicking cowboy song. His voice was a mellow tenor and he closed his eyes as he sang. The room was almost dark. The damp chill penetrated to his bones so that his legs ached with rheumatism.,0
6630,At last he put away his mandolin and rocked slowly in the darkness. Death. Sometimes he could almost feel it in the room with him. He rocked to and fro in the chair. What did he understand? Nothing. Where was he headed? Nowhere. What did he want? To know. What? A meaning. Why? A riddle.,0
6631,Broken pictures lay like a scattered jigsaw puzzle in his head. Alice soaping in the bathtub. Mussolini's mug. Mick pulling the baby in a wagon. A roast turkey on display. Blount's mouth. The face of Singer. He felt himself waiting. The room was completely dark. From the kitchen he could hear Louis singing.,0
6632,"Biff stood up and touched the arm of the chair to still its rocking. When he opened the door the hall outside was very warm and bright. He remembered that perhaps Mick would come. He straightened his clothes and smoothed back his hair. A warmth and liveliness returned to him. The restaurant was in a hubbub. Beer rounds and Sunday supper had begun. He smiled genially to young Harry and settled himself behind the cash register. He took in the room with a glance like a lasso. The place was crowded and humming with noise. The bowl of fruit in the window was a genteel, artistic display. He watched the door and continued to examine the room with a practiced eye. He was alert and intently waiting. Singer came finally and wrote with his silver pencil that he wanted only soup and whiskey as he had a cold. But Mick did not come.",0
6633,"[9] She never even had a nickel to herself any more. They were that poor. Money was the main thing. All the time it was money, money, money. They had to pay through the nose for Baby Wilson's private room and private nurse. But even that was just one bill. By the time one thing was paid for something else always would crop up. They owed around two hundred dollars that had to be paid right away. They lost the house. Their Dad got a hundred dollars out of the deal and let the bank take over the mortgage. Then he borrowed another fifty dollars and Mister Singer went on the note with him. Afterward they had to worry about rent every month instead of taxes. They were mighty near as poor as factory folks. Only nobody could look down on them.",0
6634,"Bill had a job in a bottling plant and made ten dollars a week. Hazel worked as a helper in a beauty parlor for eight dollars. Etta sold tickets at a movie for five dollars. Each of them paid half of what they earned for their keep. Then the house had six boarders at five dollars a head. And Mister Singer, who paid his rent very prompt. With what their Dad picked up it all came to about two hundred dollars a month--and out of that they had to feed the six boarders pretty good and feed the family and pay rent for the whole house and keep up the payments on the furniture.",0
6635,George and her didn't get any lunch money now. She had to stop the music lessons. Portia saved the leftovers from the dinner for her and George to eat after school. All the time they had their meals in the kitchen. Whether Bill and Hazel and Etta sat with the boarders or ate in the kitchen depended on how much food there was. In the kitchen they had grits and grease and side meat and coffee for breakfast. For supper they had the same thing along with whatever could be spared from the dining-room. The big kids griped whenever they had to eat in the kitchen. And sometimes she and George were downright hungry for two or three days.,0
6636,"But this was in the outside room. It had nothing to do with music and foreign countries and the plans she made. The winter was cold. Frost was on the windowpanes. At night the fire in the living-room crackled very warm. All the family sat by the fire with the boarders, so she had the middle bedroom to herself. She wore two sweaters and a pair of Bill's outgrown corduroy pants. Excitement kept her warm. She would bring out her private box from under the bed and sit on the floor to work.",0
6637,"In the big box there were the pictures she had painted at the government free art class. She had taken them out of Bill's room. Also in the box she kept three mystery books her Dad had given her, a compact, a box of watch parts, a rhinestone necklace, a hammer, and some notebooks. One notebook was marked on the top with red crayon--PRIVATE. KEEP OUT. PRIVATE--and tied with a string.",0
6638,She had worked on music in this notebook all the winter. She quit studying school lessons at night so she could have more time to spend on music. Mostly she had written just little tunes--songs without any words and without even any bass notes to them. They were very short. But even if the tunes were only half a page long she gave them names and drew her initials underneath them. Nothing in this book was a real piece or a composition. They were just songs in her mind she wanted to remember. She named them how they reminded her--'Africa' and 'A Big Fight' and 'The Snowstorm.',0
6639,She couldn't write the music just like it sounded in her mind. She had to thin it down to only a few notes; otherwise she got too mixed up to go further. There was so much she didn't know about how to write music. But maybe after she learned how to write these simple tunes fairly quick she could begin to put down the whole music in her mind.,0
6640,"In January she began a certain very wonderful piece called 'This Thing I Want, I Know Not What.' It was a beautiful and marvelous song--very slow and soft. At first she had started to write a poem along with it, but she couldn't think of ideas to fit the music. Also it was hard to get a word for the third line to rhyme with what. This new song made her feel sad and excited and happy all at once. Music beautiful as this was hard to work on. Any song was hard to write. Something she could hum in two minutes meant a whole week's work before it was down in the notebook--after she had figured up the scale and the time and every note.",0
6641,"She had to concentrate hard and sing it many times. Her voice was always hoarse. Her Dad said this was because she had bawled so much when she was a baby. Her Dad would have to get up and walk with her every night when she was Ralph's age. The only thing would hush her, he always said, was for him to beat the coal scuttle with a poker and sing 'Dixie.'",0
6642,"She lay on her stomach on the cold floor and thought. Later on--when she was twenty--she would be a great world-famous composer. She would have a whole symphony orchestra and conduct all of her music herself. She would stand up on the platform in front of the big crowds of people. To conduct the orchestra she would wear either a real man's evening suit or else a red dress spangled with rhinestones. The curtains of the stage would be red velvet and M.K. would be printed on them in gold. Mister Singer would be there, and afterward they would go out and eat fried chicken. He would admire her and count her as his very best friend. George would bring up big wreaths of flowers to the stage. It would be in New York City or else in a foreign country. Famous people would point at her--Carole Lombard and Arturo Toscanini and Admiral Byrd.",0
6643,"And she could play the Beethoven symphony any time she wanted to. It was a queer thing about this music she had heard last autumn. The symphony stayed inside her always and grew little by little. The reason was this: the whole symphony was in her mind. It had to be. She had heard every note, and somewhere in the back of her mind the whole of the music was still there just as it had been played. But she could do nothing to bring it all out again. Except wait and be ready for the times when suddenly a new part came to her. Wait for it to grow like leaves grow slowly on the branches of a spring oak tree.",0
6644,"In the inside room, along with music, there was Mister Singer. Every afternoon as soon as she finished playing on the piano in the gym she walked down the main street past the store where he worked. From the front window she couldn't see Mister Singer. He worked in the back, behind a curtain. But she looked at the store where he stayed every day and saw the people he knew. Then every night she waited on the front porch for him to come home. Sometimes she followed him upstairs. She sat on the bed and watched him put away his hat and undo the button on his collar and brush his hair. For some reason it was like they had a secret together. Or like they waited to tell each other things that had never been said before.",0
6645,"He was the only person in the inside room. A long time ago there had been others. She thought back and remembered how it was before he came. She remembered a girl way back in the sixth grade named Celeste. This girl had straight blonde hair and a turned-up nose and freckles. She wore a red-wool jumper with a white blouse. She walked pigeon-toed. Every day she brought an orange for little recess and a blue tin box of lunch for big recess. Other kids would gobble the food they had brought at little recess and then were hungry later--but not Celeste. She pulled off the crusts of her sandwiches and ate only the soft middle part. Always she had a stuffed hard-boiled egg and she would hold it in her hand, mashing the yellow with her thumb so that the print of her finger was left there.",0
6646,Celeste never talked to her and she never talked to Celeste. Although that was what she wanted more than anything else. At night she would lie awake and think about Celeste. She would plan that they were best friends and think about the time when Celeste could come home with her to eat supper and spend the night. But that never happened. The way she felt about Celeste would never let her go up and make friends with her like she would any other person. After a year Celeste moved to another part of town and went to another school.,0
6647,"Then there was a boy called Buck. He was big and had pimples on his face. When she stood by him in line to march in at eight-thirty he smelled bad--like his britches needed airing. Buck did a nose dive at the principal once and was suspended. When he laughed he lifted his upper lip and shook all over. She thought about him like she had thought about Celeste. Then there was the lady who sold lottery tickets for a turkey raffle. And Miss Anglin, who taught the seventh grade. And Carole Lombard in the movies. All of them.",0
6648,"But with Mister Singer there was a difference. The way she felt about him came on her slowly, and she could not think back and realize just how it happened. The other people had been ordinary, but Mister Singer was not. The first day he rang the doorbell to ask about a room she had looked a long time into his face. She had opened the door and read over the card he handed her. Then she called her Mama and went back in the kitchen to tell Portia and Bubber about him. She followed him and her Mama up the stairs and watched him poke the mattress on the bed and roll up the shades to see if they worked. The day he moved she sat on the front porch banisters and watched him get out of the ten-cent taxi with his suitcase and his chessboard. Then later she listened to him thump around in his room and imagined about him. The rest came in a gradual way. So that now there was this secret feeling between them. She talked to him more than she had ever talked to a person before. And if he could have talked he would have told her many things. It was like he was some kind of a great teacher, only because he was a mute he did not teach. In the bed at night she planned about how she was an orphan and lived with Mister Singer--just the two of them in a foreign house where in the winter it would snow. Maybe in a little Switzerland town with the high glaciers and the mountains all around. Where rocks were on top of all the houses and the roofs were steep and pointed. Or in France where the people carried home bread from the store without its being wrapped. Or in the foreign country of Norway by the gray winter ocean.",0
6649,In the morning the first thing she would think of him. Along with music. When she put on her dress she wondered where she would see him that day. She used some of Etta's perfume or a drop of vanilla so that if she met him in the hall she would smell good. She went to school late so she could see him come down the stairs on his way to work. And in the afternoon and night she never left the house if he was there.,0
6650,"Each new thing she learned about him was important. He kept his toothbrush and toothpaste in a glass on his table. So instead of leaving her toothbrush on the bathroom shelf she kept it in a glass, also. He didn't like cabbage. Harry, who worked for Mister Brannon, mentioned that to her. Now she couldn't eat cabbage either. When she learned new facts about him, or when she said something to him and he wrote a few words with his silver pencil, she had to be off by herself for a long time to think it over. When she was with him the main thought in her mind was to store up everything so that later she could live it over and remember.",0
6651,"But in the inside room with music and Mister Singer was not all. Many things happened in the outside room. She fell down the stairs and broke off one of her front teeth. Miss Minner gave her two bad cards in English. She lost a quarter in a vacant lot, and although she and George hunted for three days they never found it.",0
6652,"This happened:  One afternoon she was studying for an English test out on the back steps. Harry began to chop wood over on his side of the fence and she hollered to him. He came and diagrammed a few sentences for her. His eyes were quick behind his horn-rimmed glasses. After he explained the English to her he stood up and jerked his hands in and out the pockets of his lumberjack. Harry was always full of energy, nervous, and he had to be talking or doing something every minute.",0
6653,"'You see, there's just two things nowadays,' he said. He liked to surprise people and sometimes she didn't know how to answer him. 'It's the truth, there's just two things ahead nowadays. '",0
6654,"'What?'  'Militant Democracy or Fascism. '  'Don't you like Republicans?' 'Shucks,' Harry said. 'That's not what I mean. '",0
6655,He had explained all about the Fascists one afternoon. He told how the Nazis made little Jew children get down on their hands and knees and eat grass from the ground. He told about how he planned to assassinate Hitler. He had it all worked out thoroughly. He told about how there wasn't any justice or freedom in Fascism. He said the newspapers wrote deliberate lies and people didn't know what was going on in the world. The Nazis were terrible--everybody knew that. She plotted with him to kill Hitler. It would be better to have four or five people in the conspiracy so that if one missed him the others could bump him off just the same. And even if they died they would all be heroes. To be a hero was almost like being a great musician.,0
6656,'Either one or the other. And although I don't believe in war I'm ready to fight for what I know is right. ',0
6657,"'Me too,' she said. 'I'd like to fight the Fascists. I could dress up like a boy and nobody could ever tell. Cut my hair off and all. '",0
6658,"It was a bright winter afternoon. The sky was blue-green and the branches of the oak trees in the back yard were black and bare against this color. The sun was warm. The day made her feel full of energy. Music was in her mind. Just to be doing something she picked up a tenpenny nail and drove it into the steps with a few good wallops. Their Dad heard the sound of the hammer and came out in his bathrobe to stand around awhile. Under the tree there were two carpenter's horses, and little Ralph was busy putting a rock on top of one and then carrying it over to the other one. Back and forth. He walked with his hands out to balance himself. He was bowlegged and his diapers dragged down to his knees. George was shooting marbles. Because he needed a haircut his face looked thin. Some of his permanent teeth had already come--but they were small and blue like he had been eating blackberries. He drew a line for taw and lay on his stomach to take aim for the first hole. When their Dad went back to his watch work he carried Ralph with him. And after a while George went off into the alley by himself. Since he shot Baby he wouldn't buddy with a single person.",0
6659,"'I got to go,' Harry said. 'I got to be at work before six.' 'You like it at the café? Do you get good things to eat free?'  'Sure.",0
6660,And all kinds of folks come in the place. I like it better than any job I ever had. It pays more. ',0
6661,"'I hate Mister Brannon,' Mick said. It was true that even though he never said anything mean to her he always spoke in a rough, funny way. He must have known all along about the pack of chewing-gum she and George swiped that time. And then why would he ask her how her business was coming along--like he did up in Mister Singer's room? Maybe he thought they took things regular. And they didn't. They certainly did not. Only once a little water-color set from the ten-cent store. And a nickel pencil-sharpener.",0
6662,"'I can't stand Mister Brannon.' 'He's all right,' Harry said. ' Sometimes he seems a right queer kind of person, but he's not crabby. When you get to know him. '",0
6663,"'One thing I've thought about,' Mick said. ' A boy has a better advantage like that than a girl. I mean a boy can usually get some part-time job that don't take him out of school and leaves him time for other things. But there're not jobs like that for girls. When a girl wants a job she has to quit school and work full time. I'd sure like to earn a couple of bucks a week like you do, but there's just not any way. '",0
6664,Harry sat on the steps and untied his shoestrings. He pulled at them until one broke. 'A man comes to the café named Mr. Blount. Mr. Jake Blount. I like to listen to him. I learn a lot from the things he says when he drinks beer. He's given me some new ideas. ',0
6665,'I know him good. He comes here every Sunday. ',0
6666,Harry unlaced his shoe and pulled the broken string to even lengths so he could tie it in a bow again. 'Listen'--he rubbed his glasses on his lumberjack in a nervous way--'You needn't mention to him what I said. I mean I doubt if he would remember me. He don't talk to me. He just talks to Mr. Singer. He might think it was funny if you--you know what I mean.',0
6667,'O.K.' She read between the words that he had a crush on Mister Blount and she knew how he felt. 'I wouldn't mention it. ',0
6668,"Dark came on. The moon, white like milk, showed in the blue sky and the air was cold. She could hear Ralph and George and Portia in the kitchen. The fire in the stove made the kitchen window a warm orange. There was the smell of smoke and supper.",0
6669,"'You know this is something I never have told anybody,' he said. 'I hate to realize about it myself. '",0
6670,"'What?'  'You remember when you first began to read the newspapers and think about the things you read?'  'Sure.'  'I used to be a Fascist. I used to think I was. It was this way. You know all the pictures of the people our age in Europe marching and singing songs and keeping step together. I used to think that was wonderful. All of them pledged to each other and with one leader. All of them with the same ideals and marching in step together. I didn't worry much about what was happening to the Jewish minorities because I didn't want to think about it. And because at the time I didn't want to think like I was Jewish. You see, I didn't know. I just looked at the pictures and read what it said underneath and didn't understand. I never knew what an awful thing it was. I thought I was a Fascist. Of course later on I found out different. '",0
6671,"His voice was bitter against himself and kept changing from a man's voice to a young boy's. 'Well, you didn't realize then----' she said. 'It was a terrible transgression. A moral wrong. '",0
6672,"That was the way he was. Everything was either very right or very wrong--with no middle way. It was wrong for anyone under twenty to touch beer or wine or smoke a cigarette. It was a terrible sin for a person to cheat on a test, but not a sin to copy homework. It was a moral wrong for girls to wear lipstick or sun-backed dresses. It was a terrible sin to buy anything with a German or Japanese label, no matter if it cost only a nickel.",0
6673,"She remembered Harry back to the time when they were kids. Once his eyes got crossed and stayed crossed for a year. He would sit out on his front steps with his hands between his knees and watch everything. Very quiet and cross-eyed. He skipped two grades in grammar school and when he was eleven he was ready for Vocational. But at Vocational when they read about the Jew in 'Ivanhoe' the other kids would look around at Harry and he would come home and cry. So his mother took him out of school. He stayed out for a whole year. He grew taller and very fat. Every time she climbed the fence she would see him making himself something to eat in his kitchen. They both played around on the block, and sometimes they would wrestle. When she was a kid she liked to fight with boys--not real fights but just in play. She used a combination jujitsu and boxing. Sometimes he got her down and sometimes she got him. Harry never was very rough with anybody. When little kids ever broke any toy they would come to him and he always took the time to fix it. He could fix anything. The ladies on the block got him to fix their electric lights or sewing-machines when something went wrong. Then when he was thirteen he started back at Vocational and began to study hard. He threw papers and worked on Saturdays and read. For a long time she didn't see much of him--until after that party she gave. He was very changed.",0
6674,"'Like this,' Harry said. 'It used to be I had some big ambition for myself all the time. A great engineer or a great doctor or lawyer. But now I don't have it that way. All I can think about is what happens in the world now. About Fascism and the terrible things in Europe--and on the other hand Democracy. I mean I can't think and work on what I mean to be in life because I think too much about this other. I dream about killing Hitler every night. And I wake up in the dark very thirsty and scared of something--I don't know what. '",0
6675,"She looked at Harry's face and a deep, serious feeling made her sad. His hair hung over his forehead. His upper lip was thin and tight but the lower one was thick and it trembled. Harry didn't look old enough to be fifteen. With the darkness a cold wind came. The wind sang up in the oak trees on the block and banged the blinds against the side of the house. Down the street Mrs. Wells was calling Sucker home. The dark late afternoon made the sadness heavy inside her. I want a piano--I want to take music lessons, she said to herself. She looked at Harry and he was lacing his thin fingers together in different shapes. There was a warm boy smell about him.",0
6676,"What was it made her act like she suddenly did? Maybe it was remembering the times when they were younger. Maybe it was because the sadness made her feel queer. But anyway all of a sudden she gave Harry a push that nearly knocked him off the steps. 'S.O.B. to your Grandmother,' she hollered to him. Then she ran. That was what kids used to say in the neighborhood when they picked a fight. Harry stood up and looked surprised. He settled his glasses on his nose and watched her for a second. Then he ran back to the alley.",0
6677,"The cold air made her strong as Samson. When she laughed there was a short, quick echo. She butted Harry with her shoulder and he got a holt on her. They wrestled hard and laughed. She was the tallest but his hands were strong. He didn't fight good enough and she got him on the ground. Then suddenly he stopped moving and she stopped too. His breathing was warm on her neck and he was very still. She felt his ribs against her knees and his hard breathing as she sat on him. They got up together. They did not laugh any more and the alley was very quiet. As they walked across the dark back yard for some reason she felt funny. There was nothing to feel queer about, but suddenly it had just happened. She gave him a little push and he pushed her back. Then she laughed again and felt all right.",0
6678,"'So long,' Harry said. He was too old to climb the fence, so he ran through the side alley to the front of his house. * * * * *  'Gosh, it's hot!'",0
6679,she said. 'I could smother in here. ',0
6680,Portia was warming her supper in the stove. Ralph banged his spoon on his high-chair tray. George's dirty little hand pushed up his grits with a piece of bread and his eyes were squinted in a faraway look. She helped herself to white meat and gravy and grits and a few raisins and mixed them up together on her plate. She ate three bites of them. She ate until all the grits were gone but still she wasn't full.,0
6681,"She had thought about Mister Singer all the day, and as soon as supper was over and she went upstairs. But when she reached the third floor she saw that his door was open and his room dark. This gave her an empty feeling.",0
6682,Downstairs she couldn't sit still and study for the English test. It was like she was so strong she couldn't sit on a chair in a room the same as other people. It was like she could knock down all the walls of the house and then march through the streets big as a giant.,0
6683,"Finally she got out her private box from under the bed. She lay on her stomach and looked over the notebook. There were about twenty songs now, but she didn't feel satisfied with them. If she could write a symphony! For a whole orchestra--how did you write that? Sometimes several instruments played one note, so the staff would have to be very large. She drew five lines across a big sheet of test paper--the lines about an inch apart. When a note was for violin or 'cello or flute she would write the name of the instrument to show. And when they all played the same note together she would draw a circle around them. At the top of the page she wrote Symphony in large letters. And under that Mick Kelly. Then she couldn't go any further.",0
6684,If she could only have music lessons! If only she could have a real piano! A long time passed before she could get started. The tunes were in her mind but she couldn't figure how to write them. It looked like this was the hardest play in the world. But she kept on figuring until Etta and Hazel came into the room and got into bed and said she had to turn the light off because it was eleven o'clock.,0
6685,[10] For six weeks Portia had waited to hear from William. Every evening she would come to the house and ask Doctor Copeland the same question: 'You seen anybody who gotten a letter from Willie yet?' And every night he was obliged to tell her that he had heard nothing.,0
6686,At last she asked the question no more. She would come into the hall and look at him without a word. She drank. Her blouse was often half unbuttoned and her shoestrings loose.,0
6687,"February came. The weather turned milder, then hot. The sun glared down with hard brilliance. Birds sang in the bare trees and children played out of doors barefoot and naked to the waist. The nights were torrid as in midsummer. Then after a few days winter was upon the town again. The mild skies darkened. A chill rain fell and the air turned dank and bitterly cold. In the town the Negroes suffered badly. Supplies of fuel had been exhausted and there was a struggle everywhere for warmth. An epidemic of pneumonia raged through the wet, narrow streets, and for a week Doctor Copeland slept at odd hours, fully clothed. Still no word came from William. Portia had written four times and Doctor Copeland twice.",0
6688,"During most of the day and night he had no time to think. But occasionally he found a chance to rest for a moment at home. He would drink a pot of coffee by the kitchen stove and a deep uneasiness would come in him. Five of his patients had died. And one of these was Augustus Benedict Mady Lewis, the little deaf-mute. He had been asked to speak at the burial service, but as it was his rule not to attend funerals he was unable to accept this invitation. The five patients had not been lost because of any negligence on his part. The blame was in the long years of want which lay behind. The diets of cornbread and sowbelly and syrup, the crowding of four and five persons to a single room. The death of poverty. He brooded on this and drank coffee to stay awake. Often he held his hand to his chin, for recently a slight tremor in the nerves of his neck made his head nod unsteadily when he was tired.",0
6689,"Then during the fourth week of February Portia came to the house. It was only six o'clock in the morning and he was sitting by the fire in the kitchen, warming a pan of milk for breakfast. She was badly intoxicated. He smelled the keen, sweetish odor of gin and his nostrils widened with disgust. He did not look at her but busied himself with his breakfast. He crumbled some bread in a bowl and poured over it hot milk. He prepared coffee and laid the table.",0
6690,"Then when he was seated before his breakfast he looked at Portia sternly. 'Have you had your morning meal?'  'I not going to eat breakfast,' she said. 'You will need it. If you intend to get to work today. '",0
6691,'I not going to work.' A dread came in him. He did not wish to question her further. He kept his eyes on his bowl of milk and drank from a spoon that was unsteady in his hand. When he had finished he looked up at the wall above her head. 'Are you tongue-tied?'  'I going to tell you.,0
6692,"You going to hear about it. Just as soon as I able to say it I going to tell you.'  Portia sat motionless in the chair, her eyes moving slowly from one corner of the wall to the other. Her arms hung down limp and her legs were twisted loosely about each other. When he turned from her he had for a moment a perilous sense of ease and freedom, which was more acute because he knew that soon it was to be shattered. He mended the fire and warmed his hands. Then he rolled a cigarette. The kitchen was in a state of spotless order and cleanliness. The saucepans on the wall glowed with the light of the stove and behind each one there was a round, black shadow.",0
6693,"'It about Willie.' 'I know.' He rolled the cigarette gingerly between his palms. His eyes glanced recklessly about him, greedy for the last sweet pleasures.",0
6694,'Once I mentioned to you this here Buster Johnston were at the prison with Willie. Us knowed him before. He were sent home yesdiddy.'  'So?'  'Buster been crippled for life.',0
6695,"His head quavered. He pressed his hand to his chin to steady himself, but the obstinate trembling was difficult to control. 'Last night these here friends come round to my house and say that Buster were home and had something to tell me about Willie. I run all the way and this here is what he said.'",0
6696,'Yes.'  'There were three of them. Willie and Buster and this other boy. They were friends. Then this here trouble come up.' Portia halted. She wet her finger with her tongue and then moistened her dry lips with her finger. 'It were something to do with the way this here white guard picked on them all the time. They were out on roadwork one day and Buster he sassed back and then the other boy he try to run off in the woods. They taken all three of them. They taken all three of them to the camp and put them in this here ice-cold room.',0
6697,"He said yes again. But his head quavered and the word sounded like a rattle in his throat. 'It were about six weeks ago,' Portia said. 'You remember that cold spell then. They put Willie and them boys in this room like ice.'",0
6698,"Portia spoke in a low voice, and she neither paused between words nor did the grief in her face soften. It was like a low song. She spoke and he could not understand. The sounds were distinct in his ear but they had no shape or meaning. It was as though his head were the prow of a boat and the sounds were water that broke on him and then flowed past. He felt he had to look behind to find the words already said.",0
6699,'...and their feets swelled up and they lay there and struggle on the floor and holler out. And nobody come. They hollered there for three days and three nights and nobody come.',0
6700,"'I am deaf,' said Doctor Copeland. 'I cannot understand.' 'They put our Willie and them boys in this here ice-cold room. There were a rope hanging down from the ceiling. They taken their shoes off and tied their bare feets to this rope. Willie and them boys lay there with their backs on the floor and their feets in the air. And their feets swelled up and they struggle on the floor and holler out. It were ice-cold in the room and their feets froze. Their feets swelled up and they hollered for three nights and three days. And nobody come.'",0
6701,"Doctor Copeland pressed his head with his hands, but still the steady trembling would not stop. 'I cannot hear what you say.' 'Then at last they come to get them. They quickly taken Willie and them boys to the sick ward and their legs were all swelled and froze. Gangrene. They sawed off both our Willie's feets. Buster Johnson lost one foot and the other boy got well. But our Willie--he crippled for life now. Both his feet sawed off.'",0
6702,"The words were finished and Portia leaned over and struck her head upon the table. She did not cry or moan, but she struck her head again and again on the hard-scrubbed top of the table. The bowl and spoon rattled and he removed them to the sink. The words were scattered in his mind, but he did not try to assemble them. He scalded the bowl and spoon and washed out the dishtowel. He picked up something from the floor and put it somewhere.",0
6703,'Crippled?' he asked. 'William?'  Portia knocked her head on the table and the blows had a rhythm like the slow beat of a drum and his heart took up this rhythm also. Quietly the words came alive and fitted to the meaning and he understood.,0
6704,'When will they send him home?' Portia leaned her drooping head on her arm. 'Buster don't know that. Soon afterward they separate all three of them in different places. They sent Buster to another camp. Since Willie only haves a few more months he think he liable to be home soon now. ',0
6705,"They drank coffee and sat for a long time, looking into each other's eyes. His cup rattled against his teeth. She poured her coffee into a saucer and some of it dripped down on her lap.",0
6706,'William----' Doctor Copeland said. As he pronounced the name his teeth bit deeply into his tongue and he moved his jaw with pain. They sat for a long while. Portia held his hand. The bleak morning light made the windows gray. Outside it was still raining.,0
6707,"'If I means to get to work I better go on now,' Portia said. He followed her through the hall and stopped at the hatrack to put on his coat and shawl. The open door let in a gust of wet, cold air. Highboy sat out on the street curb with a wet newspaper over his head for protection. Along the sidewalk there was a fence. Portia leaned against this as she walked. Doctor Copeland followed a few paces after her and his hands, also, touched the boards of the fence to steady himself. Highboy trailed behind them.",0
6708,"He waited for the black, terrible anger as though for some beast out of the night. But it did not come to him. His bowels seemed weighted with lead, and he walked slowly and lingered against fences and the cold, wet walls of buildings by the way. Descent into the depths until at last there was no further chasm below. He touched the solid bottom of despair and there took ease.",0
6709,"In this he knew a certain strong and holy gladness. The persecuted laugh, and the black slave sings to his outraged soul beneath the whip. A song was in him now--although it was not music but only the feeling of a song. And the sodden heaviness of peace weighted down his limbs so that it was only with the strong, true purpose that he moved. Why did he go onward? Why did he not rest here upon this bottom of utmost humiliation and for a while take his content?",0
6710,"But he went onward. * * * * *  'Uncle,' said Mick.",0
6711,"'You think some hot coffee would make you feel better?'  Doctor Copeland looked into her face but gave no sign that he heard. They had crossed the town and come at last to the alley behind the Kellys' house. Portia had entered first and then he followed. Highboy remained on the steps outside. Mick and her two little brothers were already in the kitchen. Portia told of William. Doctor Copeland did not listen to the words but her voice had a rhythm--a start, a middle, and an end. Then when she was finished she began all over. Others came into the room to hear.",0
6712,"Doctor Copeland sat on a stool in the corner. His coat and shawl steamed over the back of a chair by the stove. He held his hat on his knees and his long, dark hands moved nervously around the worn brim. The yellow insides of his hands were so moist that occasionally he wiped them with a handkerchief. His head trembled, and all of his muscles were stiff with the effort to make it be still.",0
6713,"Mr. Singer came into the room. Doctor Copeland raised up his face to him. 'Have you heard of this?' he asked. Mr. Singer nodded. In his eyes there was no horror or pity or hate. Of all those who knew, his eyes alone did not express these reactions. For he alone understood this thing.",0
6714,"Mick whispered to Portia, 'What's your father's name?'  'He named Benedict Mady Copeland.' Mick leaned over close to Doctor Copeland and shouted in his face as though he were deaf. 'Benedict, don't you think some hot coffee would make you feel a little better?'  Doctor Copeland started.",0
6715,"'Quit that hollering,' Portia said. 'He can hear well as you can.' 'Oh,' said Mick. She emptied the grounds from the pot and put the coffee on the stove to boil again.",0
6716,The mute still lingered in the doorway. Doctor Copeland still looked into his face. 'You heard?'  'What'll they do to those prison guards?',0
6717,"Mick asked. 'Honey, I just don't know,' Portia said. 'I just don't know. '",0
6718,'I'd do something. I'd sure do something about it. ',0
6719,'Nothing us could do would make no difference. Best thing us can do is keep our mouth shut. ',0
6720,'They ought to be treated just like they did Willie and them. Worse. I wish I could round up some people and kill those men myself. ',0
6721,"'That ain't no Christian way to talk,' Portia said. 'Us can just rest back and know they going to be chopped up with pitchforks and fried everlasting by Satan.' 'Anyway Willie can still play his harp. '",0
6722,'With both feets sawed off that about all he can do.' The house was full of noise and unrest. In the room above the kitchen someone was moving furniture about. The dining-room was crowded with boarders. Mrs. Kelly hurried back and forth from the breakfast table to the kitchen. Mr. Kelly wandered about in a baggy pair of trousers and a bathrobe. The young Kelly children ate greedily in the kitchen. Doors banged and voices could be heard in all parts of the house.,0
6723,"Mick handed Doctor Copeland a cup of coffee mixed with watery milk. The milk gave the drink a gray-blue sheen. Some of the coffee had sloshed over into the saucer, so first he dried the saucer and the rim of the cup with his handkerchief. He had not wanted coffee at all.",0
6724,"'I wish I could kill them,' Mick said. The house quieted. The people in the dining-room went out to work. Mick and George left for school and the baby was shut into one of the front rooms. Mrs. Kelly wrapped a towel around her head and took a broom with her upstairs.",0
6725,The mute still stood in the doorway. Doctor Copeland gazed up into his face. 'You know of this?' he asked again. The words did not sound--they choked in his throat--but his eyes asked the question all the same. Then the mute was gone. Doctor Copeland and Portia were alone. He sat for some time on the stool in the corner. At last he rose to go.,0
6726,"'You sit back down, Father. Us going to stay together this morning. I going to fry some fish and have egg-bread and potatoes for the dinner. You stay on here, and then I means to serve you a good hot meal.'",0
6727,"'You know I have calls.' 'Less us just this one day. Please, Father. I feels like I going to really bust loose. Besides, I don't want you messing around in the streets by yourself.'",0
6728,"He hesitated and felt the collar of his overcoat. It was very damp. 'Daughter , I am sorry. You know I have visits.'",0
6729,Portia held his shawl over the stove until the wool was hot. She buttoned his coat and turned up the collar about his neck. He cleared his throat and spat into one of the squares of paper that he carried with him in his pocket. Then he burned the paper in the stove. On the way out he stopped and spoke to Highboy on the steps. He suggested that Highboy stay with Portia if he could arrange to get leave from work.,0
6730,"The air was piercing and cold. From the low, dark skies the drizzling rain fell steadily. The rain had seeped into the garbage cans and in the alley there was the rank odor of wet refuse. As he walked he balanced himself with the help of a fence and kept his dark eyes on the ground.",0
6731,He made all of the strictly necessary visits. Then he attended to office patients from noon until two o'clock. Afterward he sat at his desk with his fists clenched tight. But it was useless to try to cogitate on this thing.,0
6732,"He wished never again to see a human face. Yet at the same time he could not sit alone in the empty room. He put on his overcoat and went out again into the wet, cold street. In his pocket were several prescriptions to be left at the pharmacy. But he did not wish to speak with Marshall Nicolls. He went into the store and laid the prescriptions upon the counter. The pharmacist turned from the powders he was measuring and held out both his hands. His thick lips worked soundlessly for a moment before he gained his poise.",0
6733,"'Doctor,' he said formally. 'You must be aware that I and all our colleagues and the members of my lodge and church--we have your sorrow uppermost in our minds and wish to extend to you our deepest sympathy. '",0
6734,"Doctor Copeland turned shortly and left without a word. That was too little. Something more was needed. The strong, true purpose, the will to justice. He walked stiffly, his arms held close to his sides, toward the main street. He cogitated without success. He could think of no white person of power in all the town who was both brave and just. He thought of every lawyer, every judge, every public official with whose name he was familiar--but the thought of each one of these white men was bitter in his heart. At last he decided on the judge of the Superior Court. When he reached the courthouse he did not hesitate but entered quickly, determined to see the judge that afternoon.",0
6735,"The wide front hall was empty except for a few idlers who lounged in the doorways leading to the offices on either side. He did not know where he could find the judge's office, so he wandered uncertainly through the building, looking at the placards on the doors. At last he came to a narrow passage. Halfway through this corridor three white men stood talking together and blocked the way. He drew close to the wall to pass, but one of them turned to stop him.",0
6736,"'What you want?'  'Will you please tell me where the judge's office is located?' The white man jerked his thumb toward the end of the passage. Doctor Copeland recognized him as a deputy sheriff. They had seen each other dozens of times but the deputy did not remember him. All white people looked similar to Negroes but Negroes took care to differentiate between them. On the other hand, all Negroes looked similar to white men but white men did not usually bother to fix the face of a Negro in their minds. So the white man said, 'What you want, Reverend?'",0
6737,"The familiar joking title nettled him. 'I am not a minister,' he said. 'I am a physician, a medical doctor. My name is Benedict Mady Copeland and I wish to see the judge immediately on urgent business.'",0
6738,The deputy was like other white men in that a clearly enunciated speech maddened him. 'Is that so?' he mocked. He winked at his friends. ' Then I am the deputy sheriff and my name is Mister Wilson and I tell you the judge is busy. Come back some other day. ',0
6739,"'It is imperative that I see the judge,' Doctor Copeland said. 'I will wait.' There was a bench at the entrance of the passage and he sat down. The three white men continued to talk, but he knew that the sheriff watched him. He was determined not to leave. More than half an hour passed. Several white men went freely back and forth through the corridor. He knew that the deputy was watching him and he sat rigid, his hands pressed between his knees. His sense of prudence told him to go away and return later in the afternoon when the sheriff was not there. All of his life he had been circumspect in his dealings with such people. But now something in him would not let him withdraw.",0
6740,"'Come here, you!' the deputy said finally. His head trembled, and when he arose he was not steady on his feet. 'Yes?'  'What you say you wanted to see the judge about?'  'I did not say,' said Doctor Copeland.",0
6741,"'I merely said that my business with him was urgent.' 'You can't stand up straight. You been drinking liquor, haven't you? I smell it on your breath.'",0
6742,"'That is a lie,' said Doctor Copeland slowly. 'I have not----'  The sheriff struck him on the face. He fell against the wall. Two white men grasped him by the arms and dragged him down the steps to the main floor. He did not resist.",0
6743,"'That's the trouble with this country,' the sheriff said. 'These damn biggity niggers like him.' He spoke no word and let them do with him as they would. He waited for the terrible anger and felt it arise in him. Rage made him weak, so that he stumbled. They put him into the wagon with two men as guards. They took him to the station and then to the jail. It was only when they had entered the jail that the strength of his rage came to him. He broke loose suddenly from their grasp. In a corner he was surrounded. They struck him on the head and shoulders with their clubs. A glorious strength was in him and he heard himself laughing aloud as he fought. He sobbed and laughed at the same time. He kicked wildly with his feet. He fought with his fists and even struck at them with his head. Then he was clutched fast so that he could not move. They dragged him foot by foot through the hall of the jail. The door to a cell was opened. Someone behind kicked him in the groin and he fell to his knees on the floor.",0
6744,* * * * *  In the cramped cubicle there were five other prisoners--three Negroes and two white men. One of the white men was very old and drunk. He sat on the floor and scratched himself. The other white prisoner was a boy not more than fifteen years of age. The three Negroes were young. As Doctor Copeland lay on the bunk looking up into their faces he recognized one of them.,0
6745,'How come you here?' the young man asked. ' Ain't you Doctor Copeland?'  He said yes.,0
6746,'My name Dary White. You taken out my sister's tonsils last year. ',0
6747,"The icy cell was permeated with a rotten odor. A pail brimming with urine was in a corner. Cockroaches crawled upon the walls. He closed his eyes and immediately he must have slept, for when he looked up again the small barred window was black and a bright light burned in the hall. Four empty tin plates were on the floor. His dinner of cabbage and cornbread was beside him.",0
6748,"He sat on the bunk and sneezed violently several times. When he breathed the phlegm rattled in his chest. After a while the young white boy began to sneeze also. Doctor Copeland gave out squares of paper and had to use sheets from a notebook in his pocket. The white boy leaned over the pail in the corner or simply let the water run from his nose onto the front of his shirt. His eyes were dilated, his clear cheeks flushed. He huddled on the edge of a bunk and groaned.",0
6749,"Soon they were led out to the lavatory, and on their return they prepared for sleep. There were six men to occupy four bunks. The old man lay snoring on the floor. Dary and another boy squeezed into a bunk together.",0
6750,"The hours were long. The light in the hall burned his eyes and the odor in the cell made every breath a discomfort. He could not keep warm. His teeth chattered and he shook with a hard chill. He sat up with the dirty blanket wrapped around him and swayed to and fro. Twice he reached over to cover the white boy who muttered and threw out his arms in sleep. He swayed, his head in his hands, and from his throat there came a singing moan. He could not think of William. Nor could he even cogitate upon the strong, true purpose and draw strength from that. He could only feel the misery in him.",0
6751,"Then the tide of his fever turned. A warmth spread through him. He lay back, and it seemed he sank down into a place warm and red and full of comfort.",0
6752,* * * * *  The next morning the sun came out.,0
6753,The strange Southern winter was at its end. Doctor Copeland was released. A little group waited outside the jail for him. Mr. Singer was there. Portia and Highboy and Marshall Nicolls were present also. Their faces were confused and he could not see them clearly. The sun was very bright.,0
6754,"'Father, don't you know that ain't no way to help our Willie? Messing around at a white folks' courthouse? Best thing us can do is keep our mouth shut and wait.'",0
6755,"Her loud voice echoed wearily in his ears. They climbed into a ten-cent taxicab, and then he was home and his face pressed into the fresh white pillow. [11] Mick could not sleep all night. Etta was sick, so she had to sleep in the living-room. The sofa was too narrow and short. She had nightmares about Willie. Nearly a month had gone by since Portia had told about what they had done to him--but still she couldn't forget it. Twice in the night she had these bad dreams and woke up on the floor. A bump came out on her forehead. Then at six o'clock she heard Bill go to the kitchen and fix his breakfast. It was daylight, but the shades were down so that the room was half-dark. She felt queer waking up in the living-room. She didn't like it. The sheet was twisted around her, half on the sofa and half on the floor. The pillow was in the middle of the room. She got up and opened the door to the hall. Nobody was on the stairs. She ran in her nightgown to the back room.",0
6756,"'Move over, George.' The kid lay in the very center of the bed. The night had been warm and he was naked as a jay bird. His fists were shut tight, and even in sleep his eyes were squinted like he was thinking about something very hard to figure out. His mouth was open and there was a little wet spot on the pillow. She pushed him.",0
6757,"'Wait----' he said in his sleep.  'Move over on your side.'  'Wait----Lemme just finish this here dream--this here----' She hauled him over where he belonged and lay down close to him. When she opened her eyes again it was late, because the sun shone in through the back window. George was gone. From the yard she heard kids' voices and the sound of water running. Etta and Hazel were talking in the middle room. As she dressed a sudden notion came to her. She listened at the door but it was hard to hear what they said. She jerked the door open quick to surprise them.",0
6758,"They were reading a movie magazine. Etta was still in bed. She had her hand halfway over the picture of an actor. 'From here up don't you think he favors that boy who used to date with----'  'How you feel this morning, Etta?'",0
6759,"Mick asked. She looked down under the bed and her private box was still in the exact place where she had left it. 'A lot you care,' Etta said.",0
6760,'You needn't try to pick a fight. ' Etta's face was peaked. There was a terrible pain in her stomach and her ovary was diseased. It had something to do with being unwell. The doctor said they would have to cut out her ovary right away. But their Dad said they would have to wait. There wasn't any money.,0
6761,"'How you expect me to act, anyway?' Mick said. 'I ask you a polite question and then you start to nag at me. I feel like I ought to be sorry for you because you're sick, but you won't let me be decent. Therefore I naturally get mad.' She pushed back the bangs of her hair and looked close into the mirror. 'Boy! See this bump I got! I bet my head's broke. Twice I fell out last night and it seemed to me like I hit that table by the sofa. I can't sleep in the living-room. That sofa cramps me so much I can't stay in it. '",0
6762,"'Hush that talking so loud,' Hazel said. Mick knelt down on the floor and pulled out the big box. She looked carefully at the string that was tied around it. 'Say, have either of you fooled with this?'  'Shoot!'",0
6763,Etta said. 'What would we want to mess with your junk for?' 'You just better not. I'd kill anybody that tried to mess with my private things.',0
6764,"'Listen to that,' Hazel said. 'Mick Kelly, I think you're the most selfish person I've ever known. You don't care a thing in the world about anybody but----'  'Aw, poot!'",0
6765,"She slammed the door. She hated both of them. That was a terrible thing to think, but it was true.",0
6766,Her Dad was in the kitchen with Portia. He had on his bathrobe and was drinking a cup of coffee. The whites of his eyes were red and his cup rattled against his saucer. He walked round and round the kitchen table.,0
6767,"'What time is it? Has Mister Singer gone yet?'  'He been gone, Hon,' Portia said. 'It near about ten o'clock.'  'Ten o'clock!",0
6768,Golly! I never have slept that late before. ',0
6769,'What you keep in that big hatbox you tote around with you?'  Mick reached into the stove and brought out half a dozen biscuits. 'Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies. A bad end comes to a person who pries.',0
6770,"'If there's a little extra milk I think I'll just have it poured over some crumbled bread,' her Dad said. 'Graveyard soup. Maybe that will help settle my stomach.'",0
6771,"Mick split open the biscuits and put slices of fried white meat inside them. She sat down on the back steps to eat her breakfast. The morning was warm and bright. Spareribs and Sucker were playing with George in the back yard. Sucker wore his sun suit and the other two kids had taken off all their clothes except their shorts. They were scooting each other with the hose. The stream of water sparkled bright in the sun. The wind blew out sprays of it like mist and in this mist there were the colors of the rainbow. A line of clothes flapped in the wind--white sheets, Ralph's blue dress, a red blouse and nightgowns--wet and fresh and blowing out in different shapes. The day was almost like summer-time. Fuzzy little yellow jackets buzzed around the honeysuckle on the alley fence.",0
6772,'Watch me hold it up over my head!' George hollered. 'Watch how the water runs down. ',0
6773,She was too full of energy to sit still. George had filled a meal sack with dirt and hung it to a limb of the tree for a punching bag. She began to hit this. Puck! Pock! She hit it in time to the song that had been in her mind when she woke up. George had mixed a sharp rock in the dirt and it bruised her knuckles.,0
6774,'Aoow! You skeeted the water right in my ear. It's busted my eardrum. I can't even hear. ',0
6775,"'Gimme here. Let me skeet some.'  Sprays of the water blew into her face, and once the kids turned the hose on her legs. She was afraid her box would get wet, so she carried it with her through the alley to the front porch. Harry was sitting on his steps reading the newspaper. She opened her box and got out the notebook. But it was hard to settle her mind on the song she wanted to write down. Harry was looking over in her direction and she could not think.",0
6776,"She and Harry had talked about so many things lately. Nearly every day they walked home from school together. They talked about God. Sometimes she would wake up in the night and shiver over what they had said. Harry was a Pantheist. That was a religion, the same as Baptist or Catholic or Jew. Harry believed that after you were dead and buried you changed to plants and fire and dirt and clouds and water. It took thousands of years and then finally you were a part of all the world. He said he thought that was better than being one single angel. Anyhow it was better than nothing.",0
6777,"Harry threw the newspaper into his hall and then came over. 'It's like hot summer,' he said. ' And only March.'",0
6778,'Yeah. I wish we could go swimming. ',0
6779,'We would if there was any place. ' 'There's not any place. Except that country club pool.',0
6780,"'I sure would like to do something--to get out and go somewhere. ' 'Me too,' she said. 'Wait! I know one place. It's out in the country about fifteen miles. It's a deep, wide creek in the woods. The Girl Scouts have a camp there in the summer-time. Mrs. Wells took me and George and Pete and Sucker swimming there one time last year. '",0
6781,'If you want to I can get bicycles and we can go tomorrow. I have a holiday one Sunday a month. ',0
6782,"'We'll ride out and take a picnic dinner,' Mick said. 'O.K. I'll borrow the bikes.' It was time for him to go to work. She watched him walk down the street. He swung his arms. Halfway down the block there was a bay tree with low branches. Harry took a running jump, caught a limb, and chinned himself. A happy feeling came in her because it was true they were real good friends. Also he was handsome. Tomorrow she would borrow Hazel's blue necklace and wear the silk dress. And for dinner they would take jelly sandwiches and Nehi. Maybe Harry would bring something queer, because they ate orthodox Jew. She watched him until he turned the corner. It was true that he had grown to be a very good-looking fellow.",0
6783,Harry in the country was different from Harry sitting on the back steps reading the newspapers and thinking about Hitler. They left early in the morning. The wheels he borrowed were the kind for boys--with a bar between the legs. They strapped the lunches and bathing-suits to the fenders and were gone before nine o'clock. The morning was hot and sunny. Within an hour they were far out of town on a red clay road. The fields were bright green and the sharp smell of pine trees was in the air. Harry talked in a very excited way. The warm wind blew into their faces. Her mouth was very dry and she was hungry.,0
6784,'See that house up on the hill there? Less us stop and get some water. ',0
6785,"'No, we better wait. Well water gives you typhoid. '",0
6786,'I already had typhoid. I had pneumonia and a broken leg and a infected foot. ',0
6787,"'I remember.' 'Yeah,' Mick said. 'Me and Bill stayed in the front room when we had typhoid fever and Pete Wells would run past on the sidewalk holding his nose and looking up at the window. Bill was very embarrassed. All my hair came out so I was bald-headed. '",0
6788,"'I bet we're at least ten miles from town. We've been riding an hour and a half--fast riding, too.' 'I sure am thirsty,' Mick said. 'And hungry. What you got in that sack for lunch?'  'Cold liver pudding and chicken salad sandwiches and pie.'",0
6789,'That's a good picnic dinner.' She was ashamed of what she had brought. 'I got two hard-boiled eggs--already stuffed--with separate little packages of salt and pepper. And sandwiches--blackberry jelly with butter. Everything wrapped in oil paper. And paper napkins. ',0
6790,"'I didn't intend for you to bring anything,' Harry said. ' My Mother fixed lunch for both of us. I asked you out here and all. We'll come to a store soon and get cold drinks.'",0
6791,"They rode half an hour longer before they finally came to the filling-station store. Harry propped up the bicycles and she went in ahead of him. After the bright glare the store seemed dark. The shelves were stacked with slabs of white meat, cans of oil, and sacks of meal. Flies buzzed over a big, sticky jar of loose candy on the counter.",0
6792,"'What kind of drinks you got?' Harry asked. The storeman started to name them over. Mick opened the ice box and looked inside. Her hands felt good in the cold water. 'I want a chocolate Nehi. You got any of them?'  'Ditto,' Harry said.",0
6793,"'Make it two.' 'No, wait a minute. Here's some ice-cold beer. I want a bottle of beer if you can treat as high as that. '",0
6794,"Harry ordered one for himself, also. He thought it was a sin for anybody under twenty to drink beer--but maybe he just suddenly wanted to be a sport. After the first swallow he made a bitter face. They sat on the steps in front of the store. Mick's legs were so tired that the muscles in them jumped. She wiped the neck of the bottle with her hand and took a long, cold pull. Across the road there was a big empty field of grass, and beyond that a fringe of pine woods. The trees were every color of green--from a bright yellow-green to a dark color that was almost black. The sky was hot blue.",0
6795,"'I like beer,' she said. 'I used to sop bread down in the drops our Dad left. I like to lick salt out my hand while I drink. This is the second bottle to myself I've ever had.'",0
6796,'The first swallow was sour. But the rest tastes good. ',0
6797,The storeman said it was twelve miles from town. They had four more miles to go. Harry paid him and they were out in the hot sun again. Harry was talking loud and he kept laughing without any reason.,0
6798,"'Gosh, the beer along with this hot sun makes me dizzy. But I sure do feel good,' he said. 'I can't wait to get in swimming.'",0
6799,There was sand in the road and they had to throw all their weight on the pedals to keep from bogging. Harry's shirt was stuck to his back with sweat. He still kept talking. The road changed to red clay and the sand was behind them. There was a slow colored song in her mind--one Portia's brother used to play on his harp. She pedaled in time to it.,0
6800,Then finally they reached the place she had been looking for. This is it! See that sign that says PRIVATE? We got to climb the bob-wire fence and then take that path there--see!',0
6801,"The woods were very quiet. Slick pine needles covered the ground. Within a few minutes they had reached the creek. The water was brown and swift. Cool. There was no sound except from the water and a breeze singing high up in the pine trees. It was like the deep, quiet woods made them timid, and they walked softly along the bank beside the creek.",0
6802,'Don't it look pretty. ' Harry laughed. 'What makes you whisper? Listen here!' He clapped his hand over his mouth and gave a long Indian whoop that echoed back at them. 'Come on. Let's jump in the water and cool off. '  'Aren't you hungry?'  'O.K.,0
6803,Then we'll eat first. We'll eat half the lunch now and half later on when we come out.' She unwrapped the jelly sandwiches. When they were finished Harry balled the papers neatly and stuffed them into a hollow tree stump. Then he took his shorts and went down the path. She shucked off her clothes behind a bush and struggled into Hazel's bathing-suit. The suit was too small and cut her between the legs.,0
6804,"'You ready?' Harry hollered. She heard a splash in the water and when she reached the bank Harry was already swimming. 'Don't dive yet until I find out if there are any stumps or shallow places,' he said. She just looked at his head bobbing in the water. She had never intended to dive, anyway. She couldn't even swim. She had been in swimming only a few times in her life--and then she always wore water-wings or stayed out of parts that were over her head. But it would be sissy to tell Harry. She was embarrassed. All of a sudden she told a tale:",0
6805,"'I don't dive any more. I used to dive, high dive, all the time. But once I busted my head open, so I can't dive any more.' She thought a minute. 'It was a double jack-knife dive I was doing. And when I came up there was blood all in the water. But I didn't think anything about it and just began to do swimming tricks. These people were hollering at me. Then I found out where all this blood in the water was coming from. And I never have swam good since. '",0
6806,Harry scrambled up the bank. ' Gosh! I never heard about that. ',0
6807,"She meant to add on to the tale to make it sound more reasonable, but instead she just looked at Harry. His skin was light brown and the water made it shining. There were hairs on his chest and legs. In the tight trunks he seemed very naked. Without his glasses his face was wider and more handsome. His eyes were wet and blue. He was looking at her and it was like suddenly they got embarrassed.",0
6808,"'The water's about ten feet deep except over on the other bank, and there it's shallow.' 'Less us get going. I bet that cold water feels good. '",0
6809,"She wasn't scared. She felt the same as if she had got caught at the top of a very high tree and there was nothing to do but just climb down the best way she could--a dead-calm feeling. She edged off the bank and was in the ice-cold water. She held to a root until it broke in her hands and then she began to swim. Once she choked and went under, but she kept going and didn't lose any face. She swam and reached the other side of the bank where she could touch bottom. Then she felt good. She smacked the water with her fists and called out crazy words to make echoes.",0
6810,"'Watch here!' Harry shimmied up a tall, thin little tree. The trunk was limber and when he reached the top it swayed down with him. He dropped into the water.",0
6811,'Me too! Watch me do it!' 'That's a sapling. ',0
6812,"She was as good a climber as anybody on the block. She copied exactly what he had done and hit the water with a hard smack. She could swim, too. Now she could swim O.K.",0
6813,They played follow the leader and ran up and down the bank and jumped in the cold brown water. They hollered and jumped and climbed. They played around for maybe two hours. Then they were standing on the bank and they both looked at each other and there didn't seem to be anything new to do. Suddenly she said:  'Have you ever swam naked?',0
6814,The woods was very quiet and for a minute he did not answer. He was cold. His titties had turned hard and purple. His lips were purple and his teeth chattered. 'I--I don't think so.',0
6815,"This excitement was in her, and she said something she didn't mean to say. 'I would if you would. I dare you to. '",0
6816,"Harry slicked back the dark, wet bangs of his hair. 'O.K.'  They both took off their bathing-suits. Harry had his back to her. He stumbled and his ears were red. Then they turned toward each other. Maybe it was half an hour they stood there--maybe not more than a minute.",0
6817,Harry pulled a leaf from a tree and tore it to pieces. 'We better get dressed. ',0
6818,"All through the picnic dinner neither of them spoke. They spread the dinner on the ground. Harry divided everything in half. There was the hot, sleepy feeling of a summer afternoon. In the deep woods they could hear no sound except the slow flowing of the water and the songbirds. Harry held his stuffed egg and mashed the yellow with his thumb. What did that make her remember? She heard herself breathe.",0
6819,"Then he looked up over her shoulder. 'Listen here. I think you're so pretty, Mick. I never did think so before. I don't mean I thought you were very ugly--I just mean that----'  She threw a pine cone in the water.",0
6820,' Maybe we better start back if we want to be home before dark. ',0
6821,"'No,' he said. 'Let's lie down. Just for a minute.'",0
6822,He brought handfulls of pine needles and leaves and gray moss. She sucked her knee and watched him. Her fists were tight and it was like she was tense all over.,0
6823,"'Now we can sleep and be fresh for the trip home.' They lay on the soft bed and looked up at the dark-green pine clumps against the sky. A bird sang a sad, clear song she had never heard before. One high note like an oboe--and then it sank down five tones and called again. The song was sad as a question without words.",0
6824,"'I love that bird,' Harry said. 'I think it's a vireo. '",0
6825,'I wish we was at the ocean. On the beach and watching the ships far out on the water. You went to the beach one summer--exactly what is it like?',0
6826,"His voice was rough and low. 'Well--there are the waves. Sometimes blue and sometimes green, and in the bright sun they look glassy. And on the sand you can pick up these little shells. Like the kind we brought back in a cigar box. And over the water are these white gulls. We were at the Gulf of Mexico--these cool bay breezes blew all the time and there it's never baking hot like it is here. Always----'  'Snow,' Mick said.",0
6827,"'That's what I want to see. Cold, white drifts of snow like in pictures. Blizzards. White, cold snow that keeps falling soft and falls on and on and on through all the winter. Snow like in Alaska.'",0
6828,"They both turned at the same time. They were close against each other. She felt him trembling and her fists were tight enough to crack. 'Oh, God,' he kept saying over and over. It was like her head was broke off from her body and thrown away. And her eyes looked up straight into the blinding sun while she counted something in her mind. And then this was the way.",0
6829,This was how it was. * * * * *  They pushed the wheels slowly along the road.,0
6830,"Harry's head hung down and his shoulders were bent. Their shadows were long and black on the dusty road, for it was late afternoon. 'Listen here,' he said.",0
6831,'Yeah.'  'We got to understand this. We got to. Do you--any?'  'I don't know.,0
6832,I reckon not. '  'Listen here. We got to do something. Let's sit down. ',0
6833,"They dropped the bicycles and sat by a ditch beside the road. They sat far apart from each other. The late sun burned down on their heads and there were brown, crumbly ant beds all around them.",0
6834,"'We got to understand this,' Harry said. He cried. He sat very still and the tears rolled down his white face. She could not think about the thing that made him cry. An ant stung her on the ankle and she picked it up in her fingers and looked at it very close.",0
6835,"'It's this way,' he said. 'I never had even kissed a girl before. '",0
6836,'Me neither. I never kissed any boy. Out of the family.',0
6837,'That's all I used to think about--was to kiss this certain girl. I used to plan about it during school and dream about it at night. And then once she gave me a date. And I could tell she meant for me to kiss her. And I just looked at her in the dark and I couldn't. That was all I had thought about--to kiss her--and when the time came I couldn't.',0
6838,She dug a hole in the ground with her finger and buried the dead ant. 'It was all my fault. Adultery is a terrible sin any way you look at it. And you were two years younger than me and just a kid.',0
6839,"'No, I wasn't. I wasn't any kid. But now I wish I was, though.'",0
6840,'Listen here. If you think we ought to we can get married--secretly or any other way.' Mick shook her head. 'I didn't like that. I never will marry with any boy.',0
6841,'I never will marry either. I know that. And I'm not just saying so--it's true. ',0
6842,"His face scared her. His nose quivered and his bottom lip was mottled and bloody where he had bitten it. His eyes were bright and wet and scowling. His face was whiter than any face she could remember. She turned her head from him. Things would be better if only he would just quit talking. Her eyes looked slowly around her--at the streaked red-and-white clay of the ditch, at a broken whiskey bottle, at a pine tree across from them with a sign advertising for a man for county sheriff. She wanted to sit quietly for a long time and not think and not say a word.",0
6843,'I'm leaving town. I'm a good mechanic and I can get a job some other place. If I stayed home Mother could read this in my eyes.',0
6844,'Tell me. Can you look at me and see the difference?' Harry watched her face a long time and nodded that he could. Then he said:  'There's just one more thing.,0
6845,In a month or two I'll send you my address and you write and tell me for sure whether you're all right. ' 'How you mean?' she asked slowly.,0
6846,"He explained to her. 'All you need to write is ""O.K."" and then I'll know. '",0
6847,"They were walking home again, pushing the wheels. Their shadows stretched out giant-sized on the road. Harry was bent over like an old beggar and kept wiping his nose on his sleeve. For a minute there was a bright, golden glow over everything before the sun sank down behind the trees and their shadows were gone on the road before them. She felt very old, and it was like something was heavy inside her. She was a grown person now, whether she wanted to be or not.",0
6848,They had walked the sixteen miles and were in the dark alley at home. She could see the yellow light from their kitchen. Harry's house was dark--his mother had not come home. She worked for a tailor in a shop on a side street. Sometimes even on Sunday. When you looked through the window you could see her bending over the machine in the back or pushing a long needle through the heavy pieces of goods. She never looked up while you watched her. And at night she cooked these orthodox dishes for Harry and her.,0
6849,"'Listen here----' he said. She waited in the dark, but he did not finish. They shook hands with each other and Harry walked up the dark alley between the houses. When he reached the sidewalk he turned and looked back over his shoulder. A light shone on his face and it was white and hard. Then he was gone.",0
6850,"* * * * *  'This here is a riddle,' George said. 'I listening.'",0
6851,'Two Indians was walking on a trail. The one in front was the son of the one behind but the one behind was not his father. What kin was they?'  'Less see.,0
6852,"His stepfather.' George grinned at Portia with his little square, blue teeth. 'His uncle, then.'",0
6853,'You can't guess. It was his mother. The trick is that you don't think about a Indian being a lady.',0
6854,"She stood outside the room and watched them. The doorway framed the kitchen like a picture. Inside it was homey and clean. Only the light by the sink was turned on and there were shadows in the room. Bill and Hazel played blackjack at the table with matches for money. Hazel felt the braids of her hair with her plump, pink fingers while Bill sucked in his cheeks and dealt the cards in a very serious way. At the sink Portia was drying the dishes with a clean checked towel. She looked thin and her skin was golden yellow, her greased black hair slicked neat. Ralph sat quietly on the floor and George was tying a little harness on him made out of old Christmas tinsel.",0
6855,"'This here is another riddle, Portia. If the hand of a clock points to half-past two----'  She went into the room. It was like she had expected them to move back when they saw her and stand around in a circle and look. But they just glanced at her. She sat down at the table and waited.",0
6856,'Here you come traipsing in after everbody done finished supper. Seem to me like I never will get off from work. ',0
6857,Nobody noticed her. She ate a big plateful of cabbage and salmon and finished off with junket. It was her Mama she was thinking about. The door opened and her Mama came in and told Portia that Miss Brown had said she found a bedbug in her room. To get out the gasoline.,0
6858,"'Quit frowning like that, Mick. You're coming to the age where you ought to fix up and try to look the best you can. And hold on--don't barge out like that when I speak with you--I mean you to give Ralph a good sponge bath before he goes to bed. Clean his nose and ears good. '",0
6859,Ralph's soft hair was sticky with oatmeal. She wiped it with a dishrag and rinched his face and hands at the sink. Bill and Hazel finished their game. Bill's long fingernails scraped on the table as he took up the matches. George carried Ralph off to bed. She and Portia were alone in the kitchen.,0
6860,'Listen! Look at me. Do you notice anything different?',0
6861,"'Sure I notice, Hon.'  Portia put on her red hat and changed her shoes.  'Well--?' 'Just you take a little grease and rub it on your face. Your nose already done peeled very bad. They say grease is the best thing for bad sunburn.'",0
6862,"She stood by herself in the dark back yard, breaking off pieces of bark from the oak tree with her fingernails. It was almost worse this way. Maybe she would feel better if they could look at her and tell. If they knew.",0
6863,"Her Dad called her from the back steps. 'Mick! Oh, Mick!'  'Yes, sir.'  'The telephone.'",0
6864,"George crowded up close and tried to listen in, but she pushed him away. Mrs. Minowitz talked very loud and excited. 'My Harry should be home by now. You know where he is?'  'No, ma'am.'",0
6865,"'He said you two would ride out on bicycles. Where should he be now? You know where he is?'  'No, ma'am,' Mick said again.",0
6866,"[12] Now that the days were hot again the Sunny Dixie Show was always crowded. The March wind quieted. Trees were thick with their foliage of ocherous green. The sky was a cloudless blue and the rays of the sun grew stronger. The air was sultry. Jake Blount hated this weather. He thought dizzily of the long, burning summer months ahead. He did not feel well. Recently a headache had begun to trouble him constantly. He had gained weight so that his stomach developed a little pouch. He had to leave the top button of his trousers undone. He knew that this was alcoholic fat, but he kept on drinking. Liquor helped the ache in his head. He had only to take one small glass to make it better. Nowadays one glass was the same to him as a quart. It was not the liquor of the moment that gave him the kick--but the reaction of the first swallow to all the alcohol which had saturated his blood during these last months. A spoonful of beer would help the throbbing in his head, but a quart of whiskey could not make him drunk.",0
6867,"He cut out liquor entirely. For several days he drank only water and Orange Crush. The pain was like a crawling worm in his head. He worked wearily during the long afternoons and evenings. He could not sleep and it was agony to try to read. The damp, sour stink in his room infuriated him. He lay restless in the bed and when at last he fell asleep daylight had come.",0
6868,"A dream haunted him. It had first come to him four months ago. He would awake with terror--but the strange point was that never could he remember the contents of this dream. Only the feeling remained when his eyes were opened. Each time his fears at awakening were so identical that he did not doubt but what these dreams were the same. He was used to dreams, the grotesque nightmares of drink that led him down into a madman's region of disorder, but always the morning light scattered the effects of these wild dreams and he forgot them.",0
6869,"This blank, stealthy dream was of a different nature. He awoke and could remember nothing. But there was a sense of menace that lingered in him long after. Then he awoke one morning with the old fear but with a faint remembrance of the darkness behind him. He had been walking among a crowd of people and in his arms he carried something. That was all he could be sure about. Had he stolen? Had he been trying to save some possession? Was he being hunted by all these people around him? He did not think so. The more he studied this simple dream the less he could understand. Then for some time afterward the dream did not return.",0
6870,"He met the writer of signs whose chalked message he had seen the past November. From the first day of their meeting the old man clung to him like an evil genius. His name was Simms and he preached on the sidewalks. The winter cold had kept him indoors, but in the spring he was out on the streets all day. His white hair was soft and ragged on his neck and he carried around with him a woman's big silk pocketbook full of chalk and Jesus ads. His eyes were bright and crazy. Simms tried to convert him.",0
6871,"'Child of adversity, I smell the sinful stink of beer on thy breath. And you smoke cigarettes. If the Lord had wanted us to smoke cigarettes He would have said so in His Book. The mark of Satan is on thy brow. I see it. Repent. Let me show you the light. '",0
6872,"Jake rolled up his eyes and made a slow pious sign in the air. Then he opened his oil-stained hand. 'I reveal this only to you,' he said in a low stage voice. Simms looked down at the scar in his palm. Jake leaned close and whispered: 'And there's the other sign. The sign you know. For I was born with them. '",0
6873,Simms backed against the fence. With a womanish gesture he lifted a lock of silver hair from his forehead and smoothed it back on his head. Nervously his tongue licked the corners of his mouth. Jake laughed.,0
6874,'Blasphemer!' Simms screamed. 'God will get you. You and all your crew. God remembers the scoffers. He watches after me. God watches everybody but He watches me the most. Like He did Moses. God tells me things in the night. God will get you.',0
6875,He took Simms down to a corner store for Coca-Colas and peanut butter crackers. Simms began to work on him again. When he left for the show Simms ran along behind him.,0
6876,'Come to this corner tonight at seven o'clock. Jesus has a message just for you. ',0
6877,The first days of April were windy and warm. White clouds trailed across the blue sky. In the wind there was the smell of the river and also the fresher smell of fields beyond the town. The show was crowded every day from four in the afternoon until midnight. The crowd was a tough one. With the new spring he felt an undertone of trouble.,0
6878,"One night he was working on the machinery of the swings when suddenly he was roused from thought by the sounds of angry voices. Quickly he pushed through the crowd until he saw a white girl fighting with a colored girl by the ticket booth of the flying-jinny. He wrenched them apart, but still they struggled to get at each other. The crowd took sides and there was a bedlam of noise. The white girl was a hunchback. She held something tight in her hand.",0
6879,"'I seen you,' the colored girl yelled. 'I ghy beat that hunch off your back, too.' 'Hush your mouth, you black nigger!'  'Low-down factory tag.",0
6880,"I done paid my money and I ghy ride. White man, you make her give me back my ticket.' 'Black nigger slut!'",0
6881,Jake looked from one to the other. The crowd pressed close. There were mumbled opinions on every side.,0
6882,"'I seen Lurie drop her ticket and I watched this here white lady pick it up. That the truth,' a colored boy said. 'No nigger going to put her hands on no white girl while----'  'You quit that pushing me.",0
6883,I ready to hit back even if your skin do be white.' Roughly Jake pushed into the thick of the crowd. 'All right!' he yelled. 'Move on--break it up. Every damn one of you.' There was something about the size of his fists that made the people drift sullenly away. Jake turned back to the two girls.,0
6884,"'This here the way it is,' said the colored girl. 'I bet I one of the few peoples here who done saved over fifty cents till Friday night. I done ironed double this week. I done paid a good nickel for that ticket she holding. And now I means to ride.'",0
6885,Jake settled the trouble quickly. He let the hunchback keep the disputed ticket and issued another one to the colored girl. For the rest of that evening there were no more quarrels. But Jake moved alertly through the crowd. He was troubled and uneasy.,0
6886,"In addition to himself there were five other employees at the show--two men to operate the swings and take tickets and three girls to manage the booths. This did not count Patterson. The show-owner spent most of his time playing cards with himself in his trailer. His eyes were dull, with the pupils shrunken, and the skin of his neck hung in yellow, pulpy folds. During the past few months Jake had had two raises in pay. At midnight it was his job to report to Patterson and hand over the takings of the evening. Sometimes Patterson did not notice him until he had been in the trailer for several minutes; he would be staring at the cards, sunk in a stupor. The air of the trailer was heavy with the stinks of food and reefers. Patterson held his hand over his stomach as though protecting it from something. He always checked over the accounts very thoroughly.",0
6887,"Jake and the two operators had a squabble. These men were both former doffers at one of the mills. At first he had tried to talk to them and help them to see the truth. Once he invited them to a pool room for a drink. But they were so dumb he couldn't help them. Soon after this he overheard the conversation between them that caused the trouble. It was an early Sunday morning, almost two o'clock, and he had been checking the accounts with Patterson. When he stepped out of the trailer the grounds seemed empty. The moon was bright. He was thinking of Singer and the free day ahead. Then as he passed by the swings he heard someone speak his name. The two operators had finished work and were smoking together. Jake listened.",0
6888,"'If there's anything I hate worse than a nigger it's a Red.' 'He tickles me. I don't pay him no mind. The way he struts around. I never seen such a sawed-off runt. How tall is he, you reckon?'  'Around five foot.",0
6889,But he thinks he got to tell everybody so much. He oughta be in jail. That's where. The Red Bolshivik.',0
6890,'He just tickles me. I can't look at him without laughing.' 'He needn't act biggity with me.',0
6891,"Jake watched them follow the path toward Weavers Lane. His first thought was to rush out and confront them, but a certain shrinking held him back. For several days he fumed in silence. Then one night after work he followed the two men for several blocks and as they turned a corner he cut in front of them.",0
6892,"'I heard you,' he said breathlessly. 'It so happened I heard every word you said last Saturday night. Sure I'm a Red. At least I reckon I am. But what are you?' They stood beneath a street light. The two men stepped back from him. The neighborhood was deserted. 'You pasty-faced, shrunk-gutted, ricket-ridden little rats! I could reach out and choke your stringy necks--one to each hand. Runt or no, I could lay you on this sidewalk where they'd have to scrape you up with shovels.'",0
6893,"The two men looked at each other, cowed, and tried to walk on. But Jake would not let them pass. He kept step with them, walking backward, a furious sneer on his face.",0
6894,"'All I got to say is this: In the future I suggest you come to me whenever you feel the need to make remarks about my height, weight, accent, demeanor, or ideology. And that last is not what I take a leak with either--case you don't know. We will discuss it together. '",0
6895,Afterward Jake treated the two men with angry contempt. Behind his back they jeered at him. One afternoon he found that the engine of the swings had been deliberately damaged and he had to work three hours overtime to fix it. Always he felt someone was laughing at him. Each time he heard the girls talking together he drew himself up straight and laughed carelessly aloud to himself as though thinking of some private joke.,0
6896,"The warm southwest winds from the Gulf of Mexico were heavy with the smells of spring. The days grew longer and the sun was bright. The lazy warmth depressed him. He began to drink again. As soon as work was done he went home and lay down on his bed. Sometimes he stayed there, fully clothed and inert, for twelve or thirteen hours. The restlessness that had caused him to sob and bite his nails only a few months before seemed to have gone. And yet beneath his inertia Jake felt the old tension. Of all the places he had been this was the loneliest town of all. Or it would be without Singer. Only he and Singer understood the truth. He knew and could not get the don't-knows to see. It was like trying to fight darkness or heat or a stink in the air. He stared morosely out of his window. A stunted, smoke-blackened tree at the corner had put out new leaves of a bilious green. The sky was always a deep, hard blue. The mosquitoes from a fetid stream that ran through this part of the town buzzed in the room.",0
6897,He caught the itch. He mixed some sulphur and hog fat and greased his body every morning. He clawed himself raw and it seemed that the itching would never be soothed. One night he broke loose. He had been sitting alone for many hours. He had mixed gin and whiskey and was very drunk. It was almost morning. He leaned out of the window and looked at the dark silent street. He thought of all the people around him. Sleeping. The don't-knows. Suddenly he bawled out in a loud voice: 'This is the truth! You bastards don't know anything. You don't know. You don't know!',0
6898,The street awoke angrily. Lamps were lighted and sleepy curses were called to him. The men who lived in the house rattled furiously on his door. The girls from a cat-house across the street stuck their heads out of the windows.,0
6899,'You dumb dumb dumb dumb bastards. You dumb dumb dumb dumb----'  'Shuddup! Shuddup!',0
6900,The fellows in the hall were pushing against the door: 'You drunk bull! You'll be a sight dumber when we get thru with you. ',0
6901,"'How many out there?' Jake roared. He banged an empty bottle on the windowsill. 'Come on, everybody. Come one, come all. I'll settle you three at a time. '",0
6902,"'That's right, Honey,' a whore called. The door was giving way. Jake jumped from the window and ran through a side alley. 'Hee-haw! Hee-haw!' he yelled drunkenly. He was barefooted and shirtless. An hour later he stumbled into Singer's room. He sprawled on the floor and laughed himself to sleep.",0
6903,"On an April morning he found the body of a man who had been murdered. A young Negro. Jake found him in a ditch about thirty yards from the showgrounds. The Negro's throat had been slashed so that the head was rolled back at a crazy angle. The sun shone hot on his open, glassy eyes and flies hovered over the dried blood that covered his chest. The dead man held a red-and-yellow cane with a tassel like the ones sold at the hamburger booth at the show. Jake stared gloomily down at the body for some time. Then he called the police. No clues were found. Two days later the family of the dead man claimed his body at the morgue.",0
6904,"At the Sunny Dixie there were frequent fights and quarrels. Sometimes two friends would come to the show arm in arm, laughing and drinking--and before they left they would be struggling together in a panting rage. Jake was always alert. Beneath the gaudy gaiety of the show, the bright lights, and the lazy laughter, he felt something sullen and dangerous.",0
6905,"Through these dazed, disjointed weeks Simms nagged his footsteps constantly. The old man liked to come with a soapbox and a Bible and take a stand in the middle of the crowd to preach. He talked of the second coming of Christ. He said that the Day of Judgment would be October 2, 1951. He would point out certain drunks and scream at them in his raw, worn voice. Excitement made his mouth fill with water so that his words had a wet, gurgling sound. Once he had slipped in and set up his stand no arguments could make him budge. He made Jake a present of a Gideon Bible, and told him to pray on his knees for one hour each night and to hurl away every glass of beer or cigarette that was offered him.",0
6906,"They quarreled over walls and fences. Jake had begun to carry chalk in his pockets, also. He wrote brief sentences. He tried to word them so that a passerby would stop and ponder over the meaning. So that a man would wonder. So that a man would think. Also, he wrote short pamphlets and distributed them in the streets.",0
6907,"If it had not been for Singer, Jake knew that he would have left the town. Only on Sunday, when he was with his friend, did he feel at peace. Sometimes they would go for a walk together or play chess--but more often they spent the day quietly in Singer's room. If he wished to talk Singer was always attentive. If he sat morosely through the day the mute understood his feelings and was not surprised. It seemed to him that only Singer could help him now.",0
6908,Then one Sunday when he climbed the stairs he saw that Singer's door was open. The room was empty. He sat alone for more than two hours. At last he heard Singer's footsteps on the stairs.,0
6909,'I was wondering about you. Where you been?'  Singer smiled. He brushed off his hat with a handkerchief and put it away. Then deliberately he took his silver pencil from his pocket and leaned over the mantelpiece to write a note.,0
6910,'What you mean?' Jake asked when he read what the mute had written. 'Whose legs are cut off?',0
6911,Singer took back the note and wrote a few additional sentences. 'Huh!' Jake said. 'That don't surprise me.',0
6912,He brooded over the piece of paper and then crumpled it in his hand. The listlessness of the past month was gone and he was tense and uneasy. 'Huh!' he said again.,0
6913,"Singer put on a pot of coffee and got out his chessboard. Jake tore the note to pieces and rolled the fragments between his sweating palms. 'But something can be done about this,' he said after a while. 'You know it?'",0
6914,Singer nodded uncertainly. 'I want to see the boy and hear the whole story. When can you take me around there?',0
6915,"Singer deliberated. Then he wrote on a pad of paper, 'Tonight.' Jake held his hand to his mouth and began to walk restlessly around the room. 'We can do something.'",0
6916,"[13] Jake and Singer waited on the front porch. When they pushed the doorbell there was no sound of a ring in the darkened house. Jake knocked impatiently and pressed his nose against the screen door. Beside him Singer stood wooden and smiling, with two spots of color on his cheeks, for they had drunk a bottle of gin together. The evening was quiet and dark. Jake watched a yellow light shaft softly through the hall. And Portia opened the door for them.",0
6917,'I certainly trust you not been waiting long. So many folks been coming that us thought it wise to untach the bell. You gentlemens just let me take you hats--Father been mighty sick. ',0
6918,"Jake tiptoed heavily behind Singer down the bare, narrow hall. At the threshold of the kitchen he stopped short. The room was crowded and hot. A fire burned in the small wood stove and the windows were closed tight. Smoke mingled with a certain Negro smell. The glow from the stove was the only light in the room. The dark voices he had heard back in the hall were silent.",0
6919,"'These here are two white gentlemens come to inquire about Father,' Portia said. 'I think maybe he be able to see you but I better go on in first and prepare him. '",0
6920,"Jake fingered his thick lower lip. On the end of his nose there was a latticed impression from the front screen door. 'That's not it,' he said. 'I come to talk with your brother.'",0
6921,The Negroes in the room were standing. Singer motioned to them to be seated again. Two grizzled old men sat down on a bench by the stove. A loose-limbed mulatto lounged against the window. On a camp cot in a corner was a boy without legs whose trousers were folded and pinned beneath his stumpy thighs.,0
6922,"'Good evening,' Jake said awkwardly. 'Your name Copeland?' The boy put his hands over the stumps of his legs and shrank back close to the wall. ' My name Willie.'",0
6923,"'Honey, don't you worry none,' said Portia. ' This here is Mr. Singer that you heard Father speak about. And this other white gentleman is Mr. Blount and he a very close friend of Mr. Singer. They just kindly come to inquire about us in our trouble.' She turned to Jake and motioned to the three other people in the room. 'This other boy leaning on the window is my brother too. Named Buddy. And these here over by the stove is two dear friends of my Father. Named Mr. Marshall Nicolls and Mr. John Roberts. I think it a good idea to understand who all is in a room with you. '",0
6924,"'Thanks,' Jake said. He turned to Willie again. 'I just want you to tell me about it so I can get it straight in my mind. '",0
6925,"'This the way it is,' Willie said. 'I feel like my feets is still hurting. I got this here terrible misery down in my toes. Yet the hurt in my feets is down where my feets should be if they were on my l-l-legs. And not where my feets is now. It a hard thing to understand. My feets hurt me so bad all the time and I don't know where they is. They never given them back to me. They s-somewhere more than a hundred m-miles from here. '",0
6926,"'I mean about how it all happened,' Jake said. Uneasily Willie looked up at his sister. 'I don't remember--very good. '",0
6927,"'Course you remember, Honey. You done already told us over and over.' 'Well----' The boy's voice was timid and sullen. 'Us were all out on the road and this here Buster say something to the guard. The w-white man taken a stick to him. Then this other boy he tries to run off. And I follow him. It all come about so quick I don't remember good just how it were. Then they taken us back to the camp and----'  'I know the rest,' Jake said.",0
6928,"'But give me the names and addresses of the other two boys. And tell me the names of the guards.'  'Listen here, white man. It seem to me like you meaning to get me into trouble. '  'Trouble!'",0
6929,"Jake said rudely. 'What in the name of Christ do you think you're in now?'  'Less us quiet down,' Portia said nervously. ' This here the way it is, Mr. Blount. They done let Willie off at the camp before his time were served. But they done also impressed it on him not to-- I believe you understand what us means. Naturally Willie he scared. Naturally us means to be careful--'cause that the best thing us can do. We already got enough trouble as is.'",0
6930,'What happened to the guards?'  'Them w-white men were fired. That what they told me.' 'And where are your friends now?'  'What friends?',0
6931,"'Why, the other two boys.'  'They n-not my friends,' Willie said. 'Us all has had a big falling out.' 'How you mean?'",0
6932,"Portia pulled her earrings so that the lobes of her ears stretched out like rubber. ' This here what Willie means. You see, during them three days when they hurt so bad they commenced to quarrel. Willie don't ever want to see any of them again. That one thing Father and Willie done argued about already. This here Buster----'  'Buster got a wooden leg,' said the boy by the window.",0
6933,'I seen him on the street today. ' 'This here Buster don't have no folks and it were Father's idea to have him move on in with us. Father want to round up all the boys together. How he reckons us can feed them I sure don't know. ',0
6934,"'That ain't a good idea. And besides us was never very good friends anyway.' Willie felt the stumps of his legs with his dark, strong hands. 'I just wish I knowed where my f-f-feets are. That the main thing worries me. The doctor never given them back to me. I sure do wish I knowed where they are. '",0
6935,"Jake looked around him with dazed, gin-clouded eyes. Everything seemed unclear and strange. The heat in the kitchen dizzied him so that voices echoed in his ears. The smoke choked him. The light hanging from the ceiling was turned on but, as the bulb was wrapped in newspaper to dim its strength, most of the light came from between the chinks of the hot stove. There was a red glow on all the dark faces around him. He felt uneasy and alone. Singer had left the room to visit Portia's father. Jake wanted him to come back so that they could leave. He walked awkwardly across the floor and sat down on the bench between Marshall Nicolls and John Roberts.",0
6936,"'Where is Portia's father?' he asked. 'Doctor Copeland is in the front room, sir,' said Roberts.",0
6937,"'Is he a doctor?'  'Yes, sir. He is a medical doctor. '",0
6938,"There was a scuffle on the steps outside and the back door opened. A warm, fresh breeze lightened the heavy air. First a tall boy dressed in a linen suit and gilded shoes entered the room with a sack in his arms. Behind him came a young boy of about seventeen.",0
6939,"'Hey, Highboy. Hey there, Lancy,' Willie said. 'What you all brought me?'",0
6940,"Highboy bowed elaborately to Jake and placed on the table two fruit jars of wine. Lancy put beside them a plate covered with a fresh white napkin. 'This here wine is a present from the Society,' Highboy said. ' And Lancy's mother sent some peach puffs.'",0
6941,"'How is the Doctor, Miss Portia?' Lancy asked. 'Honey, he been mighty sick these days. What worries me is he so strong. It a bad sign when a person sick as he is suddenly come to be so strong.' Portia turned to Jake. 'Don't you think it a bad sign, Mr. Blount?'",0
6942,Jake stared at her dazedly. 'I don't know. ',0
6943,"Lancy glanced sullenly at Jake and pulled down the cuffs of his outgrown shirt. 'Give the Doctor my family's regards.'  'Us certainly do appreciate this,' Portia said. 'Father was speaking of you just the other day. He haves a book he wants to give you. Wait just one minute while I get it and rinch out this plate to return to your Mother. This were certainly a kindly thing for her to do.'",0
6944,"Marshall Nicolls leaned toward Jake and seemed about to speak to him. The old man wore a pair of pin-striped trousers and a morning coat with a flower in the buttonhole. He cleared his throat and said: 'Pardon me, sir--but unavoidably we overheard a part of your conversation with William regarding the trouble he is now in. Inevitably we have considered what is the best course to take.'",0
6945,"'You one of his relatives or the preacher in his church?'  'No, I am a pharmacist. And John Roberts on your left is employed in the postal department of the government. '",0
6946,"'A postman,' repeated John Roberts. 'With your permission----' Marshall Nicolls took a yellow silk handkerchief from his pocket and gingerly blew his nose. 'Naturally we have discussed this matter extensively. And without doubt as members of the colored race here in this free country of America we are anxious to do our part toward extending amicable relationships.'",0
6947,"'We wish always to do the right thing,' said John Roberts. 'And it behooves us to strive with care and not endanger this amicable relationship already established. Then by gradual means a better condition will come about.'",0
6948,Jake turned from one to the other. 'I don't seem to follow you.' The heat was suffocating him. He wanted to get out. A film seemed to have settled over his eyeballs so that all the faces around him were blurred.,0
6949,"Across the room Willie was playing his harp. Buddy and Highboy were listening. The music was dark and sad. When the song was finished Willie polished his harp on the front of his shirt. 'I so hungry and thirsty the slobber in my mouth done wet out the tune. I certainly will be glad to taste some of that boogie-woogie. To have something good to drink is the only thing m-made me forget this misery. If I just knowed where my f-feets are now and could drink a glass of gin ever night I wouldn't mind so much. '  'Don't fret, Hon.",0
6950,"You going to have something,' Portia said. ' Mr. Blount, would you care to take a peach puff and a glass of wine?'  'Thanks,' Jake said.",0
6951,'That would be good. ' Quickly Portia laid a cloth on the table and set down one plate and a fork. She poured a large tumblerful of the wine. 'You just make yourself comfortable here. And if you don't mind I going to serve the others.',0
6952,The fruit jars were passed from mouth to mouth. Before Highboy passed a jar to Willie he borrowed Portia's lipstick and drew a red line to set the boundary of the drink. There were gurgling noises and laughter. Jake finished his puff and carried his glass back with him to his place between the two old men. The home-made wine was rich and strong as brandy. Willie started a low dolorous tune on his harp. Portia snapped her fingers and shuffled around the room.,0
6953,"Jake turned to Marshall Nicolls. 'You say Portia's father is a doctor?'  ' Yes, sir. Yes, indeed. A skilled doctor.'",0
6954,"'What's the matter with him?' The two Negroes glanced warily at each other. 'He were in an accident,' said John Roberts.",0
6955,"'What kind of an accident?'  'A bad one. A deplorable one.' Marshall Nicolls folded and unfolded his silk handkerchief. 'As we were remarking a while ago, it is important not to impair these amicable relations but to promote them in all ways earnestly possible. We members of the colored race must strive in all ways to uplift our citizens. The Doctor in yonder has strived in every way. But sometimes it has seemed to me like he had not recognized fully enough certain elements of the different races and the situation.'",0
6956,"Impatiently Jake gulped down the last swallows of his wine. 'Christ' sake, man, speak out plain, because I can't understand a thing you say. '",0
6957,"Marshall Nicolls and John Roberts exchanged a hurt look. Across the room Willie still sat playing music. His lips crawled over the square holes of the harmonica like fat, puckered caterpillars. His shoulders were broad and strong. The stumps of his thighs jerked in time to the music. Highboy danced while Buddy and Portia clapped out the rhythm.",0
6958,"Jake stood up, and once on his feet he realized that he was drunk. He staggered and then glanced vindictively around him, but no one seemed to have noticed. 'Where's Singer?' he asked Portia thickly.",0
6959,"The music stopped. 'Why, Mr. Blount, I thought you knowed he was gone. While you were sitting at the table with your peach puff he come to the doorway and held out his watch to show it were time for him to go. You looked straight at him and shaken your head. I thought you knowed that. '",0
6960,'Maybe I was thinking about something else.' He turned to Willie and said angrily to him: 'I never did even get to tell you what I come for. I didn't come to ask you to do anything. All I wanted--all I wanted was this. You and the other boys were to testify what happened and I was to explain why. Why is the only important thing--not what. I would have pushed you all around in a wagon and you would have told your story and afterward I would have explained why. And maybe it might have meant something. Maybe it----'  He felt they were laughing at him.,0
6961,"Confusion caused him to forget what he had meant to say. The room was full of dark, strange faces and the air was too thick to breathe. He saw a door and staggered across to it. He was in a dark closet smelling of medicine. Then his hand was turning another doorknob.",0
6962,"He stood on the threshold of a small white room furnished only with an iron bed, a cabinet, and two chairs. On the bed lay the terrible Negro he had met on the stairs at Singer's house. His face was very black against the white, stiff pillows. The dark eyes were hot with hatred but the heavy, bluish lips were composed. His face was motionless as a black mask except for the slow, wide flutters of his nostrils with each breath.",0
6963,"'Get out,' the Negro said. 'Wait----' Jake said helplessly. 'Why do you say that?'",0
6964,'This is my house. ' Jake could not draw his eyes away from the Negro's terrible face. ' But why?'  'You are a white man and a stranger.,0
6965,' Jake did not leave. He walked with cumbersome caution to one of the straight white chairs and seated himself. The Negro moved his hands on the counterpane. His black eyes glittered with fever. Jake watched him. They waited. In the room there was a feeling tense as conspiracy or as the deadly quiet before an explosion.,0
6966,"* * * * *  It was long past midnight. The warm, dark air of the spring morning swirled the blue layers of smoke in the room. On the floor were crumpled balls of paper and a half-empty bottle of gin. Scattered ashes were gray on the counterpane. Doctor Copeland pressed his head tensely into the pillow. He had removed his dressing-gown and the sleeves of his white cotton nightshirt were rolled to the elbow. Jake leaned forward in his chair. His tie was loosened and the collar of his shirt had wilted with sweat. Through the hours there had grown between them a long, exhausting dialogue. And now a pause had come.",0
6967,"'So the time is ready for----' Jake began. But Doctor Copeland interrupted him. ' Now it is perhaps necessary that we----' he murmured huskily. They halted. Each looked into the eyes of the other and waited. 'I beg your pardon,' Doctor Copeland said.",0
6968,"'Sorry,' said Jake. 'Go on.' 'No, you continue.' 'Well----' Jake said. 'I won't say what I started to say. Instead we'll have one last word about the South. The strangled South. The wasted South. The slavish South.'  'And the Negro people.'",0
6969,"To steady himself Jake swallowed a long, burning draught from the bottle on the floor beside him. Then deliberately he walked to the cabinet and picked up a small, cheap globe of the world that served as a paperweight. Slowly he turned the sphere in his hands. 'All I can say is this: The world is full of meanness and evil. Huh! Three fourths of this globe is in a state of war or oppression. The liars and fiends are united and the men who know are isolated and without defense. But! But if you was to ask me to point out the most uncivilized area on the face of this globe I would point here----'  'Watch sharp,' said Doctor Copeland.",0
6970,"'You're out in the ocean. ' Jake turned the globe again and pressed his blunt, grimy thumb on a carefully selected spot. ' Here. These thirteen states. I know what I'm talking about. I read books and I go around. I been in every damn one of these thirteen states. I've worked in every one. And the reason I think like I do is this: We live in the richest country in the world. There's plenty and to spare for no man, woman, or child to be in want. And in addition to this our country was founded on what should have been a great, true principle--the freedom, equality, and rights of each individual. Huh! And what has come of that start? There are corporations worth billions of dollars--and hundreds of thousands of people who don't get to eat. And here in these thirteen states the exploitation of human beings is so that--that it's a thing you got to take in with your own eyes. In my life I seen things that would make a man go crazy. At least one third of all Southerners live and die no better off than the lowest peasant in any European Fascist state. The average wage of a worker on a tenant farm in only seventy-three dollars per year. And mind you, that's the average! The wages of sharecroppers run from thirty-five to ninety dollars per person. And thirty-five dollars a year means just about ten cents for a full day's work. Everywhere there's pellagra and hookworm and anemia. And just plain, pure starvation. But!' Jake rubbed his lips with the knuckles of his dirty fist. Sweat stood out on his forehead. 'But!' he repeated. 'Those are only the evils you can see and touch. The other things are worse. I'm talking about the way that the truth has been hidden from the people. The things they have been told so they can't see the truth. The poisonous lies. So they aren't allowed to know. '",0
6971,"'And the Negro,' said Doctor Copeland. 'To understand what is happening to us you have to----'  Jake interrupted him savagely. 'Who owns the South? Corporations in the North own three fourths of all the South. They say the old cow grazes all over--in the south, the west, the north, and the east. But she's milked in just one place. Her old teats swing over just one spot when she's full. She grazes everywhere and is milked in New York. Take our cotton mills, our pulp mills, our harness factories, our mattress factories. The North owns them. And what happens?' Jake's mustache quivered angrily. 'Here's an example. Locale, a mill village according to the great paternal system of American industry. Absentee ownership. In the village is one huge brick mill and maybe four or five hundred shanties. The houses aren't fit for human beings to live in. Moreover, the houses were built to be nothing but slums in the first place. These shanties are nothing but two or maybe three rooms and a privy--built with far less forethought than barns to house cattle. Built with far less attention to needs than sties for pigs. For under this system pigs are valuable and men are not. You can't make pork chops and sausage out of skinny little mill kids. You can't sell but half the people these days. But a pig----'  'Hold on!'",0
6972,"said Doctor Copeland. 'You are getting off on a tangent. And besides, you are giving no attention to the very separate question of the Negro. I cannot get a word in edgeways. We have been over all this before, but it is impossible to see the full situation without including us Negroes.'  'Back to our mill village,' Jake said.",0
6973,' A young linthead begins working at the fine wage of eight or ten dollars a week at such times as he can get himself employed. He marries. After the first child the woman must work in the mill also. Their combined wages come to say eighteen dollars a week when they both got work. Huh! They pay a fourth of this for the shack the mill provides them. They buy food and clothes at a company-owned or dominated store. The store overcharges on every item. With three or four younguns they are held down the same as if they had on chains. That is the whole principle of serfdom. Yet here in America we call ourselves free. And the funny thing is that this has been drilled into the heads of sharecroppers and lintheads and all the rest so hard that they really believe it. But it's taken a hell of a lot of lies to keep them from knowing.',0
6974,'There is only one way out----' said Doctor Copeland. 'Two ways. And only two ways. Once there was a time when this country was expanding. Every man thought he had a chance. Huh! But that period has gone--and gone for good. Less than a hundred corporations have swallowed all but a few leavings. These industries have already sucked the blood and softened the bones of the people. The old days of expansion are gone. The whole system of capitalistic democracy is--rotten and corrupt. There remain only two roads ahead. One: Fascism. Two: reform of the most revolutionary and permanent kind.'  'And the Negro.,0
6975,"Do not forget the Negro. So far as I and my people are concerned the South is Fascist now and always has been.' 'Yeah.'  'The Nazis rob the Jews of their legal, economic, and cultural life.",0
6976,"Here the Negro has always been deprived of these. And if wholesale and dramatic robbery of money and goods has not taken place here as in Germany, it is simply because the Negro has never been allowed to accrue wealth in the first place. '",0
6977,"'That's the system,' Jake said. 'The Jew and the Negro,' said Doctor Copeland bitterly. 'The history of my people will be commensurate with the interminable history of the Jew--only bloodier and more violent. Like a certain species of sea gull. If you capture one of the birds and tie a red string of twine around his leg the rest of the flock will peck him to death. '",0
6978,"Doctor Copeland took off his spectacles and rebound a wire around a broken hinge. Then he polished the lenses on his nightshirt. His hand shook with agitation. 'Mr. Singer is a Jew.'  'No, you're wrong there.'",0
6979,"'But I am positive that he is. The name, Singer. I recognized his race the first time I saw him. From his eyes. Besides, he told me so.'",0
6980,"'Why, he couldn't have,' Jake insisted. 'He's pure Anglo-Saxon if I ever saw it. Irish and Anglo-Saxon.'",0
6981,"'But----'  'I'm certain. Absolutely.'  'Very well,' said Doctor Copeland. 'We will not quarrel.'  Outside the dark air had cooled so that there was a chill in the room.",0
6982,"It was almost dawn. The early morning sky was deep, silky blue and the moon had turned from silver to white. All was still. The only sound was the clear, lonely song of a spring bird in the darkness outside. Though a faint breeze blew in from the window the air in the room was sour and close. There was a feeling both of tenseness and exhaustion. Doctor Copeland leaned forward from the pillow. His eyes were bloodshot and his hands clutched the counterpane. The neck of his nightshirt had slipped down over his bony shoulder. Jake's heels were balanced on the rungs of his chair and his giant hands folded between his knees in a waiting and childlike attitude. Deep black circles were beneath his eyes, his hair was unkempt. They looked at each other and waited. As the silence grew longer the tenseness between them became more strained.",0
6983,At last Doctor Copeland cleared his throat and said: 'I am certain you did not come here for nothing. I am sure we have not discussed these subjects all through the night to no purpose. We have talked of everything now except the most vital subject of all--the way out. What must be done. ',0
6984,They still watched each other and waited. In the face of each there was expectation. Doctor Copeland sat bolt upright against the pillows. Jake rested his chin in his hand and leaned forward. The pause continued. And then hesitantly they began to speak at the same time.,0
6985,"'Excuse me,' Jake said. 'Go ahead. '",0
6986,"'No, you. You started first. '  'Go on.'  'Pshaw!'",0
6987,"said Doctor Copeland. 'Continue.' Jake stared at him with clouded, mystical eyes. 'It's this way. This is how I see it. The only solution is for the people to know. Once they know the truth they can be oppressed no longer. Once just half of them know the whole fight is won.'",0
6988,"'Yes, once they understand the workings of this society. But how do you propose to tell them?'  'Listen,' Jake said. Think about chain letters. If one person sends a letter to ten people and then each of the ten people send letters to ten more--you get it?' He faltered. 'Not that I write letters, but the idea is the same. I just go around telling. And if in one town I can show the truth to just ten of the don't-knows, then I feel like some good has been done. See?'  Doctor Copeland looked at Jake in surprise.",0
6989,Then he snorted. 'Do not be childish. You cannot just go about talking. Chain letters indeed! Knows and don't-knows!',0
6990,Jake's lips trembled and his brow lowered with quick anger. ' O.K. What have you got to offer?',0
6991,'I will say first that I used to feel somewhat as you do on this question. But I have learned what a mistake that attitude is. For half a century I thought it wise to be patient.',0
6992,'I didn't say be patient.' 'In the face of brutality I was prudent. Before injustice I held my peace. I sacrificed the things in hand for the good of the hypothetical whole. I believed in the tongue instead of the fist. As an armor against oppression I taught patience and faith in the human soul. I know now how wrong I was. I have been a traitor to myself and to my people. All that is rot. Now is the time to act and to act quickly. Fight cunning with cunning and might with might. ',0
6993,"'But how?' Jake asked. 'How?'  'Why, by getting out and doing things.",0
6994,"By calling crowds of people together and getting them to demonstrate.'  'Huh! That last phrase gives you away--""getting them to demonstrate. What good will it do if you get them to demonstrate against a thing if they don't know? You're trying to stuff the hog by way of his ass.'",0
6995,"'Such vulgar expressions annoy me,' Doctor Copeland said prudishly. 'For Christ' sake! I don't care if they annoy you or not. '",0
6996,"Doctor Copeland held up his hand. 'Let us not get so overheated,' he said. 'Let us attempt to see eye to eye with each other. '",0
6997,'Suits me. I don't want to fight with you. ',0
6998,They were silent. Doctor Copeland moved his eyes from one corner of the ceiling to the other. Several times he wet his lips to speak and each time the word remained half-formed and silent in his mouth. Then at last he said: 'My advice to you is this. Do not attempt to stand alone. ',0
6999,"'But----'  'But, nothing,' said Doctor Copeland didactically. 'The most fatal thing a man can do is try to stand alone. '",0
7000,"'I see what you're getting at.'  Doctor Copeland pulled the neck of his nightshirt up over his bony shoulder and held it gathered tight to his throat. 'You believe in the struggle of my people for their human rights?' The Doctor's agitation and his mild and husky question made Jake's eyes brim suddenly with tears. A quick, swollen rush of love caused him to grasp the black, bony hand on the counterpane and hold it fast. 'Sure,' he said.",0
7001,'The extremity of our need?'  'Yes.' 'The lack of justice? The bitter inequality?'  Doctor Copeland coughed and spat into one of the squares of paper which he kept beneath his pillow.,0
7002,"'I have a program. It is a very simple, concentrated plan. I mean to focus on only one objective. In August of this year I plan to lead more than one thousand Negroes in this county on a march. A march to Washington. All of us together in one solid body. If you will look in the cabinet yonder you will see a stack of letters which I have written this week and will deliver personally.' Doctor Copeland slid his nervous hands up and down the sides of the narrow bed. 'You remember what I said to you a short while ago? You will recall that my only advice to you was: Do not attempt to stand alone. '",0
7003,"'I get it,' Jake said. 'But once you enter this it must be all. First and foremost. Your work now and forever. You must give of your whole self without stint, without hope of personal return, without rest or hope of rest. '",0
7004,'For the rights of the Negro in the South.'  'In the South and here in this very county. And it must be either all or nothing. Either yes or no.',0
7005,"Doctor Copeland leaned back on the pillow. Only his eyes seemed alive. They burned in his face like red coals. The fever made his cheekbones a ghastly purple. Jake scowled and pressed his knuckles to his soft, wide, trembling mouth. Color rushed to his face. Outside the first pale light of morning had come. The electric bulb suspended from the ceiling burned with ugly sharpness in the dawn.",0
7006,"Jake rose to his feet and stood stiffly at the foot of the bed. He said flatly: 'No. That's not the right angle at all. I'm dead sure it's not. In the first place, you'd never get out of town. They'd break it up by saying it's a menace to public health--or some such trumped-up reason. They'd arrest you and nothing would come of it. But even if by some miracle you got to Washington it wouldn't do any good. Why, the whole notion is crazy. '",0
7007,"The sharp rattle of phlegm sounded in Doctor Copeland's throat. His voice was harsh. 'As you are so quick to sneer and condemn, what do you have to offer instead?'",0
7008,"'I didn't sneer,' Jake said. 'I only remarked that your plan is crazy. I come here tonight with an idea much better than that. I wanted your son, Willie, and the other two boys to let me push them around in a wagon. They were to tell what happened to them and afterward I was to tell why. In other words, I was to give a talk on the dialectics of capitalism--and show up all of its lies. I would explain so that everyone would understand why those boys' legs were cut off. And make everyone who saw them know. '",0
7009,'Pshaw! Double pshaw!' said Doctor Copeland furiously. 'I do not believe you have good sense. If I were a man who felt it worth my while to laugh I would surely laugh at that. Never have I had the opportunity to hear of such nonsense first hand. ',0
7010,They stared at each other in bitter disappointment and anger. There was the rattle of a wagon in the street outside. Jake swallowed and bit his lips. 'Huh!' he said finally. 'You're the only one who's crazy. You got everything exactly backward. The only way to solve the Negro problem under capitalism is to geld every one of the fifteen million black men in these states. ',0
7011,"'So that is the kind of idea you harbor beneath your ranting about justice. ' 'I didn't say it should be done. I only said you couldn't see the forest for the trees.' Jake spoke with slow and painful care. 'The work has to start at the bottom. The old traditions smashed and the new ones created. To forge a whole new pattern for the world. To make man a social creature for the first time, living in an orderly and controlled society where he is not forced to be unjust in order to survive. A social tradition in which----'  Doctor Copeland clapped ironically.",0
7012,"'Very good,' he said. ' But the cotton must be picked before the cloth is made. You and your crackpot do-nothing theories can----'  'Hush!",0
7013,"Who cares whether you and your thousand Negroes straggle up to that stinking cesspool of a place called Washington? What difference does it make? What do a few people matter--a few thousand people, black, white, good or bad? When the whole of our society is built on a foundation of black lies. '",0
7014,"'Everything!' Doctor Copeland panted. 'Everything! Everything!'  'Nothing!'  'The soul of the meanest and most evil of us on this earth is worth more in the sight of justice than----'  'Oh, the Hell with it!' Jake said. 'Balls!'  'Blasphemer!' screamed Doctor Copeland.",0
7015,'Foul blasphemer!' Jake shook the iron bars of the bed. The vein in his forehead swelled to the point of bursting and his face was dark with rage. 'Short-sighted bigot!'  'White----' Doctor Copeland's voice failed him.,0
7016,"He struggled and no sound would come. At last he was able to bring forth a choked whisper: 'Fiend.' The bright yellow morning was at the window. Doctor Copeland's head fell back on the pillow. His neck twisted at a broken angle, a fleck of bloody foam on his lips. Jake looked at him once before, sobbing with violence, he rushed headlong from the room.",0
7017,"[14] Now she could not stay in the inside room. She had to be around somebody all the time. Doing something every minute. And if she was by herself she counted or figured with numbers. She counted all the roses on the living-room wallpaper. She figured out the cubic area of the whole house. She counted every blade of grass in the back yard and every leaf on a certain bush. Because if she did not have her mind on numbers this terrible afraidness came in her. She would be walking home from school on these May afternoons and suddenly she would have to think of something quick. A good thing--very good. Maybe she would think about a phrase of hurrying jazz music. Or that a bowl of jello would be in the refrigerator when she got home. Or plan to smoke a cigarette behind the coal house. Maybe she would try to think a long way ahead to the time when she would go north and see snow, or even travel somewhere in a foreign land. But these thoughts about good things wouldn't last. The jello was gone in five minutes and the cigarette smoked. Then what was there after that? And the numbers mixed themselves up in her brain. And the snow and the foreign land were a long, long time away. Then what was there?",0
7018,Just Mister Singer. She wanted to follow him everywhere. In the morning she would watch him go down the front steps to work and then follow along a half a block behind him. Every afternoon as soon as school was over she hung around at the corner near the store where he worked. At four o'clock he went out to drink a Coca-Cola. She watched him cross the street and go into the drugstore and finally come out again. She followed him home from work and sometimes even when he took walks. She always followed a long way behind him. And he did not know.,0
7019,"She would go up to see him in his room. First she scrubbed her face and hands and put some vanilla on the front of her dress. She only went to visit him twice a week now, because she didn't want him to get tired of her. Most always he would be sitting over the queer, pretty chess game when she opened the door. And then she was with him.",0
7020,"'Mister Singer, have you ever lived in a place where it snowed in the winter-time?' He tilted his chair back against the wall and nodded. 'In some different country than this one--in a foreign place?'",0
7021,"He nodded yes again and wrote on his pad with his silver pencil. Once he had traveled to Ontario, Canada--across the river from Detroit. Canada was so far in the north that the white snow drifted up to the roofs of the houses. That was where the Quints were and the St. Lawrence River. The people ran up and down the streets speaking French to each other. And far up in the north there were deep forests and white ice igloos. The arctic region with the beautiful northern lights.",0
7022,'When you was in Canada did you go out and get any fresh snow and eat it with cream and sugar? Once I read where it was mighty good to eat that way. ',0
7023,"He turned his head to one side because he didn't understand. She couldn't ask the question again because suddenly it sounded silly. She only looked at him and waited. A big, black shadow of his head was on the wall behind him. The electric fan cooled the thick, hot air. All was quiet. It was like they waited to tell each other things that had never been told before. What she had to say was terrible and afraid. But what he would tell her was so true that it would make everything all right. Maybe it was a thing that could not be spoken with words or writing. Maybe he would have to let her understand this in a different way. That was the feeling she had with him.",0
7024,"'I was just asking you about Canada--but it didn't amount to anything, Mister Singer.' Downstairs in the home rooms there was plenty of trouble. Etta was still so sick that she couldn't sleep crowded three in a bed. The shades were kept drawn and the dark room smelled bad with a sick smell. Etta's job was gone, and that meant eight dollars less a week besides the doctor's bill. Then one day when Ralph was walking around in the kitchen he burned himself on the hot kitchen stove. The bandages made his hands itch and somebody had to watch him all the time else he would bust the blisters. On George's birthday they had bought him a little red bike with a bell and a basket on the handlebars. Everybody had chipped in to give it to him. But when Etta lost her job they couldn't pay, and after two installments were past due the store sent a man out to take the wheel away. George just watched the man roll the bike off the porch, and when he passed George kicked the back fender and then went into the coal house and shut the door.",0
7025,"It was money, money, money all the time. They owed to the grocery and they owed the last payment on some furniture. And now since they had lost the house they owed money there too. The six rooms in the house were always taken, but nobody ever paid the rent on time.",0
7026,For a while their Dad went out every day to hunt another job. He couldn't do carpenter work any more because it made him jittery to be more than ten feet off the ground. He applied for many jobs but nobody would hire him. Then at last he got this notion.,0
7027,"'It's advertising, Mick,' he said. 'I've come to the conclusion that's all in the world the matter with my watch-repairing business right now. I got to sell myself. I got to get out and let people know I can fix watches, and fix them good and cheap. You just mark my words. I'm going to build up this business so I'll be able to make a good living for this family the rest of my life. Just by advertising.'",0
7028,"He brought home a dozen sheets of tin and some red paint. For the next week he was very busy. It seemed to him like this was a hell of a good idea. The signs were all over the floor of the front room. He got down on his hands and knees and took great care over the printing of each letter. As he worked he whistled and wagged his head. He hadn't been so cheerful and glad in months. Every now and then he would have to dress in his good suit and go around the corner for a glass of beer to calm himself. On the signs at first he had:  Wilbur Kelly Watch Repairing Very Cheap and Expert 'Mick, I want them to hit you right bang in the eye.",0
7029,To stand out wherever you see them. ' She helped him and he gave her three nickels. The signs were O.K. at first. Then he worked on them so much that they were ruined. He wanted to add more and more things--in the corners and at the top and bottom. Before he had finished the signs were plastered all over with 'Very Cheap' and 'Come At Once' and 'You Give Me Any Watch And I Make It Run.',0
7030,"'You tried to write so much in the signs that nobody will read anything,' she told him. He brought home some more tin and left the designing up to her. She painted them very plain, with great big block letters and a picture of a clock. Soon he had a whole stack of them. A fellow he knew rode him out in the country where he could nail them to trees and fenceposts. At both ends of the block he put up a sign with a black hand pointing toward the house. And over the front door there was another sign.",0
7031,"The day after this advertising was finished he waited in the front room dressed in a clean shirt and a tie. Nothing happened. The jeweler who gave him overflow work to do at half price sent in a couple of clocks. That was all. He took it hard. He didn't go out to look for other jobs any more, but every minute he had to be busy around the house. He took down the doors and oiled the hinges--whether they needed it or not. He mixed the margarine for Portia and scrubbed the floors upstairs. He worked out a contraption where the water from the ice box could be drained through the kitchen window. He carved some beautiful alphabet blocks for Ralph and invented a little needle-threader. Over the few watches that he had to work on he took great pains.",0
7032,"Mick still followed Mister Singer. But she didn't want to. It was like there was something wrong about her following after him without his knowing. Two or three days she played hooky from school. She walked behind him when he went to work and hung around on the corner near his store all day. When he ate his dinner at Mister Brannon's she went into the café and spent a nickel for a sack of peanuts. Then at night she followed him on these dark, long walks. She stayed on the opposite side of the street from him and about a block behind. When he stopped, she stopped also--and when he walked fast she ran to keep up with him. So long as she could see him and be near him she was right happy. But sometimes this queer feeling would come to her and she knew that she was doing wrong. So she tried hard to keep busy at home.",0
7033,"She and her Dad were alike in the way that now they always had to be fooling with something. She kept up with all that went on in the house and the neighborhood. Sparerib's big sister won fifty dollars at a movie bank night. Baby Wilson had the bandage off her head now, but her hair was cut short like a boy's. She couldn't dance in the soirée this year, and when her mother took her to see it Baby began to yell and cut up during one of the dances. They had to drag her out of the Opera House. And on the sidewalk Mrs. Wilson had to whip her to make her behave. And Mrs. Wilson cried, too. George hated Baby. He would hold his nose and stop up his ears when she passed by the house. Pete Wells ran away from home and was gone three weeks. He came back barefooted and very hungry. He bragged about how he had gone all the way to New Orleans.",0
7034,"Because of Etta, Mick still slept in the living-room. The short sofa cramped her so much that she had to make up sleep in study hall at school. Every other night Bill swapped with her and she slept with George. Then a lucky break came for them. A fellow who had a room upstairs moved away. When after a week had gone by and nobody answered the ad in the paper, their Mama told Bill he could move up to the vacant room. Bill was very pleased to have a place entirely by himself away from the family. She moved in with George. He slept like a little warm kitty and breathed very quiet.",0
7035,She knew the night-time again. But not the same as in the last summer when she walked in the dark by herself and listened to the music and made plans. She knew the night a different way now. In bed she lay awake. A queer afraidness came to her. It was like the ceiling was slowly pressing down toward her face. How would it be if the house fell apart? Once their Dad had said the whole place ought to be condemned. Did he mean that maybe some night when they were asleep the walls would crack and the house collapse? Bury them under all the plaster and broken glass and smashed furniture? So that they could not move or breathe? She lay awake and her muscles were stiff. In the night there was a creaking. Was that somebody walking--somebody else awake besides her--Mister Singer?  She never thought about Harry.,0
7036,She had made up her mind to forget him and she did forget him. He wrote that he had a job with a garage in Birmingham. She answered with a card saying 'O.K.' as they had planned. He sent his mother three dollars every week. It seemed like a very long time had passed since they went to the woods together.,0
7037,During the day she was busy in the outside room. But at night she was by herself in the dark and figuring was not enough. She wanted somebody. She tried to keep George awake. 'It sure is fun to stay awake and talk in the dark. Less us talk awhile together.',0
7038,He made a sleepy answer. 'See the stars out the window. It's a hard thing to realize that every single one of those little stars is a planet as large as the earth.',0
7039,'How do they know that?'  'They just do. They got ways of measuring. That's science. ',0
7040,"'I don't believe in it. ' She tried to egg him on to an argument so that he would get mad and stay awake. He just let her talk and didn't seem to pay attention. After a while he said:  'Look, Mick!",0
7041,"You see that branch of the tree? Don't it look like a pilgrim forefather lying down with a gun in his hand?' 'It sure does. That's exactly what it's like. And see over there on the bureau. Don't that bottle look like a funny man with a hat on?'  'Naw,' George said.",0
7042,'It don't look a bit like one to me.' She took a drink from a glass of water on the floor. ' Less me and you play a game--the name game. You can be It if you want to. Whichever you like. You can choose.',0
7043,"He put his little fists up to his face and breathed in a quiet, even way because he was falling asleep. 'Wait, George!' she said. 'This'll be fun. I'm somebody beginning with an M. Guess who I am.'",0
7044,George sighed and his voice was tired. 'Are you Harpo Marx?'  'No. I'm not even in the movies. ',0
7045,'I don't know. ' 'Sure you do. My name begins with the letter M and I live in Italy. You ought to guess this. ',0
7046,George turned over on his side and curled up in a ball. He did not answer. 'My name begins with an M but sometimes I'm called a name beginning with D. In Italy. You can guess.',0
7047,The room was quiet and dark and George was asleep. She pinched him and twisted his ear. He groaned but did not awake. She fitted in close to him and pressed her face against his hot little naked shoulder. He would sleep all through the night while she was figuring with decimals.,0
7048,"Was Mister Singer awake in his room upstairs? Did the ceiling creak because he was walking quietly up and down, drinking a cold orange crush and studying the chess men laid out on the table? Had ever he felt a terrible afraidness like this one? No. He had never done anything wrong. He had never done wrong and his heart was quiet in the night-time. Yet at the same time he would understand.",0
7049,"If only she could tell him about this, then it would be better. She thought of how she would begin to tell him. Mister Singer--I know this girl not any older than I am--Mister Singer, I don't know whether you understand a thing like this or not--Mister Singer. Mister Singer. She said his name over and over. She loved him better than anyone in the family, better even than George or her Dad. It was a different love. It was not like anything she had ever felt in her life before.",0
7050,"In the mornings she and George would dress together and talk. Sometimes she wanted very much to be close to George. He had grown taller and was pale and peaked. His soft, reddish hair lay raggedy over the tops of his little ears. His sharp eyes were always squinted so that his face had a strained look. His permanent teeth were coming in, but they were blue and far apart like his baby teeth had been. Often his jaw was crooked because he had a habit of feeling out the sore new teeth with his tongue.",0
7051,"'Listen here, George,' she said. 'Do you love me?'  'Sure. I love you O.K.'",0
7052,"It was a hot, sunny morning during the last week of school. George was dressed and he lay on the floor doing his number work. His dirty little fingers squeezed the pencil tight and he kept breaking the lead point. When he was finished she held him by the shoulders and looked hard into his face. 'I mean a lot. A whole lot.'  'Lemme go.",0
7053,Sure I love you. Ain't you my sister?'  'I know. But suppose I wasn't your sister. Would you love me then?',0
7054,George backed away. He had run out of shirts and wore a dirty pullover sweater. His wrists were thin and blue-veined. The sleeves of the sweater had stretched so that they hung loose and made his hands look very small.,0
7055,'If you wasn't my sister then I might not know you. So I couldn't love you.' ' But if you did know me and I wasn't your sister.',0
7056,'But how do you know I would? You can't prove it. ',0
7057,"'Well, just take it for granted and pretend. ' 'I reckon I would like you all right. But I still say you can't prove----'  'Prove!",0
7058,"You got that word on the brain. Prove and trick. Everything is either a trick or it's got to be proved. I can't stand you, George Kelly. I hate you. '",0
7059,'O.K. Then I don't like you none either.' He crawled down under the bed for something. 'What you want under there? You better leave my things alone. If ever I caught you meddling in my private box I'd bust your head against the side of the wall. I would. I'd stomp on your brains.',0
7060,"George came out from under the bed with his spelling book. His dirty little paw reached in a hole in the mattress where he hid his marbles. Nothing could faze that kid. He took his time about choosing three brown agates to take with him. 'Aw, shucks, Mick,' he answered her. George was too little and too tough. There wasn't any sense in loving him. He knew even less about things than she did.",0
7061,School was out and she had passed every subject--some with A plus and some by the skin of her teeth. The days were long and hot. Finally she was able to work hard at music again. She began to write down pieces for the violin and piano. She wrote songs. Always music was in her mind. She listened to Mister Singer's radio and wandered around the house thinking about the programs she had heard.,0
7062,'What ails Mick?' Portia asked. 'What kind of cat is it got her tongue? She walk around and don't say a word. She not even greedy like she used to be. She getting to be a regular lady these days. ',0
7063,It was as though in some way she was waiting--but what she waited for she did not know. The sun burned down glaring and white-hot in the streets. During the day she either worked hard at music or messed with kids. And waited. Sometimes she would look all around her quick and this panic would come in her. Then in late June there was a sudden happening so important that it changed everything.,0
7064,"That night they were all out on the porch. The twilight was blurred and soft. Supper was almost ready and the smell of cabbage floated to them from the open hall. All of them were together except Hazel, who had not come home from work, and Etta, who still lay sick in bed. Their Dad leaned back in a chair with his sock-feet on the banisters. Bill was on the steps with the kids. Their Mama sat on the swing fanning herself with the newspaper. Across the street a girl new in the neighborhood skated up and down the sidewalk on one roller skate. The lights on the block were just beginning to be turned on, and far away a man was calling someone.",0
7065,"Then Hazel came home. Her high heels clopped up the steps and she leaned back lazily on the banisters. In the half-dark her fat, soft hands were very white as she felt the back of her braided hair. 'I sure do wish Etta was able to work,' she said. 'I found out about this job today. '",0
7066,"'What kind of a job?' asked their Dad. ' Anything I could do, or just for girls?'  'Just for a girl.",0
7067,A clerk down at Woolworth's is going to get married next week. ' 'The ten-cent store----' Mick said.,0
7068,'You interested?' The question took her by surprise. She had just been thinking about a sack of wintergreen candy she had bought there the day before. She felt hot and tense. She rubbed her bangs up from her forehead and counted the first few stars.,0
7069,"Their Dad flipped his cigarette down to the sidewalk. 'No,' he said. 'We don't want Mick to take on too much responsibility at her age. Let her get her growth out. Her growth through with, anyway.'",0
7070,"'I agree with you,' Hazel said. 'I really do think it would be a mistake for Mick to have to work regular. I don't think it would be right. '",0
7071,Bill put Ralph down from his lap and shuffled his feet on the steps. 'Nobody ought to work until they're around sixteen. Mick should have two more years and finish at Vocational--if we can make it. ',0
7072,"'Even if we have to give up the house and move down in mill town,' their Mama said. 'I rather keep Mick at home for a while. '",0
7073,For a minute she had been scared they would try to corner her into taking the job. She would have said she would run away from home. But the way they took the attitude they did touched her. She felt excited. They were all talking about her--and in a kindly way. She was ashamed for the first scared feeling that had come to her. Of a sudden she loved all of the family and a tightness came in her throat.,0
7074,'About how much money is in it?' she asked. 'Ten dollars.',0
7075,"'Ten dollars a week?'  'Sure,' Hazel said. 'Did you think it would be only ten a month?'  'Portia don't make but about that much. '",0
7076,"'Oh, colored people----' Hazel said. Mick rubbed the top of her head with her fist. 'That's a whole lot of money. A good deal.'",0
7077,"'It's not to be grinned at,' Bill said. 'That's what I make.' Mick's tongue was dry. She moved it around in her mouth to gather up spit enough to talk. Ten dollars a week would buy about fifteen fried chickens. Or five pairs of shoes or five dresses. Or installments on a radio.' She thought about a piano, but she did not mention that aloud.",0
7078,"'It would tide us over,' their Mama said. ' But at the same time I rather keep Mick at home for a while. Now, when Etta----'  'Wait!'",0
7079,She felt hot and reckless. 'I want to take the job. I can hold it down. I know I can.',0
7080,"'Listen to little Mick,' Bill said. Their Dad picked his teeth with a matchstick and took his feet down from the banisters. 'Now, let's not rush into anything. I rather Mick take her time and think this out. We can get along somehow without her working. I mean to increase my watch work by sixty per cent soon as----'  'I forgot,' Hazel said.",0
7081,'I think there's a Christmas bonus every year.' Mick frowned. ' But I wouldn't be working then. I'd be in school. I just want to work during vacation and then go back to school. ',0
7082,"'Sure,' Hazel said quickly. 'But tomorrow I'll go down with you and take the job if I can get it. '",0
7083,It was as though a great worry and tightness left the family. In the dark they began to laugh and talk. Their Dad did a trick for George with a matchstick and a handkerchief. Then he gave the kid fifty cents to go down to the corner store for Coca-Colas to be drunk after supper. The smell of cabbage was stronger in the hall and pork chops were frying. Portia called. The boarders already waited at the table. Mick had supper in the dining-room. The cabbage leaves were limp and yellow on her plate and she couldn't eat. When she reached for the bread she knocked a pitcher of iced tea over the table.,0
7084,"Then later she waited on the front porch by herself for Mister Singer to come home. In a desperate way she wanted to see him. The excitement of the hour before had died down and she was sick to the stomach. She was going to work in the ten-cent store and she did not want to work there. It was like she had been trapped into something. The job wouldn't be just for the summer--but for a long time, as long a time as she could see ahead. Once they were used to the money coming in it would be impossible to do without again. That was the way things were. She stood in the dark and held tight to the banisters. A long time passed and Mister Singer still did not come. At eleven o'clock she went out to see if she could find him. But suddenly she got frightened in the dark and ran back home.",0
7085,Then in the morning she bathed and dressed very careful. Hazel and Etta loaned her the clothes to wear and primped her to look nice. She wore Hazel's green silk dress and a green hat and high-heeled pumps with silk stockings. They fixed her face with rouge and lipstick and plucked her eyebrows. She looked at least sixteen years old when they were finished.,0
7086,"It was too late to back down now. She was really grown and ready to earn her keep. Yet if she would go to her Dad and tell him how she felt he would tell her to wait a year. And Hazel and Etta and Bill and their Mama, even now, would say that she didn't have to go. But she couldn't do it. She couldn't lose face like that. She went up to see Mister Singer. The words came all in a rush:  'Listen--I believe I got this job.",0
7087,What do you think? Do you think it's a good idea? Do you think it's O.K. to drop out of school and work now? You think it's good?',0
7088,At first he did not understand. His gray eyes half-closed and he stood with his hands deep down in his pockets. There was the old feeling that they waited to tell each other things that had never been told before. The thing she had to say now was not much. But what he had to tell her would be right--and if he said the job sounded O.K. then she would feel better about it. She repeated the words slowly and waited.,0
7089,"'You think it's good?'  Mister Singer considered. Then he nodded yes. She got the job. The manager took her and Hazel back to a little office and talked with them. Afterward she couldn't remember how the manager looked or anything that had been said. But she was hired, and on the way out of the place she bought ten cents' worth of chocolate and a little modeling-clay set for George. On June the fifth she was to start work. She stood for a long while before the window of Mister Singer's jewelry store. Then she hung around on the corner.",0
7090,"[15] The time had come for Singer to go to Antonapoulos again. The journey was a long one. For, although the distance between them was something less than two hundred miles, the train meandered to points far out of the way and stopped for long hours at certain stations during the night. Singer would leave the town in the afternoon and travel all through the night and until the early morning of the next day. As usual, he was ready far in advance. He planned to have a full week with his friend this visit. His clothes had been sent to the cleaner's, his hat blocked, and his bags were in readiness. The gifts he would carry were wrapped in colored tissue paper--and in addition there was a de luxe basket of fruits done up in cellophane and a crate of late-shipped strawberries. On the morning before his departure Singer cleaned his room. In his ice box he found a bit of left-over goose liver and took it out to the alley for the neighborhood cat. On his door he tacked the same sign he had posted there before, stating that he would be absent for several days on business. During all these preparations he moved about leisurely with two vivid spots of color on his cheekbones. His face was very solemn.",0
7091,"Then at last the hour for departure was at hand. He stood on the platform, burdened with his suitcases and gifts, and watched the train roll in on the station tracks. He found himself a seat in the day coach and hoisted his luggage on the rack above his head. The car was crowded, for the most part with mothers and children. The green plush seats had a grimy smell. The windows of the car were dirty and rice thrown at some recent bridal pair lay scattered on the floor. Singer smiled cordially to his fellow-travelers and leaned back in his seat. He closed his eyes. The lashes made a dark, curved fringe above the hollows of his cheeks. His right hand moved nervously inside his pocket.",0
7092,"For a while his thoughts lingered in the town he was leaving behind him. He saw Mick and Doctor Copeland and Jake Blount and Biff Brannon. The faces crowded in on him out of the darkness so that he felt smothered. He thought of the quarrel between Blount and the Negro. The nature of this quarrel was hopelessly confused in his mind--but each of them had on several occasions broken out into a bitter tirade against the other, the absent one. He had agreed with each of them in turn, though what it was they wanted him to sanction he did not know. And Mick--her face was urgent and she said a good deal that he did not understand in the least. And then Biff Brannon at the New York Café. Brannon with his dark, iron-like jaw and his watchful eyes. And strangers who followed him about the streets and buttonholed him for unexplainable reasons. The Turk at the linen shop who flung his hands up in his face and babbled with his tongue to make words the shape of which Singer had never imagined before. A certain mill foreman and an old black woman. A businessman on the main street and an urchin who solicited soldiers for a whorehouse near the river. Singer wriggled his shoulders uneasily. The train rocked with a smooth, easy motion. His head nodded to rest on his shoulder and for a short while he slept.",0
7093,"When he opened his eyes again the town was far behind him. The town was forgotten. Outside the dirty window there was the brilliant midsummer countryside. The sun slanted in strong, bronze-colored rays over the green fields of the new cotton. There were acres of tobacco, the plants heavy and green like some monstrous jungle weed. The orchards of peaches with the lush fruit weighting down the dwarfed trees. There were miles of pastures and tens of miles of wasted, washed-out land abandoned to the hardier weeds. The train cut through deep green pine forests where the ground was covered with the slick brown needles and the tops of the trees stretched up virgin and tall into the sky. And farther, a long way south of the town, the cypress swamps--with the gnarled roots of the trees writhing down into the brackish waters, where the gray, tattered moss trailed from the branches, where tropical water flowers blossomed in dankness and gloom. Then out again into the open beneath the sun and the indigo-blue sky.",0
7094,"Singer sat solemn and timid, his face turned fully toward the window. The great sweeps of space and the hard, elemental coloring almost blinded him. This kaleidoscopic variety of scene, this abundance of growth and color, seemed somehow connected with his friend. His thoughts were with Antonapoulos. The bliss of their reunion almost stifled him. His nose was pinched and he breathed with quick, short breaths through his slightly open mouth.",0
7095,"Antonapoulos would be glad to see him. He would enjoy the fresh fruits and the presents. By now he would be out of the sick ward and able to go on an excursion to the movies, and afterward to the hotel where they had eaten dinner on the first visit. Singer had written many letters to Antonapoulos, but he had not posted them. He surrendered himself wholly to thoughts of his friend.",0
7096,"The half-year since he had last been with him seemed neither a long nor a short span of time. Behind each waking moment there had always been his friend. And this submerged communion with Antonapoulos had grown and changed as though they were together in the flesh. Sometimes he thought of Antonapoulos with awe and self-abasement, sometimes with pride--always with love unchecked by criticism, freed of will. When he dreamed at night the face of his friend was always before him, massive and wise and gentle. And in his waking thoughts they were eternally united.",0
7097,"The summer evening came slowly. The sun sank down behind a ragged line of trees in the distance and the sky paled. The twilight was languid and soft. There was a white full moon, and low purple clouds lay over the horizon. The earth, the trees, the unpainted rural dwellings darkened slowly. At intervals mild summer lightning quivered in the air. Singer watched all of this intently until at last the night had come, and his own face was reflected in the glass before him.",0
7098,"Children staggered up and down the aisle of the car with dripping paper cups of water. An old man in overalls who had the seat before Singer drank whiskey from time to time from a Coca-Cola bottle. Between swallows he plugged the bottle carefully with a wad of paper. A little girl on the right combed her hair with a sticky red lollipop. Shoeboxes were opened and trays of supper were brought in from the dining-car. Singer did not eat. He leaned back in his seat and kept desultory account of all that went on around him. At last the car settled down. Children lay on the broad plush seats and slept, while men and women doubled up with their pillows and rested as best they could.",0
7099,"Singer did not sleep. He pressed his face close against the glass and strained to see into the night. The darkness was heavy and velvety. Sometimes there was a patch of moonlight or the flicker of a lantern from the window of some house along the way. From the moon he saw that the train had turned from its southward course and was headed toward the east. The eagerness he felt was so keen that his nose was too pinched to breathe through and his cheeks were scarlet. He sat there, his face pressed close against the cold, sooty glass of the window, through most of the long night journey.",0
7100,"The train was more than an hour late, and the fresh, bright summer morning was well under way when they arrived. Singer went immediately to the hotel, a very good hotel where he had made reservations in advance. He unpacked his bags and arranged the presents he would take Antonapoulos on the bed. From the menu the bellboy brought him he selected a luxurious breakfast--broiled bluefish, hominy, French toast, and hot black coffee. After breakfast he rested before the electric fan in his underwear. At noon he began to dress. He bathed and shaved and laid out fresh linen and his best seersucker suit. At three o'clock the hospital was open for visiting hours. It was Tuesday and the eighteenth of July.",0
7101,"At the asylum he sought Antonapoulos first in the sick ward where he had been confined before. But at the doorway of the room he saw immediately that his friend was not there. Next he found his way through the corridors to the office where he had been taken the time before. He had his question already written on one of the cards he carried about with him. The person behind the desk was not the same as the one who had been there before. He was a young man, almost a boy, with a half-formed, immature face and a lank mop of hair. Singer handed him the card and stood quietly, his arms heaped with packages, his weight resting on his heels.",0
7102,"The young man shook his head. He leaned over the desk and scribbled loosely on a pad of paper. Singer read what he had written and the spots of color drained from his cheekbones instantly. He looked at the note a long time, his eyes cut sideways and his head bowed. For it was written there that Antonapoulos was dead.",0
7103,"On the way back to the hotel he was careful not to crush the fruit he had brought with him. He took the packages up to his room and then wandered down to the lobby. Behind a potted palm tree there was a slot machine. He inserted a nickel but when he tried to pull the lever he found that the machine was jammed. Over this incident he made a great to-do. He cornered the clerk and furiously demonstrated what had happened. His face was deathly pale and he was so beside himself that tears rolled down the ridges of his nose. He flailed his hands and even stamped once with his long, narrow, elegantly shoed foot on the plush carpet. Nor was he satisfied when his coin was refunded, but insisted on checking out immediately. He packed his bag and was obliged to work energetically to make it close again. For in addition to the articles he had brought with him he carried away three towels, two cakes of soap, a pen and a bottle of ink, a roll of toilet paper, and a Holy Bible. He paid his bill and walked to the railway station to put his belongings in custody. The train did not leave until nine in the evening and he had the empty afternoon before him.",0
7104,This town was smaller than the one in which he lived. The business streets intersected to form the shape of a cross. The stores had a countrified look; there were harnesses and sacks of feed in half of the display windows. Singer walked listlessly along the sidewalks. His throat felt swollen and he wanted to swallow but was unable to do so. To relieve this strangled feeling he bought a drink in one of the drugstores. He idled in the barber shop and purchased a few trifles at the ten-cent store. He looked no one full in the face and his head drooped down to one side like a sick animal's.,0
7105,"The afternoon was almost ended when a strange thing happened to Singer. He had been walking slowly and irregularly along the curb of the street. The sky was overcast and the air humid. Singer did not raise his head, but as he passed the town pool room he caught a sidewise glance of something that disturbed him. He passed the pool room and then stopped in the middle of the street. Listlessly he retraced his steps and stood before the open door of the place. There were three mutes inside and they were talking with their hands together. All three of them were coatless. They wore bowler hats and bright ties. Each of them held a glass of beer in his left hand. There was a certain brotherly resemblance between them.",0
7106,Singer went inside. For a moment he had trouble taking his hand from his pocket. Then clumsily he formed a word of greeting. He was clapped on the shoulder. A cold drink was ordered. They surrounded him and the fingers of their hands shot out like pistons as they questioned him.,0
7107,He told his own name and the name of the town where he lived. After that he could think of nothing else to tell about himself. He asked if they knew Spiros Antonapoulos. They did not know him. Singer stood with his hands dangling loose. His head was still inclined to one side and his glance was oblique. He was so listless and cold that the three mutes in the bowler hats looked at him queerly. After a while they left him out of their conversation. And when they had paid for the rounds of beers and were ready to depart they did not suggest that he join them.,0
7108,"Although Singer had been adrift on the streets for half a day he almost missed his train. It was not clear to him how this happened or how he had spent the hours before. He reached the station two minutes before the train pulled out, and barely had time to drag his luggage aboard and find a seat. The car he chose was almost empty. When he was settled he opened the crate of strawberries and picked them over with finicky care. The berries were of a giant size, large as walnuts and in full-blown ripeness. The green leaves at the top of the rich-colored fruit were like tiny bouquets. Singer put a berry in his mouth and though the juice had a lush, wild sweetness there was already a subtle flavor of decay. He ate until his palate was dulled by the taste and then rewrapped the crate and placed it on the rack above him. At midnight he drew the window-shade and lay down on the seat. He was curled in a ball, his coat pulled over his face and head. In this position he lay in a stupor of half-sleep for about twelve hours. The conductor had to shake him when they arrived.",0
7109,"Singer left his luggage in the middle of the station floor. Then he walked to the shop. He greeted the jeweler for whom he worked with a listless turn of his hand. When he went out again there was something heavy in his pocket. For a while he rambled with bent head along the streets. But the unrefracted brilliance of the sun, the humid heat, oppressed him. He returned to his room with swollen eyes and an aching head. After resting he drank a glass of iced coffee and smoked a cigarette. Then when he had washed the ash tray and the glass he brought out a pistol from his pocket and put a bullet in his chest.",0
7110,"PART THREE   [1] August 21, 1939 Morning   'I will not be hurried,' Doctor Copeland said. 'Just let me be. Kindly allow me to sit here in peace a moment. '  'Father, us not trying to rush you.",0
7111,"But it time now to get gone from here. ' Doctor Copeland rocked stubbornly, his gray shawl drawn close around his shoulders. Although the morning was warm and fresh, a small wood fire burned in the stove. The kitchen was bare of all furniture except the chair in which he sat. The other rooms were empty, too. Most of the furniture had been moved to Portia's house, and the rest was tied to the automobile outside. All was in readiness except his own mind. But how could he leave when there was neither beginning nor end, neither truth nor purpose in his thoughts? He put up his hand to steady his trembling head and continued to rock himself slowly in the creaking chair.",0
7112,"Behind the closed door he heard their voices:  'I done all I can. He determined to sit there till he good and ready to leave.' 'Buddy and me done wrapped the china plates and----'  'Us should have left before the dew dried,' said the old man.",0
7113,"' As is, night liable to catch us on the road. '",0
7114,"Their voices quieted. Footsteps echoed in the empty hallway and he could hear them no more. On the floor beside him was a cup and saucer. He filled it with coffee from the pot on the top of the stove. As he rocked he drank the coffee and warmed his fingers in the steam. This could not truly be the end. Other voices called wordless in his heart. The voice of Jesus and of John Brown. The voice of the great Spinoza and of Karl Marx. The calling voices of all those who had fought and to whom it had been vouchsafed to complete their missions. The grief-bound voices of his people. And also the voice of the dead. Of the mute Singer, who was a righteous white man of understanding. The voices of the weak and of the mighty. The rolling voice of his people growing always in strength and in power. The voice of the strong, true purpose. And in answer the words trembled on his lips--the words which are surely the root of all human grief--so that he almost said aloud: 'Almighty Host! Utmost power of the universe! I have done those things which I ought not to have done and left undone those things which I ought to have done. So this cannot truly be the end. '",0
7115,"He had first come into the house with her whom he loved. And Daisy was dressed in her bridal gown and wore a white lace veil. Her skin was the beautiful color of dark honey and her laughter was sweet. At night he had shut himself in the bright room to study alone. He had tried to cogitate and to discipline himself to study. But with Daisy near him there was a strong desire in him that would not go away with study. So sometimes he surrendered to these feelings, and again he bit his lips and meditated with the books throughout the night. And then there were Hamilton and Karl Marx and William and Portia. All lost. No one remained.",0
7116,And Madyben and Benny Mae. And Benedine Madine and Mady Copeland. Those who carried his name. And those whom he had exhorted. But out of the thousands of them where was there one to whom he could entrust the mission and then take ease?  All of his life he had known it strongly.,0
7117,"He had known the reason for his working and was sure in his heart because he knew each day what lay ahead of him. He would go with his bag from house to house, and on all things he would talk to them and patiently explain. And then in the night he would be happy in the knowledge that the day had been a day of purpose. And even without Daisy and Hamilton and Karl Marx and William and Portia he could sit by the stove alone and take joy from this knowledge. He would drink a pot of turnip-green liquor and eat a pone of cornbread. A deep feeling of satisfaction would be in him because the day was good.",0
7118,There were thousands of such times of satisfaction. But what had been their meaning? Out of all the years he could think of no work of lasting value.,0
7119,"After a while the door to the hall was opened and Portia came in. 'I reckon I going to have to dress you like a baby,' she said. 'Here your shoes and socks. Let me take off your bedroom shoes and put them on. We got to get gone from here pretty soon. '",0
7120,'Why have you done this to me?' he asked bitterly. 'What I done to you now?'  'You know full well that I do not want to leave.,0
7121,"You pressed me into saying yes when I was in no fit condition to make a decision. I wish to remain where I have always been, and you know it. '  'Listen to you carry on!'",0
7122,Portia said angrily. 'You done grumbled so much that I nearly worn out. You done fumed and fussed so that I right shamed for you.',0
7123,'Pshaw! Say what you will. You only come before me like a gnat. I know what I wish and will not be pestered into doing that which is wrong. ',0
7124,"Portia took off his bedroom shoes and unrolled a pair of clean black cotton socks. 'Father, less us quit this here argument. Us have all done the best we know how. It entirely the best plan for you to go on out with Grandpapa and Hamilton and Buddy. They going to take good care of you and you going to get well. '",0
7125,"'No, I will not,' said Doctor Copeland. ' But I would have recovered here. I know it. '",0
7126,'Who you think could pay the note on this here house? How you think us could feed you? Who you think could take care you here?',0
7127,"'I have always managed, and I can manage yet.' 'You just trying to be contrary. '",0
7128,'Pshaw! You come before me like a gnat. And I ignore you. ',0
7129,"'That certainly is a nice way to talk to me while I trying to put on your shoes and socks.' 'I am sorry. Forgive me, Daughter.'",0
7130,"'Course you sorry,' she said. 'Course we both sorry. Us can't afford to quarrel. And besides, once we get you settled on the farm you going to like it. They got the prettiest vegetable garden I ever seen. Make my mouth slobber to think about it. And chickens and two breed sows and eighteen peach trees. You just going to be crazy about it there. I sure do wish it was me could get a chance to go.'",0
7131,"'I wish so, too.' 'How come you so determined to grieve?'  'I just feel that I have failed,' he said. 'How you mean you done failed?'",0
7132,"'I do not know. Just leave me be, Daughter. Just let me sit here in peace a moment. '",0
7133,'O.K. But us got to get gone from here pretty soon. ',0
7134,He would be silent. He would sit quietly and rock in the chair until the sense of order was in him once more. His head trembled and his backbone ached.,0
7135,"'I certainly hope this,' Portia said. 'I certainly hope that when I dead and gone as many peoples grieves for me as grieves for Mr. Singer. I sure would like to know I were going to have as sad a funeral as he had and as many peoples----'  'Hush!' said Doctor Copeland roughly.",0
7136,'You talk too much. ' But truly with the death of that white man a dark sorrow had lain down in his heart. He had talked to him as to no other white man and had trusted him. And the mystery of his suicide had left him baffled and without support. There was neither beginning nor end to this sorrow. Nor understanding. Always he would return in his thoughts to this white man who was not insolent or scornful but who was just. And how can the dead be truly dead when they still live in the souls of those who are left behind? But of all this he must not think. He must thrust it from him now.,0
7137,"For it was discipline he needed. During the past month the black, terrible feelings had arisen again to wrestle with his spirit. There was the hatred that for days had truly let him down into the regions of death. After the quarrel with Mr. Blount, the midnight visitor, there had been in him a murderous darkness. Yet now he could not clearly recall those issues which were the cause of their dispute. And then the different anger that came in him when he looked on the stumps of Willie's legs. The warring love and hatred--love for his people and hatred for the oppressors of his people--that left him exhausted and sick in spirit.",0
7138,"'Daughter,' he said. 'Get me my watch and coat. I am going.'",0
7139,He pushed himself up with the arms of the chair. The floor seemed a far way from his face and after the long time in bed his legs were very weak. For a moment he felt he would fall. He walked dizzily across the bare room and stood leaning against the side of the doorway. He coughed and took from his pocket one of the squares of paper to hold over his mouth.,0
7140,"'Here your coat,' Portia said. ' But it is so hot outside you not going to need it.'",0
7141,He walked for the last time through the empty house. The blinds were closed and in the darkened rooms there was the smell of dust. He rested against the wall of the vestibule and then went outside. The morning was bright and warm. Many friends had come to say good-bye the night before and in the very early morning--but now only the family was congregated on the porch. The wagon and the automobile were parked out in the street.,0
7142,"'Well Benedict Mady,' the old man said. 'I reckon you ghy be a little bit homesick these first few days. But won't be long. '",0
7143,'I do not have any home. So why should I be homesick?' Portia wet her lips nervously and said: 'He coming back whenever he get good and ready. Buddy will be glad to ride him to town in the car. Buddy just love to drive. ',0
7144,"The automobile was loaded. Boxes of books were tied to the running-board. The back seat was crowded with two chairs and the filing case. His office desk, legs in the air, had been fastened to the top. But although the car was weighted down the wagon was almost empty. The mule stood patiently, a brick tied to his reins.",0
7145,"'Karl Marx,' Doctor Copeland said. 'Look sharp. Go over the house and make sure that nothing is left. Bring the cup I left on the floor and my rocking-chair.'",0
7146,"'Less us get started. I anxious to be home by dinner-time,' Hamilton said. At last they were ready. Highboy cranked the automobile. Karl Marx sat at the wheel and Portia, Highboy, and William were crowded together on the back seat.",0
7147,"'Father, suppose you set on Highboy's lap. I believe you be more comfortable than scrouged up here with us and all this furniture. '",0
7148,"'No, it is too crowded. I would rather ride in the wagon.' 'But you not used to the wagon,' Karl Marx said. 'It going to be very bumpy and the trip liable to take all day. '",0
7149,'That does not matter. I have ridden in many a wagon before this.'  'Tell Hamilton to come with us. I sure he rather ride in the automobile.',0
7150,"Grandpapa had driven the wagon into town the day before. They brought with them a load of produce, peaches and cabbages and turnips, for Hamilton to sell in town. All except a sack of peaches had been marketed.",0
7151,"'Well, Benedict Mady, I see you riding home with me,' the old man said. Doctor Copeland climbed into the back of the wagon. He was weary as though his bones were made of lead. His head trembled and a sudden spasm of nausea made him lie down flat on the rough boards.",0
7152,"'I right glad you coming,' Grandpapa said. 'You understand I always had deep respect for scholars. Deep respect. I able to overlook and forget a good many things if a man be a scholar. I very glad to have a scholar like you in the fambly again.'",0
7153,"The wheels of the wagon creaked. They were on the way. 'I will return soon,' Doctor Copeland said. 'After only a month or two I will return.'",0
7154,'Hamilton he a right good scholar. I think he favors you some. He do all my figuring on paper for me and he read the newspapers. And Whitman I think he ghy be a scholar. Right now he able to read the Bible to me. And do number work. Small a child as he is. I always had a deep respect for scholars.',0
7155,"The motion of the wagon jolted his back. He looked up at the branches overhead, and then when there was no shade he covered his face with a handkerchief to shield his eyes from the sun. It was not possible that this could be the end. Always he had felt in him the strong, true purpose. For forty years his mission was his life and his life was his mission. And yet all remained to be done and nothing was completed.",0
7156,"'Yes, Benedict Mady, I right glad to have you with us again. I been waiting to ask you about this peculiar feeling in my right foot. A queer feeling like my foot gone to sleep. I taken 666 and rubbed it with liniment. I hoping you will find me a good treatment.'",0
7157,"'I will do what I can.' 'Yes, I glad to have you. I believe in all kinfolks sticking together--blood kin and marriage kin. I believe in all us struggling along and helping each other out, and some day us will have a reward in the Beyond.'  'Pshaw!'",0
7158,Doctor Copeland said bitterly. 'I believe in justice now. ',0
7159,'What that you say you believe in? You speak so hoarse I ain't able to hear you. ',0
7160,'In justice for us. Justice for us Negroes.'  'That right.' He felt the fire in him and he could not be still. He wanted to sit up and speak in a loud voice--yet when he tried to raise himself he could not find the strength. The words in his heart grew big and they would not be silent. But the old man had ceased to listen and there was no one to hear him.,0
7161,"'Git, Lee Jackson. Git, Honey. Pick up your feets and quit this here poking. Us got a long way to go.'",0
7162,"[2] Afternoon   Jake ran at a violent, clumsy pace. He went through Weavers Lane and then cut into a side alley, climbed a fence, and hastened onward. Nausea rose in his belly so that there was the taste of vomit in his throat. A barking dog chased beside him until he stopped long enough to threaten it with a rock. His eyes were wide with horror and he held his hand clapped to his open mouth.",0
7163,"Christ! So this was the finish. A brawl. A riot. A fight with every man for himself. Bloody heads and eyes cut with broken bottles. Christ! And the wheezy music of the flying-jinny above the noise. The dropped hamburgers and cotton candy and the screaming younguns. And him in it all. Fighting blind with the dust and sun. The sharp cut of teeth against his knuckles. And laughing. Christ! And the feeling that he had let loose a wild, hard rhythm in him that wouldn't stop. And then looking close into the dead black face and not knowing. Not even knowing if he had killed or not. But wait. Christ! Nobody could have stopped it.",0
7164,"Jake slowed and jerked his head nervously to look behind him. The alley was empty. He vomited and wiped his mouth and forehead with the sleeve of his shirt. Afterward he rested for a minute and felt better. He had run for about eight blocks and with short cuts there was about half a mile to go. The dizziness cleared in his head so that from all the wild feelings he could remember facts. He started off again, this time at a steady jog.",0
7165,"Nobody could have stopped it. All through the summer he had stamped them out like sudden fires. All but this one. And this fight nobody could have stopped. It seemed to blaze up out of nothing. He had been working on the machinery of the swings and had stopped to get a glass of water. As he passed across the grounds he saw a white boy and a Negro walking around each other. They were both drunk. Half the crowd was drunk that afternoon, for it was Saturday and the mills had run full time that week. The heat and the sun were sickening and there was a heavy stink in the air.",0
7166,"He saw the two fighters close in on each other. But he knew that this was not the beginning. He had felt a big fight coming for a long time. And the funny thing was he found time to think of all this. He stood watching for about five seconds before he pushed into the crowd. In that short time he thought of many things. He thought of Singer. He thought of the sullen summer afternoons and the black, hot nights, of all the fights he had broken up and the quarrels he had hushed.",0
7167,"Then he saw the flash of a pocketknife in the sun. He shouldered through a knot of people and jumped on the back of the Negro who held the knife. The man went down with him and they were on the ground together. The smell of the Negro was mixed with the heavy dust in his lungs. Someone trampled on his legs and his head was kicked. By the time he got to his feet again the fight had become general. The Negroes were fighting the white men and the white men were fighting the Negroes. He saw clearly, second by second. The white boy who had picked the fight seemed a kind of leader. He was the head of a gang that came often to the show. They were about sixteen years old and they wore white duck trousers and fancy rayon polo shirts. The Negroes fought back as best they could. Some had razors.",0
7168,"He began to yell out words: Order! Help! Police! But it was like yelling at a breaking dam. There was a terrible sound in his ear--terrible because it was human and yet without words. The sound rose to a roar that deafened him. He was hit on the head. He could not see what went on around him. He saw only eyes and mouths and fists--wild eyes and half-closed eyes, wet, loose mouths and clenched ones, black fists and white. He grabbed a knife from a hand and caught an upraised fist. Then the dust and the sun blinded him and the one thought in his mind was to get out and find a telephone to call for help.",0
7169,But he was caught. And without knowing when it happened he piled into the fight himself. He hit out with his fists and felt the soft squish of wet mouths. He fought with his eyes shut and his head lowered. A crazy sound came out of his throat. He hit with all his strength and charged with his head like a bull. Senseless words were in his mind and he was laughing. He did not see who he hit and did not know who hit him. But he knew that the line-up of the fight had changed and now each man was for himself.,0
7170,Then suddenly it was finished. He tripped and fell over backward. He was knocked out so that it may have been a minute or it may have been much longer before he opened his eyes. A few drunks were still fighting but two dicks were breaking it up fast. He saw what he had tripped over. He lay half on and half beside the body of a young Negro boy. With only one look he knew that he was dead. There was a cut on the side of his neck but it was hard to see how he had died in such a hurry. He knew the face but could not place it. The boy's mouth was open and his eyes were open in surprise. The ground was littered with papers and broken bottles and trampled hamburgers. The head was broken off one of the jinny horses and a booth was destroyed. He was sitting up. He saw the dicks and in a panic he started to run. By now they must have lost his track.,0
7171,"There were only four more blocks ahead, and then he would be safe for sure. Fear had shortened his breath so that he was winded. He clenched his fists and lowered his head. Then suddenly he slowed and halted. He was alone in an alley near the main street. On one side was the wall of a building and he slumped against it, panting, the corded vein in his forehead inflamed. In his confusion he had run all the way across the town to reach the room of his friend. And Singer was dead. He began to cry. He sobbed aloud, and water dripped down from his nose and wet his mustache.",0
7172,"A wall, a flight of stairs, a road ahead. The burning sun was like a heavy weight on him. He started back the way he had come. This time he walked slowly, wiping his wet face with the greasy sleeve of his shirt. He could not stop the trembling of his lips and he bit them until he tasted blood.",0
7173,"At the corner of the next block he ran into Simms. The old codger was sitting on a box with his Bible on his knees. There was a tall board fence behind him, and on it a message was written with purple chalk.",0
7174,"He Died to Save You   Hear the Story of His Love and Grace Every Nite 7.15 P.M. The street was empty. Jake tried to cross over to the other sidewalk, but Simms caught him by the arm.",0
7175,"'Come, all ye disconsolate and sore of heart. Lay down your sins and troubles before the blessed feet of Him who died to save you. Wherefore goest thou, Brother Blount?'  'Home to hockey,' Jake said.",0
7176,'I got to hockey. Does the Saviour have anything against that?'  'Sinner! The Lord remembers all your transgressions. The Lord has a message for you this very night. '  'Does the Lord remember that dollar I gave you last week?'  'Jesus has a message for you at seven-fifteen tonight.,0
7177,You be here on time to hear His Word.' Jake licked his mustache. 'You have such a crowd every night I can't get up close enough to hear.',0
7178,"'There is a place for scoffers. Besides, I have had a sign that soon the Saviour wants me to build a house for Him. On that lot at the corner of Eighteenth Avenue and Sixth Street. A tabernacle large enough to hold five hundred people. Then you scoffers will see. The Lord prepareth a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; he anointeth my head with oil. My cup runneth----'  'I can round you up a crowd tonight,' Jake said.",0
7179,"'How?'  'Give me your pretty colored chalk. I promise a big crowd.' 'I've seen your signs,' Simms said. ' Workers! America Is the Richest Country in the World Yet a Third of Us Are Starving. When Will We Unite and Demand Our Share?""--all that. Your signs are radical. I wouldn't let you use my chalk.'",0
7180,'But I don't plan to write signs. ' Simms fingered the pages of his Bible and waited suspiciously.,0
7181,"'I'll get you a fine crowd. On the pavements at each end of the block I'll draw you some good-looking naked floozies. All in color with arrows to point the way. Sweet, plump, bare-tailed----'  'Babylonian!'",0
7182,the old man screamed. 'Child of Sodom! God will remember this.',0
7183,"Jake crossed over to the other sidewalk and started toward the house where he lived. ' So long, Brother.'  'Sinner,' the old man called.",0
7184,'You come back here at seven-fifteen sharp. And hear the message from Jesus that will give you faith. Be saved. ',0
7185,"Singer was dead. And the way he had felt when he first heard that he had killed himself was not sad--it was angry. He was before a wall. He remembered all the innermost thoughts that he had told to Singer, and with his death it seemed to him that they were lost. And why had Singer wanted to end his life? Maybe he had gone insane. But anyway he was dead, dead, dead. He could not be seen or touched or spoken to, and the room where they had spent so many hours had been rented to a girl who worked as a typist. He could go there no longer. He was alone. A wall, a flight of stairs, an open road.",0
7186,"Jake locked the door of his room behind him. He was hungry and there was nothing to eat. He was thirsty and only a few drops of warm water were left in the pitcher by the table. The bed was unmade and dusty fluff had accumulated on the floor. Papers were scattered all about the room, because recently he had written many short notices and distributed them through the town. Moodily he glanced at one of the papers labeled 'The T.W.O.C. Is Your Best Friend.' Some of the notices consisted of only one sentence, others were longer. There was one full-page manifesto entitled 'The Affinity Between Our Democracy and Fascism.'",0
7187,"For a month he had worked on these papers, scribbling them during working hours, typing and making carbons on the typewriter at the New York Café, distributing them by hand. He had worked day and night. But who read them? What good had any of it done? A town this size was too big for any one man. And now he was leaving.",0
7188,"But where would it be this time? The names of cities called to him--Memphis, Wilmington, Gastonia, New Orleans. He would go somewhere. But not out of the South. The old restlessness and hunger were in him again. It was different this time. He did not long for open space and freedom--just the reverse. He remembered what the Negro, Copeland, had said to him, 'Do not attempt to stand alone.' There were times when that was best.",0
7189,"Jake moved the bed across the room. On the part of the floor the bed had hidden there were a suitcase and a pile of books and dirty clothes. Impatiently he began to pack. The old Negro's face was in his mind and some of the words they had said came back to him. Copeland was crazy. He was a fanatic, so that it was maddening to try to reason with him. Still the terrible anger that they had felt that night had later been hard to understand. Copeland knew. And those who knew were like a handful of naked soldiers before an armed battalion. And what had they done? They had turned to quarrel with each other. Copeland was wrong--yes--he was crazy. But on some points they might be able to work together after all. If they didn't talk too much. He would go and see him. A sudden urge to hurry came in him. Maybe that would be the best thing after all. Maybe that was the sign, the hand he had so long awaited.",0
7190,"Without pausing to wash the grime from his face and hands he strapped his suitcase and left the room. Outside the air was sultry and there was a foul odor in the street. Clouds had formed in the sky. The atmosphere was so still that the smoke from a mill in the district went up in a straight, unbroken line. As Jake walked the suitcase bumped awkwardly against his knees, and often he jerked his head to look behind him. Copeland lived all the way across the town, so there was need to hurry. The clouds in the sky grew steadily denser, and foretold a heavy summer rain before nightfall.",0
7191,"When he reached the house where Copeland lived he saw that the shutters were drawn. He walked to the back and peered through the window at the abandoned kitchen. A hollow, desperate disappointment made his hands feel sweaty and his heart lose the rhythm of its beat. He went to the house on the left but no one was at home. There was nothing to do except to go to the Kelly house and question Portia.",0
7192,He hated to be near that house again. He couldn't stand to see the hatrack in the front hall and the long flight of stairs he had climbed so many times. He walked slowly back across the town and approached by way of the alley. He went in the rear door. Portia was in the kitchen and the little boy was with her.,0
7193,"'No, sir, Mr. Blount,' Portia said. 'I know you were a mighty good friend of Mr. Singer and you understand what Father thought of him. But we taken Father out in the country this morning and I know in my soul I got no business telling you exactly where he is. If you don't mind I rather speak out and not minch the matter.'",0
7194,"'You don't have to minch anything,' Jake said. ' But why?'  'After the time you come to see us Father were so sick us expected him to die.",0
7195,"It taken us a long time to get him able to sit up. He doing right well now. He going to get a lot stronger where he is now. But whether you understand this or not he right bitter against white peoples just now and he very easy to upset. And besides, if you don't mind speaking out, what you want with Father, anyway?'  'Nothing,' Jake said.",0
7196,"' Nothing you would understand.' 'Us colored peoples have feelings just like anybody else. And I stand by what I said, Mr. Blount. Father just a sick old colored man and he had enough trouble already. Us got to look after him. And he not anxious to see you--I know that. '",0
7197,"Out in the street again he saw that the clouds had turned a deep, angry purple. In the stagnant air there was a storm smell. The vivid green of the trees along the sidewalk seemed to steal into the atmosphere so that there was a strange greenish glow over the street. All was so hushed and still that Jake paused for a moment to sniff the air and look around him. Then he grasped his suitcase under his arm and began to run toward the awnings of the main street. But he was not quick enough. There was one metallic crash of thunder and the air chilled suddenly. Large silver drops of rain hissed on the pavement. An avalanche of water blinded him. When he reached the New York Café his clothes clung wet and shriveled to his body and his shoes squeaked with water.",0
7198,"Brannon pushed aside his newspaper and leaned his elbows on the counter. ' Now, this is really curious. I had this intuition you would come here just after the rain broke. I knew in my bones you were coming and that you would make it just too late.' He mashed his nose with his thumb until it was white and flat. ' And a suitcase?'",0
7199,"'It looks like a suitcase,' Jake said. ' And it feels like a suitcase. So if you believe in the actuality of suitcases I reckon this is one, all right. '",0
7200,'You ought not to stand around like this. Go on upstairs and throw me down your clothes. Louis will run over them with a hot iron.',0
7201,"Jake sat at one of the back booth tables and rested his head in his hands. ' No, thanks. I just want to rest here and get my wind again. '",0
7202,"'But your lips are turning blue. You look all knocked up.' 'I'm all right. What I want is some supper. '  'Supper won't be ready for half an hour,' Brannon said patiently.",0
7203,'Any old leftovers will do. Just put them on a plate. You don't even have to bother to heat them. ',0
7204,"The emptiness in him hurt. He wanted to look neither backward nor forward. He walked two of his short, chunky fingers across the top of the table. It was more than a year now since he had sat at this table for the first time. And how much further was he now than then? No further. Nothing had happened except that he had made a friend and lost him. He had given Singer everything and then the man had killed himself. So he was left out on a limb. And now it was up to him to get out of it by himself and make a new start again. At the thought of it panic came in him. He was tired. He leaned his head against the wall and put his feet on the seat beside him.",0
7205,'Here you are.' Brannon said. 'This ought to help out.',0
7206,"He put down a glass of some hot drink and a plate of chicken pie. The drink had a sweet, heavy smell. Jake inhaled the steam and closed his eyes. 'What's in it?'  'Lemon rind rubbed on a lump of sugar and boiling water with rum.",0
7207,"It's a good drink.' 'How much do I owe you?' 'I don't know offhand, but I'll figure it out before you leave. '",0
7208,"Jake took a deep draught of the toddy and washed it around in his mouth before swallowing. 'You'll never get the money,' he said. 'I don't have it to pay you--and if I did I probably wouldn't, anyway. '",0
7209,"'Well, have I been pressing you? Have I ever made you out a bill and asked you to pay up?'  'No,' Jake said. 'You been very reasonable. And since I think about it you're a right decent guy--from the personal perspective, that is. '",0
7210,Brannon sat across from him at the table. Something was on his mind. He slid the salt-shaker back and forth and kept smoothing his hair. He smelled like perfume and his striped blue shirt was very fresh and clean. The sleeves were rolled and held in place by old-fashioned blue sleeve garters.,0
7211,At last he cleared his throat in a hesitating way and said: 'I was glancing through the afternoon paper just before you came. It seems you had a lot of trouble at your place today. ',0
7212,"'That's right. What did it say?'  'Wait. I'll get it.' Brannon fetched the paper from the counter and leaned against the partition of the booth. 'It says on the front page that at the Sunny Dixie Show, located so and so, there was a general disturbance. Two Negroes were fatally injured with wounds inflicted by knives. Three others suffered minor wounds and were taken for treatment to the city hospital. The dead were Jimmy Macy and Lancy Davis. The wounded were John Hamlin, white, of Central Mill City, Various Wilson, Negro, and so forth and so on. Quote: ""A number of arrests were made. It is alleged that the disturbance was caused by labor agitation, as papers of a subversive nature were found on and about the site of disturbance. Other arrests are expected shortly.""' Brannon clicked his teeth together. 'The set-up of this paper gets worse every day. Subversive spelled with a u in the second syllable and arrests with only one r.'  'They're smart, all right,' Jake said sneeringly. '",0
7213,Caused by labor agitation. That's remarkable. ',0
7214,"'Anyway, the whole thing is very unfortunate.' Jake held his hand to his mouth and looked down at his empty plate. 'What do you mean to do now?'  'I'm leaving.",0
7215,"I'm getting out of here this afternoon. ' Brannon polished his nails on the palm of his hand. 'Well, of course it's not necessary--but it might be a good thing. Why so headlong? No sense in starting out this time of day. '",0
7216,"'I just rather.'  'I do think it behooves you to make a new start. At the same time why don't you take my advice on this? Myself--I'm a conservative and of course I think your opinions are radical. But at the same time I like to know all sides of a matter. Anyway, I want to see you straighten out. So why don't you go some place where you can meet a few people more or less like yourself? And then settle down?'",0
7217,Jake pushed his plate irritably away from him. 'I don't know where I'm going. Leave me alone. I'm tired. ',0
7218,Brannon shrugged his shoulders and went back to the counter. He was tired enough. The hot rum and the heavy sound of the rain made him drowsy. It felt good to be sitting safe in a booth and to have just eaten a good meal. If he wanted to he could lean over and take a nap--a short one. Already his head felt swollen and heavy and he was more comfortable with his eyes closed. But it would have to be a short sleep because soon he must get out of here.,0
7219,'How long will this rain keep on?' Brannon's voice had drowsy overtones. 'You can't tell--a tropical cloudburst. Might clear up suddenly--or--might thin a little and set in for the night. ',0
7220,"Jake laid his head down on his arms. The sound of the rain was like the swelling sound of the sea. He heard a clock tick and the far-off rattle of dishes. Gradually his hands relaxed. They lay open, palm upward, on the table.",0
7221,"Then Brannon was shaking him by the shoulders and looking into his face. A terrible dream was in his mind. 'Wake up,' Brannon was saying. 'You've had a nightmare. I looked over here and your mouth was open and you were groaning and shuffling your feet on the floor. I never saw anything to equal it. '",0
7222,The dream was still heavy in his mind. He felt the old terror that always came as he awakened. He pushed Brannon away and stood up. 'You don't have to tell me I had a nightmare. I remember just how it was. And I've had the same dream for about fifteen times before. ',0
7223,"He did remember now. Every other time he had been unable to get the dream straight in his waking mind. He had been walking among a great crowd of people--like at the show. But there was also something Eastern about the people around him. There was a terrible bright sun and the people were half-naked. They were silent and slow and their faces had a look in them of starvation. There was no sound, only the sun, and the silent crowd of people. He walked among them and he carried a huge covered basket. He was taking the basket somewhere but he could not find the place to leave it. And in the dream there was a peculiar horror in wandering on and on through the crowd and not knowing where to lay down the burden he had carried in his arms so long.",0
7224,'What was it?' Brannon asked. 'Was the devil chasing you?',0
7225,Jake stood up and went to the mirror behind the counter. His face was dirty and sweaty. There were dark circles beneath his eyes. He wet his handkerchief under the fountain faucet and wiped off his face. Then he took out a pocket comb and neatly combed his mustache.,0
7226,'The dream was nothing. You got to be asleep to understand why it was such a nightmare. ',0
7227,The clock pointed to five-thirty. The rain had almost stopped. Jake picked up his suitcase and went to the front door. 'So long. I'll send you a postcard maybe.',0
7228,"'Wait,' Brannon said. 'You can't go now. It's still raining a little.'",0
7229,'Just dripping off the awning. I rather get out of town before dark. ',0
7230,'But hold on. Do you have any money? Enough to keep going for a week?'  'I don't need money.,0
7231,I been broke before. ' Brannon had an envelope ready and in it were two twenty-dollar bills. Jake looked at them on both sides and put them in his pocket. 'God knows why you do it. You'll never smell them again. But thanks. I won't forget.',0
7232,'Good luck. And let me hear from you.' 'Adios.'  'Good-bye.',0
7233,"The door closed behind him. When he looked back at the end of the block, Brannon was watching from the sidewalk. He walked until he reached the railroad tracks. On either side there were rows of dilapidated two-room houses. In the cramped back yards were rotted privies and lines of torn, smoky rags hung out to dry. For two miles there was not one sight of comfort or space or cleanliness. Even the earth itself seemed filthy and abandoned. Now and then there were signs that a vegetable row had been attempted, but only a few withered collards had survived. And a few fruitless, smutty fig trees. Little younguns swarmed in this filth, the smaller of them stark naked. The sight of this poverty was so cruel and hopeless that Jake snarled and clenched his fists.",0
7234,"He reached the edge of the town and turned off on a highway. Cars passed him by. His shoulders were too wide and his arms too long. He was so strong and ugly that no one wanted to take him in. But maybe a truck would stop before long. The late afternoon sun was out again. Heat made the steam rise from the wet pavement. Jake walked steadily. As soon as the town was behind a new surge of energy came to him. But was this flight or was it onslaught? Anyway, he was going. All was to begin another time. The road ahead lay to the north and slightly to the west. But he would not go too far away. He would not leave the South. That was one clear thing. There was hope in him, and soon perhaps the outline of his journey would take form.",0
7235,"[3] Evening   What good was it? That was the question she would like to know. What the hell good it was. All the plans she had made, and the music. When all that came of it was this trap--the store, then home to sleep, and back at the store again. The clock in front of the place where Mister Singer used to work pointed to seven. And she was just getting off. Whenever there was overtime the manager always told her to stay. Because she could stand longer on her feet and work harder before giving out than any other girl.",0
7236,"The heavy rain had left the sky a pale, quiet blue. Dark was coming. Already the lights were turned on. Automobile horns honked in the street and the newsboys hollered out the headlines in the papers. She didn't want to go home. If she went home now she would lie down on the bed and bawl. That was how tired she was. But if she went into the New York Café and ate some ice cream she might feel O.K. And smoke and be by herself a little while.",0
7237,"The front part of the café was crowded, so she went to the very last booth. It was the small of her back and her face that got so tired. Their motto was supposed to be 'Keep on your toes and smile.' Once she was out of the store she had to frown a long time to get her face natural again. Even her ears were tired. She took off the dangling green earrings that pinched the lobes of her ears. She had bought the earrings the week before--and also a silver bangle bracelet. At first she had worked in Pots and Pans, but now they had changed her to Costume Jewelry.",0
7238,"'Good evening, Mick,' Mister Brannon said. He wiped the bottom of a glass of water with a napkin and set it on the table. 'I want me a chocolate sundae and a nickel glass of draw beer.'  'Together?'",0
7239,"He put down a menu and pointed with his little finger that wore a lady's gold ring. 'See--here's some nice roast chicken or some veal stew. Why don't you have a little supper with me?'  'No, thanks.",0
7240,All I want is the sundae and the beer. Both plenty cold.' Mick raked her hair from her forehead. Her mouth was open so that her cheeks seemed hollow. There were these two things she could never believe. That Mister Singer had killed himself and was dead. And that she was grown and had to work at Woolworth's.,0
7241,"She was the one found him. They had thought the noise was a backfire from a car, and it was not until the next day that they knew. She went in to play the radio. The blood was all over his neck and when her Dad came he pushed her out the room. She had run from the house. The shock wouldn't let her be still. She had run into the dark and hit herself with her fists. And then the next night he was in a coffin in the living-room. The undertaker had put rouge and lipstick on his face to make him look natural. But he didn't look natural. He was very dead. And mixed with the smell of flowers there was this other smell so that she couldn't stay in the room. But through all those days she held down the job. She wrapped packages and handed them across the counter and rung the money in the till. She walked when she was supposed to walk and ate when she sat down to the table. Only at first when she went to bed at night she couldn't sleep. But now she slept like she was supposed to, also.",0
7242,Mick turned sideways in the seat so that she could cross her legs. There was a run in her stocking. It had started while she was walking to work and she had spit on it. Then later the run had gone farther and she had stuck a little piece of chewing-gum on the end. But even that didn't help. Now she would have to go home and sew. It was hard to know what she could do about stockings. She wore them out so fast. Unless she was the kind of common girl that would wear cotton stockings.,0
7243,She oughtn't to have come in here. The bottoms of her shoes were clean worn out. She ought to have saved the twenty cents toward a new half-sole. Because if she kept on standing on a shoe with a hole in it what would happen? A blister would come on her foot. And she would have to pick it with a burnt needle. She would have to stay home from work and be fired. And then what would happen?,0
7244,"'Here you are,' said Mister Brannon. ' But I never heard of such a combination before. '",0
7245,"He put the sundae and the beer on the table. She pretended to clean her fingernails because if she noticed him he would start talking. He didn't have this grudge against her any more, so he must have forgotten about the pack of gum. Now he always wanted to talk to her. But she wanted to be quiet and by herself. The sundae was O.K., covered all over with chocolate and nuts and cherries. And the beer was relaxing. The beer had a nice bitter taste after the ice cream and it made her drunk. Next to music beer was best.",0
7246,But now no music was in her mind. That was a funny thing. It was like she was shut out from the inside room. Sometimes a quick little tune would come and go--but she never went into the inside room with music like she used to do. It was like she was too tense. Or maybe because it was like the store took all her energy and time. Woolworth's wasn't the same as school. When she used to come home from school she felt good and was ready to start working on the music. But now she was always too tired. At home she just ate supper and slept and then ate breakfast and went off to the store again. A song she had started in her private notebook two months before was still not finished. And she wanted to stay in the inside room but she didn't know how. It was like the inside room was locked somewhere away from her. A very hard thing to understand.,0
7247,Mick pushed her broken front tooth with her thumb. But she did have Mister Singer's radio. All the installments hadn't been paid and she took on the responsibility. It was good to have something that had belonged to him. And maybe one of these days she might be able to set aside a little for a second-hand piano. Say two bucks a week. And she wouldn't let anybody touch this private piano but her--only she might teach George little pieces. She would keep it in the back room and play on it every night. And all day Sunday. But then suppose some week she couldn't make a payment. So then would they come to take it away like the little red bicycle? And suppose like she wouldn't let them. Suppose she hid the piano under the house. Or else she would meet them at the front door. And fight. She would knock down both the two men so they would have shiners and broke noses and would be passed out on the hall floor.,0
7248,"Mick frowned and rubbed her fist hard across her forehead. That was the way things were. It was like she was mad all the time. Not how a kid gets mad quick so that soon it is all over--but in another way. Only there was nothing to be mad at. Unless the store. But the store hadn't asked her to take the job. So there was nothing to be mad at. It was like she was cheated. Only nobody had cheated her. So there was nobody to take it out on. However, just the same she had that feeling. Cheated.",0
7249,But maybe it would be true about the piano and turn out O.K. Maybe she would get a chance soon. Else what the hell good had it all been--the way she felt about music and the plans she had made in the inside room? It had to be some good if anything made sense. And it was too and it was too and it was too and it was too. It was some good.,0
7250,"All right!  O.K.! Some good. [4] Night   All was serene. As Biff dried his face and hands a breeze tinkled the glass pendants of the little Japanese pagoda on the table. He had just awaked from a nap and had smoked his night cigar. He thought of Blount and wondered if by now he had traveled far. A bottle of Agua Florida was on the bathroom shelf and he touched the stopper to his temples. He whistled an old song, and as he descended the narrow stairs the tune left a broken echo behind him.",0
7251,Louis was supposed to be on duty behind the counter. But he had soldiered on the job and the place was deserted. The front door stood open to the empty street. The clock on the wall pointed to seventeen minutes before midnight. The radio was on and there was talk about the crisis Hitler had cooked up over Danzig. He went back to the kitchen and found Louis asleep in a chair. The boy had taken off his shoes and unbuttoned his trousers. His head drooped on his chest. A long wet spot on his shirt showed that he had been sleeping a good while. His arms hung straight down at his sides and the wonder was he did not fall forward on his face. He slept soundly and there was no use to wake him. The night would be a quiet one.,0
7252,"Biff tiptoed across the kitchen to a shelf which held a basket of tea olive and two water pitchers full of zinnias. He carried the flowers up to the front of the restaurant and removed the cellophane-wrapped platters of the last special from the display window. He was sick of food. A window of fresh summer flowers--that would be good. His eyes were closed as he imagined how it could be arranged. A foundation of the tea olive strewn over the bottom, cool and green. The red pottery tub filled with the brilliant zinnias. Nothing more. He began to arrange the window carefully. Among the flowers there was a freak plant, a zinnia with six bronze petals and two red. He examined this curio and laid it aside to save. Then the window was finished and he stood in the street to regard his handiwork. The awkward stems of the flowers had been bent to just the right degree of restful looseness. The electric lights detracted, but when the sun rose the display would show at its best advantage. Downright artistic.",0
7253,"The black, starlit sky seemed close to the earth. He strolled along the sidewalk, pausing once to knock an orange peel into the gutter with the side of his foot. At the far end of the next block two men, small from the distance and motionless, stood arm in arm together. No one else could be seen. His place was the only store on all the street with an open door and lights inside.",0
7254,"And why? What was the reason for keeping the place open all through the night when every other café in the town was closed? He was often asked that question and could never speak the answer out in words. Not money. Sometimes a party would come for beer and scrambled eggs and spend five or ten dollars. But that was rare. Mostly they came one at a time and ordered little and stayed long. And on some nights, between the hours of twelve and five o'clock, not a customer would enter. There was no profit in it--that was plain.",0
7255,"But he would never close up for the night--not as long as he stayed in the business. Night was the time. There were those he would never have seen otherwise. A few came regularly several times a week. Others had come into the place only once, had drunk a Coca-Cola, and never returned.",0
7256,Biff folded his arms across his chest and walked more slowly. Inside the arc of the street light his shadow showed angular and black. The peaceful silence of the night settled in him. These were the hours for rest and meditation. Maybe that was why he stayed downstairs and did not sleep. With a last quick glance he scanned the empty street and went inside.,0
7257,"The crisis voice still talked on the radio. The fans on the ceiling made a soothing whir. From the kitchen came the sound of Louis snoring. He thought suddenly of poor Willie and decided to send him a quart of whiskey sometime soon. He turned to the crossword puzzle in the newspaper. There was a picture of a woman to identify in the center. He recognized her and wrote the name--Mona Lisa--across the first spaces. Number one down was a word for beggar, beginning with m and nine letters long. Mendicant. Two horizontal was some word meaning to remove afar off. A six-letter word beginning with e. Elapse? He sounded trial combinations of letters aloud. Eloign. But he had lost interest. There were puzzles enough without this kind. He folded and put away the paper. He would come back to it later.",0
7258,"He examined the zinnia he had intended to save. As he held it in the palm of his hand to the light the flower was not such a curious specimen after all. Not worth saving. He plucked the soft, bright petals and the last one came out on love. But who? Who would he be loving now? No one person. Anybody decent who came in out of the street to sit for an hour and have a drink. But no one person. He had known his loves and they were over. Alice, Madeline and Gyp. Finished. Leaving him either better or worse. Which? However you looked at it.",0
7259,"And Mick. The one who in the last months had lived so strangely in his heart. Was that love done with too? Yes. It was finished. Early in the evenings Mick came in for a cold drink or a sundae. She had grown older. Her rough and childish ways were almost gone. And instead there was something ladylike and delicate about her that was hard to point out. The earrings, the dangle of her bracelets, and the new way she crossed her legs and pulled the hem of her skirt down past her knees. He watched her and felt only a sort of gentleness. In him the old feeling was gone. For a year this love had blossomed strangely. He had questioned it a hundred times and found no answer. And now, as a summer flower shatters in September, it was finished. There was no one.",0
7260,"Biff tapped his nose with his forefinger. A foreign voice was now speaking on the radio. He could not decide for certain whether the voice was German, French, or Spanish. But it sounded like doom. It gave him the jitters to listen to it. When he turned it off the silence was deep and unbroken. He felt the night outside. Loneliness gripped him so that his breath quickened. It was far too late to call Lucile on the telephone and speak to Baby. Nor could he expect a customer to enter at this hour. He went to the door and looked up and down the street. All was empty and dark.",0
7261,"'Louis!' he called. 'Are you awake, Louis?'",0
7262,No answer. He put his elbows on the counter and held his head in his hands. He moved his dark bearded jaw from side to side and slowly his forehead lowered in a frown.,0
7263,"The riddle. The question that had taken root in him and would not let him rest. The puzzle of Singer and the rest of them. More than a year had gone by since it had started. More than a year since Blount had hung around the place on his first long drunk and seen the mute for the first time. Since Mick had begun to follow him in and out. And now for a month Singer had been dead and buried. And the riddle was still in him, so that he could not be tranquil. There was something not natural about it all--something like an ugly joke. When he thought of it he felt uneasy and in some unknown way afraid.",0
7264,"He had managed about the funeral. They had left all that to him. Singer's affairs were in a mess. There were installments due on everything he owed and the beneficiary of his life insurance was deceased. There was just enough to bury him. The funeral was at noon. The sun burned down on them with savage heat as they stood around the open dank grave. The flowers curled and turned brown in the sun. Mick cried so hard that she choked herself and her father had to beat her on the back. Blount scowled down at the grave with his fist to his mouth. The town's colored doctor, who was somehow related to poor Willie, stood on the edge of the crowd and moaned to himself. And there were strangers nobody had ever seen or heard of before. God knows where they came from or why they were there.",0
7265,"The silence in the room was deep as the night itself. Biff stood transfixed, lost in his meditations. Then suddenly he felt a quickening in him. His heart turned and he leaned his back against the counter for support. For in a swift radiance of illumination he saw a glimpse of human struggle and of valor. Of the endless fluid passage of humanity through endless time. And of those who labor and of those who--one word--love. His soul expanded. But for a moment only. For in him he felt a warning, a shaft of terror. Between the two worlds he was suspended. He saw that he was looking at his own face in the counter glass before him. Sweat glistened on his temples and his face was contorted. One eye was opened wider than the other. The left eye delved narrowly into the past while the right gazed wide and affrighted into a future of blackness, error, and ruin. And he was suspended between radiance and darkness. Between bitter irony and faith. Sharply he turned away.",0
7266,'Louis!' he called. 'Louis! Louis!'  Again there was no answer.,0
7267,"But, motherogod, was he a sensible man or was he not? And how could this terror throttle him like this when he didn't even know what caused it? And would he just stand here like a jittery ninny or would he pull himself together and be reasonable? For after all was he a sensible man or was he not? Biff wet his handkerchief beneath the water tap and patted his drawn, tense face. Somehow he remembered that the awning had not yet been raised. As he went to the door his walk gained steadiness. And when at last he was inside again he composed himself soberly to await the morning sun.",0
7268,"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since. “Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.” He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.",0
7269,"And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.",0
7270,"My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today. I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, “Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.",0
7271,"The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog—at least I had him for a few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.",0
7272,"It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road. “How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.",0
7273,"I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighbourhood.",0
7274,"And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer. There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” This isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.",0
7275,"It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.",0
7276,"I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month.",0
7277,"Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.",0
7278,"Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of anticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.",0
7279,"Why they came East I don’t know. They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.",0
7280,"And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.",0
7281,"He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.",0
7282,"His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts. “Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.",0
7283,"We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch. “I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly. Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore.",0
7284,"“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. “We’ll go inside.”",0
7285,"We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.",0
7286,"The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.",0
7287,"The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.",0
7288,"The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room. “I’m p-paralysed with happiness.” She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)",0
7289,"At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.",0
7290,"I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.",0
7291,"I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me. “Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.",0
7292,"“The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along the north shore.”  “How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!” Then she added irrelevantly: “You ought to see the baby.”",0
7293,“I’d like to.” “She’s asleep. She’s three years old. Haven’t you ever seen her?”  “Never.”,0
7294,"“Well, you ought to see her. She’s—”  Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder. “What you doing, Nick?”  “I’m a bond man.”",0
7295,"“Who with?”  I told him. “Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively. This annoyed me.",0
7296,"“You will,” I answered shortly. “You will if you stay in the East.” “Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. “I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”",0
7297,"At this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that I started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.",0
7298,"“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.”  “Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you to New York all afternoon.” “No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry. “I’m absolutely in training.”",0
7299,Her host looked at her incredulously. “You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. “How you ever get anything done is beyond me.”,0
7300,"I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.",0
7301,"“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “I know somebody there.” “I don’t know a single—”  “You must know Gatsby.”  “Gatsby?” demanded Daisy.",0
7302,"“What Gatsby?” Before I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square. Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.",0
7303,"“Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her fingers. “In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” She looked at us all radiantly. “Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.”",0
7304,"“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed. “All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to me helplessly: “What do people plan?”  Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger.",0
7305,“Look!” she complained; “I hurt it.” We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.,0
7306,"“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly. “I know you didn’t mean to, but you did do it. That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—”  “I hate that word ‘hulking,’ ” objected Tom crossly, “even in kidding.”",0
7307,"“Hulking,” insisted Daisy. Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.",0
7308,"“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. “Can’t you talk about crops or something?”  I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way. “Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?”  “Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.",0
7309,"“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”  “Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness.",0
7310,"“He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we—”  “Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.”",0
7311,"“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun. “You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair. “This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. “—And we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that. Do you see?”  There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.",0
7312,"When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned towards me. “I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically. “It’s about the butler’s nose. Do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?”  “That’s why I came over tonight.”",0
7313,"“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose—”  “Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker. “Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.”",0
7314,"For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk. The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.",0
7315,"“I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation: “An absolute rose?”",0
7316,"This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.",0
7317,"Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh!” in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.",0
7318,“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—” I began. “Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”  “Is something happening?”,0
7319,"I inquired innocently. “You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised. “I thought everybody knew.”",0
7320,“I don’t.” “Why—” she said hesitantly. “Tom’s got some woman in New York.”  “Got some woman?”,0
7321,"I repeated blankly. Miss Baker nodded. “She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. Don’t you think?”  Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.",0
7322,"“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety. She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s singing away—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”  “Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”",0
7323,"The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.",0
7324,"The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.",0
7325,"Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl. “We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly. “Even if we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.”",0
7326,"“I wasn’t back from the war.” “That’s true.” She hesitated. “Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick, and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”",0
7327,"Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter. “I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”",0
7328,"“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently. “Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?”  “Very much.”",0
7329,"“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’",0
7330,"“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a convinced way. “Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I know. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.” Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated—God, I’m sophisticated!”",0
7331,"The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.",0
7332,"Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.",0
7333,"When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand. “To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in our very next issue.” Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.",0
7334,"“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. “Time for this good girl to go to bed.”  “Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy, “over at Westchester.” “Oh—you’re Jordan Baker.”  I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach.",0
7335,"I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago. “Good night,” she said softly. “Wake me at eight, won’t you.”",0
7336,"“If you’ll get up.”  “I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.”",0
7337,"“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy. “In fact I think I’ll arrange a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of—oh—fling you together. You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—”  “Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs.",0
7338,"“I haven’t heard a word.” “She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment. “They oughtn’t to let her run around the country this way.”  “Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.",0
7339,"“Her family.”  “Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick’s going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going to spend lots of weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very good for her.”  Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.",0
7340,“Is she from New York?” I asked quickly. “From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our beautiful white—”  “Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?”,0
7341,"demanded Tom suddenly. “Did I?” She looked at me. “I can’t seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know—”  “Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.",0
7342,"I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called: “Wait!”  “I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important.",0
7343,"We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.” “That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly. “We heard that you were engaged.”",0
7344,"“It’s a libel. I’m too poor.” “But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way. “We heard it from three people, so it must be true.”",0
7345,"Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come East. You can’t stop going with an old friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumoured into marriage.",0
7346,"Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.",0
7347,"Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.",0
7348,"I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him, for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.",0
7349,"II About halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of ash-grey men, who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.",0
7350,"But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.",0
7351,"The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and, when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress. The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafés with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire to meet her—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train one afternoon, and when we stopped by the ash-heaps he jumped to his feet and, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.",0
7352,"“We’re getting off,” he insisted. “I want you to meet my girl.” I think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination to have my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.",0
7353,"I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg’s persistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a garage—Repairs. George B. Wilson. Cars bought and sold.—and I followed Tom inside.",0
7354,"The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands on a piece of waste. He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes.",0
7355,"“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping him jovially on the shoulder. “How’s business?”  “I can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvincingly. “When are you going to sell me that car?”  “Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.”  “Works pretty slow, don’t he?”  “No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly.",0
7356,"“And if you feel that way about it, maybe I’d better sell it somewhere else after all.” “I don’t mean that,” explained Wilson quickly. “I just meant—”  His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage.",0
7357,"Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her flesh sensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips, and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:  “Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.”",0
7358,"“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls. A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom. “I want to see you,” said Tom intently. “Get on the next train.”  “All right.”",0
7359,"“I’ll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level.” She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door. We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.",0
7360,"“Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg. “Awful.”  “It does her good to get away.” “Doesn’t her husband object?”  “Wilson?",0
7361,"He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He’s so dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.” So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train.",0
7362,"She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York. At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a moving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the front glass.",0
7363,"“I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly. “I want to get one for the apartment. They’re nice to have—a dog.”",0
7364,"We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed. “What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.",0
7365,"“All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”  “I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got that kind?”  The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck. “That’s no police dog,” said Tom.",0
7366,"“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment in his voice. “It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over the brown washrag of a back. “Look at that coat. Some coat. That’s a dog that’ll never bother you with catching cold.”",0
7367,"“I think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. “How much is it?”  “That dog?” He looked at it admiringly. “That dog will cost you ten dollars.”",0
7368,"The Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the weatherproof coat with rapture. “Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.",0
7369,"“That dog? That dog’s a boy.” “It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. “Here’s your money. Go and buy ten more dogs with it.”",0
7370,"We drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon. I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner. “Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here.”",0
7371,"“No you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly. “Myrtle’ll be hurt if you don’t come up to the apartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?”  “Come on,” she urged.",0
7372,"“I’ll telephone my sister Catherine. She’s said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.” “Well, I’d like to, but—”  We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.",0
7373,"At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases, and went haughtily in. “I’m going to have the McKees come up,” she announced as we rose in the elevator. “And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.”",0
7374,"The apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked bureau door.",0
7375,"I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although until after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful sun. Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at the drugstore on the corner. When I came back they had both disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a chapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or the whisky distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to me.",0
7376,"Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment door. The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.",0
7377,"Mr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He informed me that he was in the “artistic game,” and I gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs. Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been married.",0
7378,"Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.",0
7379,"“My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, “most of these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me the bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out.”",0
7380,“What was the name of the woman?” asked Mrs. McKee. “Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own homes.”,0
7381,"“I like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, “I think it’s adorable.” Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain. “It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said. “I just slip it on sometimes when I don’t care what I look like.”",0
7382,"“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,” pursued Mrs. McKee. “If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.” We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.",0
7383,"“I should change the light,” he said after a moment. “I’d like to bring out the modelling of the features. And I’d try to get hold of all the back hair.”",0
7384,"“I wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried Mrs. McKee. “I think it’s—”  Her husband said “Sh!” and we all looked at the subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.",0
7385,"“You McKees have something to drink,” he said. “Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.” “I told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. “These people! You have to keep after them all the time.”",0
7386,"She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there. “I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,” asserted Mr. McKee.",0
7387,"Tom looked at him blankly. “Two of them we have framed downstairs.”  “Two what?” demanded Tom. “Two studies. One of them I call Montauk Point—The Gulls, and the other I call Montauk Point—The Sea.”",0
7388,"The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch. “Do you live down on Long Island, too?” she inquired. “I live at West Egg.”  “Really?",0
7389,I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby’s. Do you know him?”  “I live next door to him.”,0
7390,"“Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. That’s where all his money comes from.”  “Really?”  She nodded. “I’m scared of him. I’d hate to have him get anything on me.”",0
7391,"This absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs. McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:  “Chester, I think you could do something with her,” she broke out, but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom. “I’d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry. All I ask is that they should give me a start.”  “Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray.",0
7392,"“She’ll give you a letter of introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?”  “Do what?” she asked, startled. “You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can do some studies of him.” His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented, “ ‘George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,’ or something like that.”",0
7393,"Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear:  “Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.” “Can’t they?”  “Can’t stand them.” She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. “What I say is, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them? If I was them I’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away.”  “Doesn’t she like Wilson either?”  The answer to this was unexpected.",0
7394,"It came from Myrtle, who had overheard the question, and it was violent and obscene. “You see,” cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again. “It’s really his wife that’s keeping them apart. She’s a Catholic, and they don’t believe in divorce.”",0
7395,"Daisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie. “When they do get married,” continued Catherine, “they’re going West to live for a while until it blows over.” “It’d be more discreet to go to Europe.”",0
7396,"“Oh, do you like Europe?” she exclaimed surprisingly. “I just got back from Monte Carlo.”  “Really.”",0
7397,"“Just last year. I went over there with another girl.” “Stay long?”  “No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back.",0
7398,"We went by way of Marseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!”",0
7399,"The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room. “I almost made a mistake, too,” she declared vigorously. “I almost married a little kike who’d been after me for years. I knew he was below me. Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s way below you!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got me sure.”",0
7400,"“Yes, but listen,” said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down, “at least you didn’t marry him.” “I know I didn’t.” “Well, I married him,” said Myrtle, ambiguously. “And that’s the difference between your case and mine.”",0
7401,"“Why did you, Myrtle?” demanded Catherine. “Nobody forced you to.”  Myrtle considered. “I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,” she said finally. “I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’t fit to lick my shoe.”",0
7402,"“You were crazy about him for a while,” said Catherine. “Crazy about him!” cried Myrtle incredulously. “Who said I was crazy about him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there.”",0
7403,"She pointed suddenly at me, and everyone looked at me accusingly. I tried to show by my expression that I expected no affection. “The only crazy I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a mistake. He borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in, and never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out: ‘Oh, is that your suit?’ I said. ‘This is the first I ever heard about it.’ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon.”",0
7404,"“She really ought to get away from him,” resumed Catherine to me. “They’ve been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom’s the first sweetie she ever had.”",0
7405,"The bottle of whisky—a second one—was now in constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine, who “felt just as good on nothing at all.” Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight, but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.",0
7406,"Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom. “It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subway train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live forever; you can’t live forever.’ ”  She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter.",0
7407,"“My dear,” she cried, “I’m going to give you this dress as soon as I’m through with it. I’ve got to get another one tomorrow. I’m going to make a list of all the things I’ve got to get. A massage and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s grave that’ll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won’t forget all the things I got to do.”",0
7408,"It was nine o’clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch and found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon.",0
7409,"The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to mention Daisy’s name.",0
7410,"“Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!” shouted Mrs. Wilson. “I’ll say it whenever I want to! Daisy! Dai—”  Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his open hand.",0
7411,"Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women’s voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door. When he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the scene—his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and the despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of Versailles. Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door. Taking my hat from the chandelier, I followed.",0
7412,"“Come to lunch some day,” he suggested, as we groaned down in the elevator. “Where?”  “Anywhere.”  “Keep your hands off the lever,” snapped the elevator boy. “I beg your pardon,” said Mr. McKee with dignity, “I didn’t know I was touching it.”",0
7413,"“All right,” I agreed, “I’ll be glad to.”  … I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands. “Beauty and the Beast… Loneliness… Old Grocery Horse… Brook’n Bridge…”  Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning Tribune, and waiting for the four o’clock train. III There was music from my neighbour’s house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. On weekends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.",0
7414,"Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler’s thumb. At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.",0
7415,"By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours, and hair bobbed in strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other’s names.",0
7416,"The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour under the constantly changing light.",0
7417,"Suddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray’s understudy from the Follies. The party has begun.",0
7418,"I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not invited—they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door. Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated with an amusement park. Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission.",0
7419,"I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin’s-egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer: the honour would be entirely Gatsby’s, it said, if I would attend his “little party” that night. He had seen me several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it—signed Jay Gatsby, in a majestic hand.  Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn’t know—though here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train.",0
7420,"I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key.",0
7421,"As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements, that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone. I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden. Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby.",0
7422,"“Hello!” I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.",0
7423,"“I thought you might be here,” she responded absently as I came up. “I remembered you lived next door to—”  She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at the foot of the steps. “Hello!” they cried together. “Sorry you didn’t win.”",0
7424,"That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week before. “You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but we met you here about a month ago.”",0
7425,"“You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked Jordan, and I started, but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer’s basket. With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.",0
7426,"“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired Jordan of the girl beside her. “The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in an alert confident voice. She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for you, Lucille?”  It was for Lucille, too.",0
7427,"“I like to come,” Lucille said. “I never care what I do, so I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.”",0
7428,"“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan. “Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.”  “There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,” said the other girl eagerly.",0
7429,“He doesn’t want any trouble with anybody.” “Who doesn’t?” I inquired.,0
7430,“Gatsby. Somebody told me—”  The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially. “Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.”,0
7431,"A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly. “I don’t think it’s so much that,” argued Lucille sceptically; “It’s more that he was a German spy during the war.”",0
7432,"One of the men nodded in confirmation. “I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany,” he assured us positively. “Oh, no,” said the first girl, “it couldn’t be that, because he was in the American army during the war.” As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. “You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody’s looking at him. I’ll bet he killed a man.”",0
7433,She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.,0
7434,"The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gaiety.",0
7435,"“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour; “this is much too polite for me.” We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.",0
7436,"The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not there. She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.",0
7437,"A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot. “What do you think?” he demanded impetuously.",0
7438,“About what?”  He waved his hand toward the bookshelves. “About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They’re real.”,0
7439,"“The books?”  He nodded. “Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought they’d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real. Pages and—Here! Lemme show you.”",0
7440,"Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures. “See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco. It’s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too—didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?”  He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse.",0
7441,"“Who brought you?” he demanded. “Or did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought.”  Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.",0
7442,"“I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,” he continued. “Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.”  “Has it?”  “A little bit, I think.",0
7443,I can’t tell yet. I’ve only been here an hour. Did I tell you about the books? They’re real. They’re—”  “You told us.”,0
7444,"We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors. There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individually or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and between the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.",0
7445,"I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.",0
7446,"At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled. “Your face is familiar,” he said politely. “Weren’t you in the First Division during the war?”  “Why yes.",0
7447,I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry.” “I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I’d seen you somewhere before.”,0
7448,"We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning. “Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.”  “What time?”  “Any time that suits you best.”",0
7449,"It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled. “Having a gay time now?” she inquired. “Much better.” I turned again to my new acquaintance. “This is an unusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the host. I live over there—” I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.”",0
7450,"For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand. “I’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly. “What!” I exclaimed. “Oh, I beg your pardon.”",0
7451,"“I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.” He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.",0
7452,"Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn. “If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,” he urged me. “Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.”",0
7453,When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years. “Who is he?” I demanded. “Do you know?”  “He’s just a man named Gatsby.”,0
7454,"“Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?”  “Now you’re started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile. “Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man.”",0
7455,"A dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next remark it faded away. “However, I don’t believe it.” “Why not?”  “I don’t know,” she insisted, “I just don’t think he went there.”",0
7456,"Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible. But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.",0
7457,"“Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete. “And I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”",0
7458,"There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden. “Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried. “At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladmir Tostoff’s latest work, which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers you know there was a big sensation.” He smiled with jovial condescension, and added: “Some sensation!” Whereupon everybody laughed.",0
7459,"“The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as ‘Vladmir Tostoff’s Jazz History of the World!’ ”  The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When the “Jazz History of the World” was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link.",0
7460,"“I beg your pardon.” Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us. “Miss Baker?” he inquired. “I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.”",0
7461,"“With me?” she exclaimed in surprise. “Yes, madame.”",0
7462,"She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings. I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside.",0
7463,"The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and went off into a deep vinous sleep.",0
7464,"“She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,” explained a girl at my elbow. I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan’s party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed: “You promised!” into his ear.",0
7465,The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices.,0
7466,“Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home.”  “Never heard anything so selfish in my life.” “We’re always the first ones to leave.” “So are we.”,0
7467,"“Well, we’re almost the last tonight,” said one of the men sheepishly. “The orchestra left half an hour ago.” In spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted, kicking, into the night.",0
7468,"As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye. Jordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she lingered for a moment to shake hands.",0
7469,"“I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,” she whispered. “How long were we in there?”  “Why, about an hour.” “It was… simply amazing,” she repeated abstractedly. “But I swore I wouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.” She yawned gracefully in my face. “Please come and see me… Phone book… Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard… My aunt…” She was hurrying off as she talked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door.",0
7470,"Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I joined the last of Gatsby’s guests, who were clustered around him. I wanted to explain that I’d hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden. “Don’t mention it,” he enjoined me eagerly. “Don’t give it another thought, old sport.” The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. “And don’t forget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine o’clock.”",0
7471,"Then the butler, behind his shoulder:  “Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.” “All right, in a minute. Tell them I’ll be right there… Good night.”",0
7472,"“Good night.”  “Good night.” He smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the time. “Good night, old sport… Good night.”",0
7473,"But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.",0
7474,"A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the tyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way. “See!” he explained. “It went in the ditch.”",0
7475,"The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s library. “How’d it happen?”  He shrugged his shoulders. “I know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he said decisively.",0
7476,"“But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?”  “Don’t ask me,” said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter. “I know very little about driving—next to nothing. It happened, and that’s all I know.”",0
7477,"“Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.”  “But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly, “I wasn’t even trying.” An awed hush fell upon the bystanders. “Do you want to commit suicide?”  “You’re lucky it was just a wheel!",0
7478,"A bad driver and not even trying!”  “You don’t understand,” explained the criminal. “I wasn’t driving. There’s another man in the car.”",0
7479,"The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained “Ah-h-h!” as the door of the coupé swung slowly open. The crowd—it was now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.",0
7480,"Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster. “Wha’s matter?” he inquired calmly. “Did we run outa gas?”  “Look!”  Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.",0
7481,"“It came off,” someone explained. He nodded. “At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.”",0
7482,"A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders, he remarked in a determined voice:  “Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?”  At least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond. “Back out,” he suggested after a moment. “Put her in reverse.”",0
7483,"“But the wheel’s off!” He hesitated. “No harm in trying,” he said.",0
7484,"The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before, and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.",0
7485,"Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs. Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away.",0
7486,"I took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.",0
7487,"I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.",0
7488,"Again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. Imagining that I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well.",0
7489,"For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her, because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. Then it was something more. I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy’s. At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approached the proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.",0
7490,"Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest. She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.",0
7491,"It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man’s coat.",0
7492,"“You’re a rotten driver,” I protested. “Either you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.”  “I am careful.” “No, you’re not.”",0
7493,"“Well, other people are,” she said lightly. “What’s that got to do with it?”  “They’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “It takes two to make an accident.”",0
7494,"“Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.” “I hope I never will,” she answered. “I hate careless people. That’s why I like you.”  Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her.",0
7495,"But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. I’d been writing letters once a week and signing them: “Love, Nick,” and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.",0
7496,"Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known. IV On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore, the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn. “He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers. “One time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil. Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass.”",0
7497,"Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of those who came to Gatsby’s house that summer. It is an old timetable now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922.” But I can still read the grey names, and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him.",0
7498,"From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a man named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who was drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrystie’s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.",0
7499,"Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies came, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice A. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and Beluga’s girls.",0
7500,"From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid, who controlled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartz (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B. (“Rot-Gut”) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day.",0
7501,"A man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as “the boarder”—I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Myer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.",0
7502,"Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have forgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to be.",0
7503,"In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O’Brien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had his nose shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be her chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten. All these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer. At nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three-noted horn.",0
7504,"It was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach. “Good morning, old sport. You’re having lunch with me today and I thought we’d ride up together.”",0
7505,"He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.",0
7506,"He saw me looking with admiration at his car. “It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?” He jumped off to give me a better view. “Haven’t you ever seen it before?”  I’d seen it.",0
7507,"Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream colour, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we started to town.",0
7508,"I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door. And then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn’t reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured suit.",0
7509,"“Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly, “what’s your opinion of me, anyhow?” A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves. “Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted. “I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.”",0
7510,"So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation in his halls. “I’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. “I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West—all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition.”",0
7511,"He looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if there wasn’t something a little sinister about him, after all.",0
7512,“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually. “San Francisco.”  “I see.” “My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.”,0
7513,"His voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise. “After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.”",0
7514,"With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne. “Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I took the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave me a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!”  Little Montenegro!",0
7515,He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from Montenegro’s warm little heart. My incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines.,0
7516,"He reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell into my palm. “That’s the one from Montenegro.” To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. “Orderi di Danilo,” ran the circular legend, “Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.”  “Turn it.”",0
7517,"“Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour Extraordinary.”  “Here’s another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It was taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.”",0
7518,"It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby, looking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand. Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.",0
7519,"“I’m going to make a big request of you today,” he said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction, “so I thought you ought to know something about me. I didn’t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me.” He hesitated. “You’ll hear about it this afternoon.”",0
7520,"“At lunch?”  “No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you’re taking Miss Baker to tea.” “Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?”  “No, old sport, I’m not.",0
7521,"But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter.” I hadn’t the faintest idea what “this matter” was, but I was more annoyed than interested. I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’d ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.",0
7522,"He wouldn’t say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted oceangoing ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by.",0
7523,"With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Astoria—only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated I heard the familiar “jug-jug-spat!” of a motorcycle, and a frantic policeman rode alongside. “All right, old sport,” called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white card from his wallet, he waved it before the man’s eyes.",0
7524,"“Right you are,” agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. “Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!”",0
7525,"“What was that?” I inquired. “The picture of Oxford?”  “I was able to do the commissioner a favour once, and he sends me a Christmas card every year.”",0
7526,"Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of nonolfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world. A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for friends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby’s splendid car was included in their sombre holiday. As we crossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry.",0
7527,"“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought; “anything at all…”  Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder. Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby for lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.",0
7528,"“Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.” A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.",0
7529,"“—So I took one look at him,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand earnestly, “and what do you think I did?”  “What?” I inquired politely. But evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.",0
7530,"“I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: ‘All right, Katspaugh, don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’ He shut it then and there.” Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.",0
7531,"“Highballs?” asked the head waiter. “This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. “But I like across the street better!”",0
7532,"“Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: “It’s too hot over there.” “Hot and small—yes,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “but full of memories.”  “What place is that?” I asked.",0
7533,"“The old Metropole.” “The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. “Filled with faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can’t forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. ‘All right,’ says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his chair.",0
7534,"“ ‘Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don’t you, so help me, move outside this room.’ “It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the blinds we’d of seen daylight.” “Did he go?” I asked innocently.",0
7535,"“Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at me indignantly. “He turned around in the door and says: ‘Don’t let that waiter take away my coffee!’ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away.”",0
7536,"“Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remembering. “Five, with Becker.” His nostrils turned to me in an interested way. “I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion.”",0
7537,"The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for me:  “Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man.”  “No?” Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.",0
7538,"“This is just a friend. I told you we’d talk about that some other time.” “I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “I had a wrong man.”",0
7539,"A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table.",0
7540,"“Look here, old sport,” said Gatsby, leaning toward me, “I’m afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car.” There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it. “I don’t like mysteries,” I answered, “and I don’t understand why you won’t come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?”  “Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me.",0
7541,"“Miss Baker’s a great sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all right.” Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room, leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table. “He has to telephone,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his eyes. “Fine fellow, isn’t he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.”",0
7542,“Yes.”  “He’s an Oggsford man.” “Oh!”  “He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?”  “I’ve heard of it.”,0
7543,"“It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.”  “Have you known Gatsby for a long time?” I inquired. “Several years,” he answered in a gratified way. “I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister.’ ” He paused. “I see you’re looking at my cuff buttons.”",0
7544,"I hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory. “Finest specimens of human molars,” he informed me.",0
7545,“Well!” I inspected them. “That’s a very interesting idea.”,0
7546,"“Yeah.” He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. “Yeah, Gatsby’s very careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend’s wife.”",0
7547,"When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet. “I have enjoyed my lunch,” he said, “and I’m going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome.”  “Don’t hurry Meyer,” said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction.",0
7548,"“You’re very polite, but I belong to another generation,” he announced solemnly. “You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your—” He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand. “As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won’t impose myself on you any longer.”",0
7549,"As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I wondered if I had said anything to offend him. “He becomes very sentimental sometimes,” explained Gatsby. “This is one of his sentimental days. He’s quite a character around New York—a denizen of Broadway.”",0
7550,"“Who is he, anyhow, an actor?”  “No.”  “A dentist?”  “Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he’s a gambler.” Gatsby hesitated, then added, coolly: “He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”",0
7551,"“Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated. The idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World’s Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people—with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.",0
7552,“How did he happen to do that?” I asked after a minute. “He just saw the opportunity.”,0
7553,"“Why isn’t he in jail?”  “They can’t get him, old sport. He’s a smart man.” I insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.",0
7554,"“Come along with me for a minute,” I said; “I’ve got to say hello to someone.” When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction. “Where’ve you been?” he demanded eagerly. “Daisy’s furious because you haven’t called up.”  “This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”",0
7555,"They shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby’s face. “How’ve you been, anyhow?” demanded Tom of me. “How’d you happen to come up this far to eat?”  “I’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.”",0
7556,"I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there. One October day in nineteen-seventeen—  (said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)  —I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut, in a disapproving way.",0
7557,"The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay’s house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night. “Anyways, for an hour!”",0
7558,"When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn’t see me until I was five feet away. “Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly. “Please come here.”",0
7559,"I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross to make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn’t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn’t lay eyes on him again for over four years—even after I’d met him on Long Island I didn’t realize it was the same man.",0
7560,"That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very often. She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone at all. Wild rumours were circulating about her—how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers any more, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town, who couldn’t get into the army at all.",0
7561,"By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a début after the armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago, with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.",0
7562,"I was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.",0
7563,"“ ’Gratulate me,” she muttered. “Never had a drink before, but oh how I do enjoy it.”  “What’s the matter, Daisy?”  I was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that before. “Here, dearies.” She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. “Take ’em downstairs and give ’em back to whoever they belong to. Tell ’em all Daisy’s change’ her mine. Say: ‘Daisy’s change’ her mine!’ ”  She began to cry—she cried and cried.",0
7564,"I rushed out and found her mother’s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She wouldn’t let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.",0
7565,"But she didn’t say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o’clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a three months’ trip to the South Seas.",0
7566,"I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I’d never seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a minute she’d look around uneasily, and say: “Where’s Tom gone?” and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together—it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night, and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.",0
7567,"The next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and then they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation. Perhaps because she doesn’t drink. It’s a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all—and yet there’s something in that voice of hers…",0
7568,"Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years. It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said: “What Gatsby?” and when I described him—I was half asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know. It wasn’t until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car.",0
7569,"When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park. The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties, and the clear voices of children, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:  “I’m the Sheik of Araby. Your love belongs to me. At night when you’re asleep Into your tent I’ll creep—”  “It was a strange coincidence,” I said.",0
7570,"“But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.”  “Why not?”  “Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.” Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendour.",0
7571,"“He wants to know,” continued Jordan, “if you’ll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over.” The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths—so that he could “come over” some afternoon to a stranger’s garden.",0
7572,"“Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?”  “He’s afraid, he’s waited so long. He thought you might be offended. You see, he’s regular tough underneath it all.”",0
7573,"Something worried me. “Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting?”  “He wants her to see his house,” she explained. “And your house is right next door.”",0
7574,"“Oh!”  “I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night,” went on Jordan, “but she never did. Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately suggested a luncheon in New York—and I thought he’d go mad:  “ ‘I don’t want to do anything out of the way!’",0
7575,"he kept saying. ‘I want to see her right next door.’ “When I said you were a particular friend of Tom’s, he started to abandon the whole idea. He doesn’t know very much about Tom, though he says he’s read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisy’s name.”",0
7576,"It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around Jordan’s golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner. Suddenly I wasn’t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more, but of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universal scepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and the tired.”",0
7577,"“And Daisy ought to have something in her life,” murmured Jordan to me. “Does she want to see Gatsby?”  “She’s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn’t want her to know. You’re just supposed to invite her to tea.”",0
7578,"We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the façade of Fifty-Ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park. Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled, and so I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.",0
7579,"V When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire. Two o’clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner, I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar.",0
7580,"At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into “hide-and-go-seek” or “sardines-in-the-box” with all the house thrown open to the game. But there wasn’t a sound. Only wind in the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.",0
7581,"“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said. “Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently. “I have been glancing into some of the rooms. Let’s go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.”  “It’s too late.”  “Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool?",0
7582,I haven’t made use of it all summer.” “I’ve got to go to bed.” “All right.”,0
7583,"He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness. “I talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment. “I’m going to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.”",0
7584,"“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly. “I don’t want to put you to any trouble.” “What day would suit you?”  “What day would suit you?”",0
7585,"he corrected me quickly. “I don’t want to put you to any trouble, you see.” “How about the day after tomorrow?”  He considered for a moment.",0
7586,"Then, with reluctance: “I want to get the grass cut,” he said. We both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that he meant my grass.",0
7587,"“There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated. “Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I asked.",0
7588,"“Oh, it isn’t about that. At least—” He fumbled with a series of beginnings. “Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don’t make much money, do you?”  “Not very much.”",0
7589,"This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently. “I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And I thought that if you don’t make very much—You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, old sport?”  “Trying to.”",0
7590,"“Well, this would interest you. It wouldn’t take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing.”",0
7591,"I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off there. “I’ve got my hands full,” I said. “I’m much obliged but I couldn’t take on any more work.”  “You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.”",0
7592,"Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the “gonnegtion” mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I’d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home. The evening had made me lightheaded and happy; I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door. So I don’t know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he “glanced into rooms” while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the office next morning, and invited her to come to tea.",0
7593,"“Don’t bring Tom,” I warned her. “What?”  “Don’t bring Tom.” “Who is ‘Tom’?” she asked innocently.",0
7594,"The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o’clock a man in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers.",0
7595,"The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in. He was pale, and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.",0
7596,"“Is everything all right?” he asked immediately. “The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.”  “What grass?”",0
7597,"he inquired blankly. “Oh, the grass in the yard.” He looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don’t believe he saw a thing.",0
7598,"“Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely. “One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was The Journal. Have you got everything you need in the shape of—of tea?”  I took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn.",0
7599,Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop. “Will they do?” I asked.,0
7600,"“Of course, of course! They’re fine!” and he added hollowly, “… old sport.”",0
7601,"The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay’s Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor, and peering towards the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me, in an uncertain voice, that he was going home.",0
7602,“Why’s that?”  “Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late!” He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. “I can’t wait all day.”  “Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four.”,0
7603,"He sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped up, and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard. Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up the drive. It stopped. Daisy’s face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile.",0
7604,"“Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?” The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone, before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.",0
7605,"“Are you in love with me,” she said low in my ear, “or why did I have to come alone?”  “That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour.”  “Come back in an hour, Ferdie.” Then in a grave murmur: “His name is Ferdie.”",0
7606,"“Does the gasoline affect his nose?”  “I don’t think so,” she said innocently. “Why?”  We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.",0
7607,"“Well, that’s funny,” I exclaimed. “What’s funny?”  She turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes.",0
7608,"With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into the living-room. It wasn’t a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.",0
7609,"For half a minute there wasn’t a sound. Then from the living-room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note:  “I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.” A pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall, so I went into the room.",0
7610,"Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom. His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy, who was sitting, frightened but graceful, on the edge of a stiff chair. “We’ve met before,” muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at me, and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and set it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand.",0
7611,"“I’m sorry about the clock,” he said. My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn’t muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.",0
7612,"“It’s an old clock,” I told them idiotically. I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor. “We haven’t met for many years,” said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be.",0
7613,“Five years next November.” The automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back at least another minute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray.,0
7614,"Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and, while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn’t an end in itself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to my feet.",0
7615,“Where are you going?” demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm. “I’ll be back.” “I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go.”,0
7616,"He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and whispered: “Oh, God!” in a miserable way. “What’s the matter?”  “This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his head from side to side, “a terrible, terrible mistake.”",0
7617,"“You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,” and luckily I added: “Daisy’s embarrassed too.”  “She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously. “Just as much as you are.”  “Don’t talk so loud.” “You’re acting like a little boy,” I broke out impatiently. “Not only that, but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all alone.”",0
7618,"He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable reproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other room. I walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain. Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby’s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the “period” craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to pay five years’ taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate decline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door. Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.",0
7619,"After half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer’s automobile rounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material for his servants’ dinner—I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from the large central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little now and then with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within the house too.",0
7620,"I went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound. They were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone. Daisy’s face was smeared with tears, and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.",0
7621,"“Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t seen me for years. I thought for a moment he was going to shake hands. “It’s stopped raining.”  “Has it?”",0
7622,"When he realized what I was talking about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy. “What do you think of that? It’s stopped raining.”",0
7623,"“I’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy. “I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,” he said, “I’d like to show her around.”",0
7624,"“You’re sure you want me to come?”  “Absolutely, old sport.” Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with humiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn. “My house looks well, doesn’t it?” he demanded. “See how the whole front of it catches the light.”",0
7625,"I agreed that it was splendid. “Yes.” His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. “It took me just three years to earn the money that bought it.”",0
7626,"“I thought you inherited your money.” “I did, old sport,” he said automatically, “but I lost most of it in the big panic—the panic of the war.” I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what business he was in he answered: “That’s my affair,” before he realized that it wasn’t an appropriate reply.",0
7627,"“Oh, I’ve been in several things,” he corrected himself. “I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business. But I’m not in either one now.” He looked at me with more attention. “Do you mean you’ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?”  Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.",0
7628,"“That huge place there?” she cried pointing. “Do you like it?”  “I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone.”",0
7629,"“I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people.”",0
7630,"Instead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the road and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees.",0
7631,"And inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and Restoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton College Library” I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter. We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It was Mr. Klipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby’s own apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam’s study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.",0
7632,"He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs.",0
7633,"His bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush with delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh. “It’s the funniest thing, old sport,” he said hilariously. “I can’t—When I try to—”  He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third.",0
7634,"After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an over-wound clock.",0
7635,"Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high. “I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.”",0
7636,"He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-coloured disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.",0
7637,"“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such beautiful shirts before.” After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the hydroplane, and the midsummer flowers—but outside Gatsby’s window it began to rain again, so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound.",0
7638,"“If it wasn’t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,” said Gatsby. “You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock.” Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.",0
7639,"I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk. “Who’s this?”  “That?",0
7640,"That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.” The name sounded faintly familiar. “He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.”",0
7641,"There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently when he was about eighteen. “I adore it,” exclaimed Daisy. “The pompadour! You never told me you had a pompadour—or a yacht.”  “Look at this,” said Gatsby quickly.",0
7642,"“Here’s a lot of clippings—about you.” They stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.",0
7643,"“Yes… Well, I can’t talk now… I can’t talk now, old sport… I said a small town… He must know what a small town is… Well, he’s no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town…”  He rang off. “Come here quick!” cried Daisy at the window.",0
7644,"The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea. “Look at that,” she whispered, and then after a moment: “I’d like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.” I tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone.",0
7645,"“I know what we’ll do,” said Gatsby, “we’ll have Klipspringer play the piano.” He went out of the room calling “Ewing!” and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now decently clothed in a “sport shirt,” open at the neck, sneakers, and duck trousers of a nebulous hue.",0
7646,"“Did we interrupt your exercise?” inquired Daisy politely. “I was asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment. “That is, I’d been asleep. Then I got up…”  “Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby, cutting him off.",0
7647,"“Don’t you, Ewing, old sport?”  “I don’t play well. I don’t—hardly play at all. I’m all out of prac—”  “We’ll go downstairs,” interrupted Gatsby.",0
7648,"He flipped a switch. The grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light. In the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.",0
7649,"When Klipspringer had played “The Love Nest” he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom. “I’m all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn’t play. I’m all out of prac—”  “Don’t talk so much, old sport,” commanded Gatsby.",0
7650,"“Play!”  “In the morning, In the evening, Ain’t we got fun—”  Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on the air.",0
7651,"“One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer The rich get richer and the poor get—children. In the meantime, In between time—”  As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.",0
7652,"As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn’t be over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song.",0
7653,"They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didn’t know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together.",0
7654,VI About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsby’s door and asked him if he had anything to say. “Anything to say about what?” inquired Gatsby politely. “Why—any statement to give out.”,0
7655,"It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard Gatsby’s name around his office in a connection which he either wouldn’t reveal or didn’t fully understand. This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out “to see.” It was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s instinct was right. Gatsby’s notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities upon his past, had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news. Contemporary legends such as the “underground pipeline to Canada” attached themselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy to say.",0
7656,"James Gatz—that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his career—when he saw Dan Cody’s yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the Tuolomee, and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour.",0
7657,"I suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time, even then. His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people—his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that—and he must be about His Father’s business, the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.",0
7658,"For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of Lake Superior as a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing days. He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted.",0
7659,"But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy’s wing.",0
7660,"An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf’s in southern Minnesota. He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s work with which he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.",0
7661,"Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money. The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgid journalism in 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny in Little Girl Bay.",0
7662,"To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. I suppose he smiled at Cody—he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick and extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a yachting cap. And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast, Gatsby left too.",0
7663,"He was employed in a vague personal capacity—while he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about, and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five years, during which the boat went three times around the Continent. It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.",0
7664,"I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s bedroom, a grey, florid man with a hard, empty face—the pioneer debauchee, who during one phase of American life brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone.",0
7665,"And it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars. He didn’t get it. He never understood the legal device that was used against him, but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man.",0
7666,"He told me all this very much later, but I’ve put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents, which weren’t even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away.",0
7667,"It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For several weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon. I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened before.",0
7668,"They were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously. “I’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby, standing on his porch. “I’m delighted that you dropped in.”",0
7669,"As though they cared!  “Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.” He walked around the room quickly, ringing bells. “I’ll have something to drink for you in just a minute.”",0
7670,"He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all, thanks… I’m sorry—  “Did you have a nice ride?”  “Very good roads around here.”",0
7671,"“I suppose the automobiles—”  “Yeah.”  Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had accepted the introduction as a stranger. “I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.” “Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering. “So we did. I remember very well.”  “About two weeks ago.”",0
7672,"“That’s right. You were with Nick here.” “I know your wife,” continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.",0
7673,"“That so?”  Tom turned to me. “You live near here, Nick?”  “Next door.” “That so?”  Mr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation, but lounged back haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—until unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.",0
7674,"“We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,” she suggested. “What do you say?”  “Certainly; I’d be delighted to have you.”  “Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. “Well—think ought to be starting home.”",0
7675,"“Please don’t hurry,” Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now, and he wanted to see more of Tom. “Why don’t you—why don’t you stay for supper? I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York.”",0
7676,"“You come to supper with me,” said the lady enthusiastically. “Both of you.” This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.",0
7677,"“Come along,” he said—but to her only. “I mean it,” she insisted. “I’d love to have you. Lots of room.”",0
7678,"Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn’t see that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t. “I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.",0
7679,"“Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating on Gatsby. Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear. “We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted aloud.",0
7680,"“I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby. “I used to ride in the army, but I’ve never bought a horse. I’ll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me for just a minute.”",0
7681,"The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside. “My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom. “Doesn’t he know she doesn’t want him?”  “She says she does want him.”",0
7682,"“She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.” He frowned. “I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”",0
7683,"Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses. “Come on,” said Mr. Sloane to Tom, “we’re late. We’ve got to go.” And then to me: “Tell him we couldn’t wait, will you?”",0
7684,"Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the front door. Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties that summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.",0
7685,"They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat. “These things excite me so,” she whispered. “If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card. I’m giving out green—”  “Look around,” suggested Gatsby.",0
7686,“I’m looking around. I’m having a marvellous—”  “You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about.” Tom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.,0
7687,"“We don’t go around very much,” he said; “in fact, I was just thinking I don’t know a soul here.” “Perhaps you know that lady.” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree. Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.",0
7688,"“She’s lovely,” said Daisy. “The man bending over her is her director.” He took them ceremoniously from group to group:  “Mrs. Buchanan… and Mr. Buchanan—” After an instant’s hesitation he added: “the polo player.”",0
7689,"“Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me.” But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained “the polo player” for the rest of the evening. “I’ve never met so many celebrities,” Daisy exclaimed. “I liked that man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose.”",0
7690,"Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer. “Well, I liked him anyhow.” “I’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said Tom pleasantly, “I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.”  Daisy and Gatsby danced.",0
7691,"I remember being surprised by his graceful, conservative foxtrot—I had never seen him dance before. Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour, while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden. “In case there’s a fire or a flood,” she explained, “or any act of God.”",0
7692,"Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together. “Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?” he said. “A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff.”  “Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and if you want to take down any addresses here’s my little gold pencil.”",0
7693,"… She looked around after a moment and told me the girl was “common but pretty,” and I knew that except for the half-hour she’d been alone with Gatsby she wasn’t having a good time. We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault—Gatsby had been called to the phone, and I’d enjoyed these same people only two weeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now.",0
7694,"“How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?” The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my shoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.",0
7695,"“Wha’?” A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence: “ Oh, she’s all right now. When she’s had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone.”",0
7696,"“I do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hollowly. “We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody that needs your help, Doc.’ ”  “She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, without gratitude, “but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.” “Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,” mumbled Miss Baedeker. “They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.”",0
7697,"“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered Doctor Civet. “Speak for yourself!” cried Miss Baedeker violently. “Your hand shakes. I wouldn’t let you operate on me!”",0
7698,"It was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star. They were still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek.",0
7699,"“I like her,” said Daisy, “I think she’s lovely.” But the rest offended her—and inarguably because it wasn’t a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented “place” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village—appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a shortcut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand.",0
7700,"I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass.",0
7701,“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly. “Some big bootlegger?”  “Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.,0
7702,"“I didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers, you know.”  “Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.",0
7703,"He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet. “Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together.”",0
7704,"A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar. “At least they are more interesting than the people we know,” she said with an effort. “You didn’t look so interested.”",0
7705,"“Well, I was.” Tom laughed and turned to me. “Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower?”  Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again.",0
7706,"When the melody rose her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air. “Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she said suddenly. “That girl hadn’t been invited. They simply force their way in and he’s too polite to object.”  “I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom.",0
7707,"“And I think I’ll make a point of finding out.” “I can tell you right now,” she answered. “He owned some drugstores, a lot of drugstores. He built them up himself.”",0
7708,"The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive. “Good night, Nick,” said Daisy. Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where “Three O’Clock in the Morning,” a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours? Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.",0
7709,"I stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free, and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead. When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired.",0
7710,"“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately. “Of course she did.” “She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “She didn’t have a good time.”",0
7711,"He was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression. “I feel far away from her,” he said. “It’s hard to make her understand.”",0
7712,"“You mean about the dance?”  “The dance?” He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers. “Old sport, the dance is unimportant.”",0
7713,"He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: “I never loved you.” After she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were five years ago.",0
7714,"“And she doesn’t understand,” he said. “She used to be able to understand. We’d sit for hours—”  He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers.",0
7715,"“I wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured. “You can’t repeat the past.”  “Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously. “Why of course you can!”",0
7716,"He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand. “I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,” he said, nodding determinedly. “She’ll see.”",0
7717,"He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was…  … One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.",0
7718,"His heart beat faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.",0
7719,"Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever.",0
7720,"VII It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night—and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over. Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.",0
7721,"“Is Mr. Gatsby sick?”  “Nope.” After a pause he added “sir” in a dilatory, grudging way. “I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came over.”  “Who?” he demanded rudely.",0
7722,"“Carraway.”  “Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.” Abruptly he slammed the door.",0
7723,"My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was that the new people weren’t servants at all. Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.",0
7724,"“Going away?” I inquired. “No, old sport.”",0
7725,“I hear you fired all your servants.” “I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy comes over quite often—in the afternoons.”,0
7726,So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes. “They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for. They’re all brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.”,0
7727,“I see.” He was calling up at Daisy’s request—would I come to lunch at her house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming. Something was up. And yet I couldn’t believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene—especially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.,0
7728,"The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her pocketbook slapped to the floor.",0
7729,"“Oh, my!” she gasped. I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it at arm’s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no designs upon it—but everyone near by, including the woman, suspected me just the same.",0
7730,“Hot!” said the conductor to familiar faces. “Some weather!… Hot!… Hot!… Hot!… Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it… ?”,0
7731,"My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand. That anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart! … Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door.",0
7732,"“The master’s body?” roared the butler into the mouthpiece. “I’m sorry, madame, but we can’t furnish it—it’s far too hot to touch this noon!” What he really said was: “Yes… Yes… I’ll see.”",0
7733,"He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take our stiff straw hats. “Madame expects you in the salon!” he cried, needlessly indicating the direction. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life.",0
7734,"The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans. “We can’t move,” they said together.",0
7735,"Jordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine. “And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?” I inquired.",0
7736,"Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone. Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.",0
7737,"“The rumour is,” whispered Jordan, “that that’s Tom’s girl on the telephone.” We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: “Very well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all… I’m under no obligations to you at all… and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I won’t stand that at all!”",0
7738,"“Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically. “No, he’s not,” I assured her. “It’s a bona-fide deal. I happen to know about it.”",0
7739,"Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room. “Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike. “I’m glad to see you, sir… Nick…”  “Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.",0
7740,"As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth. “You know I love you,” she murmured. “You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.",0
7741,"Daisy looked around doubtfully. “You kiss Nick too.” “What a low, vulgar girl!”  “I don’t care!”",0
7742,"cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace. Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room. “Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out her arms. “Come to your own mother that loves you.”",0
7743,"The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother’s dress. “The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and say—How-de-do.”",0
7744,Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand. Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don’t think he had ever really believed in its existence before.,0
7745,"“I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy. “That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.” Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck. “You dream, you. You absolute little dream.”",0
7746,"“Yes,” admitted the child calmly. “Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress too.” “How do you like mother’s friends?” Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby. “Do you think they’re pretty?”  “Where’s Daddy?”  “She doesn’t look like her father,” explained Daisy.",0
7747,“She looks like me. She’s got my hair and shape of the face.” Daisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand.,0
7748,"“Come, Pammy.”  “Goodbye, sweetheart!”  With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice. Gatsby took up his drink. “They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible tension.",0
7749,"We drank in long, greedy swallows. “I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,” said Tom genially. “It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into the sun—or wait a minute—it’s just the opposite—the sun’s getting colder every year.",0
7750,"“Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d like you to have a look at the place.” I went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.",0
7751,“I’m right across from you.” “So you are.” Our eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog-days alongshore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.,0
7752,"“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding. “I’d like to be out there with him for about an hour.” We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale.",0
7753,"“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the day after that, and the next thirty years?”  “Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. “Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.” “But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “and everything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!”",0
7754,"Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its senselessness into forms. “I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.”  “Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby’s eyes floated toward her. “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”",0
7755,"Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table. “You always look so cool,” she repeated.",0
7756,"She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was astounded. His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew a long time ago.",0
7757,"“You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently. “You know the advertisement of the man—”  “All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to town. Come on—we’re all going to town.”",0
7758,"He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one moved. “Come on!” His temper cracked a little. “What’s the matter, anyhow? If we’re going to town, let’s start.”",0
7759,"His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive. “Are we just going to go?” she objected. “Like this? Aren’t we going to let anyone smoke a cigarette first?”  “Everybody smoked all through lunch.”",0
7760,"“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him. “It’s too hot to fuss.” He didn’t answer.",0
7761,"“Have it your own way,” she said. “Come on, Jordan.” They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.",0
7762,“Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby with an effort. “About a quarter of a mile down the road.” “Oh.”  A pause.,0
7763,"“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely. “Women get these notions in their heads—”  “Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window. “I’ll get some whisky,” answered Tom. He went inside.",0
7764,"Gatsby turned to me rigidly:  “I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.” “She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of—” I hesitated.",0
7765,"“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly. That was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it… High in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl…  Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms.",0
7766,"“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green leather of the seat. “I ought to have left it in the shade.”  “Is it standard shift?”",0
7767,"demanded Tom. “Yes.”  “Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town. ”",0
7768,"The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby. “I don’t think there’s much gas,” he objected. “Plenty of gas,” said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge. “And if it runs out I can stop at a drugstore. You can buy anything at a drugstore nowadays.”",0
7769,"A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom frowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words, passed over Gatsby’s face. “Come on, Daisy” said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby’s car. “I’ll take you in this circus wagon.”",0
7770,"He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm. “You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow you in the coupé.”",0
7771,"She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby’s car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive heat, leaving them out of sight behind.",0
7772,"“Did you see that?” demanded Tom.  “See what?”  He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all along. “You think I’m pretty dumb, don’t you?” he suggested. “Perhaps I am, but I have a—almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do. Maybe you don’t believe that, but science—”  He paused.",0
7773,"The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from the edge of theoretical abyss. “I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,” he continued. “I could have gone deeper if I’d known—”  “Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?” inquired Jordan humorously.",0
7774,"“What?” Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. “A medium?”  “About Gatsby.”  “About Gatsby! No, I haven’t. I said I’d been making a small investigation of his past.”",0
7775,"“And you found he was an Oxford man,” said Jordan helpfully. “An Oxford man!” He was incredulous. “Like hell he is! He wears a pink suit.”",0
7776,"“Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man.”  “Oxford, New Mexico,” snorted Tom contemptuously, “or something like that.” “Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?” demanded Jordan crossly.",0
7777,"“Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married—God knows where!” We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s faded eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby’s caution about gasoline.",0
7778,"“We’ve got enough to get us to town,” said Tom. “But there’s a garage right here,” objected Jordan. “I don’t want to get stalled in this baking heat.”",0
7779,"Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilson’s sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car. “Let’s have some gas!” cried Tom roughly. “What do you think we stopped for—to admire the view?”  “I’m sick,” said Wilson without moving.",0
7780,"“Been sick all day.”  “What’s the matter?”  “I’m all run down.” “Well, shall I help myself?” Tom demanded. “You sounded well enough on the phone.”",0
7781,"With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face was green. “I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said. “But I need money pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car.”",0
7782,"“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom. “I bought it last week.” “It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.",0
7783,"“Like to buy it?”  “Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly. “No, but I could make some money on the other.” “What do you want money for, all of a sudden?”  “I’ve been here too long.",0
7784,"I want to get away. My wife and I want to go West.” “Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.",0
7785,"“She’s been talking about it for ten years.” He rested for a moment against the pump, shading his eyes. “And now she’s going whether she wants to or not. I’m going to get her away.”",0
7786,"The coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand. “What do I owe you?” demanded Tom harshly. “I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarked Wilson. “That’s why I want to get away. That’s why I been bothering you about the car.”",0
7787,"“What do I owe you?”  “Dollar twenty.” The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’t alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor girl with child.",0
7788,"“I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom. “I’ll send it over tomorrow afternoon.” That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind. Over the ash-heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away.",0
7789,"In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar—it was an expression I had often seen on women’s faces, but on Myrtle Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.",0
7790,"There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easygoing blue coupé.",0
7791,"“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,” suggested Jordan. “I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone’s away. There’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”",0
7792,"The word “sensuous” had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop, and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside. “Where are we going?” she cried.",0
7793,"“How about the movies?”  “It’s so hot,” she complained. “You go. We’ll ride around and meet you after.” With an effort her wit rose faintly. “We’ll meet you on some corner. I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.”",0
7794,"“We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us. “You follow me to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza.” Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of his life forever.",0
7795,"But they didn’t. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel. The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as “a place to have a mint julep.” Each of us said over and over that it was a “crazy idea”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny…  The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four o’clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park.",0
7796,"Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair. “It’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyone laughed. “Open another window,” commanded Daisy, without turning around.",0
7797,"“There aren’t any more.” “Well, we’d better telephone for an axe—”  “The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said Tom impatiently. “You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.”",0
7798,"He unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the table. “Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked Gatsby. “You’re the one that wanted to come to town.”",0
7799,"There was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse me”—but this time no one laughed. “I’ll pick it up,” I offered.",0
7800,"“I’ve got it.” Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered “Hum!” in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.",0
7801,"“That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said Tom sharply. “What is?”  “All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick that up?”  “Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “if you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute.",0
7802,Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.” As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding March from the ballroom below. “Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!” cried Jordan dismally.,0
7803,"“Still—I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered. “Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?”  “Biloxi,” he answered shortly.",0
7804,"“A man named Biloxi. ‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s a fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”  “They carried him into my house,” appended Jordan, “because we lived just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.” After a moment she added. “There wasn’t any connection.”",0
7805,"“I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked. “That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left. He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.”",0
7806,"The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of “Yea—ea—ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began. “We’re getting old,” said Daisy. “If we were young we’d rise and dance.”  “Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her.",0
7807,"“Where’d you know him, Tom?”  “Biloxi?” He concentrated with an effort. “I didn’t know him. He was a friend of Daisy’s.”",0
7808,"“He was not,” she denied. “I’d never seen him before. He came down in the private car.”",0
7809,"“Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.”  Jordan smiled.",0
7810,“He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class at Yale.” Tom and I looked at each other blankly.,0
7811,"“Biloxi?”  “First place, we didn’t have any president—”  Gatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly. “By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.” “Not exactly.”",0
7812,"“Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.” “Yes—I went there.” A pause. Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting:  “You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.”",0
7813,Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closing of the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.,0
7814,"“I told you I went there,” said Gatsby. “I heard you, but I’d like to know when.” “It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That’s why I can’t really call myself an Oxford man.”",0
7815,"Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all looking at Gatsby. “It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the armistice,” he continued. “We could go to any of the universities in England or France.”",0
7816,"I wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before. Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.",0
7817,"“Open the whisky, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep. Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself… Look at the mint!” “Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.”",0
7818,"“Go on,” Gatsby said politely. “What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?”  They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content. “He isn’t causing a row,” Daisy looked desperately from one to the other. “You’re causing a row. Please have a little self-control.”  “Self-control!”",0
7819,"repeated Tom incredulously. “I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out… Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white.”",0
7820,"Flushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization. “We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan. “I know I’m not very popular. I don’t give big parties. I suppose you’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends—in the modern world.”",0
7821,"Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete. “I’ve got something to tell you, old sport—” began Gatsby. But Daisy guessed at his intention.",0
7822,"“Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly. “Please let’s all go home. Why don’t we all go home?”  “That’s a good idea,” I got up.",0
7823,"“Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.” “I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.”",0
7824,"“Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby. “She’s never loved you. She loves me.”",0
7825,"“You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically. Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.",0
7826,"“She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried. “She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!”",0
7827,"At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions. “Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note. “What’s been going on? I want to hear all about it.”",0
7828,"“I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby. “Going on for five years—and you didn’t know.”  Tom turned to Daisy sharply. “You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”  “Not seeing,” said Gatsby.",0
7829,"“No, we couldn’t meet. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know. I used to laugh sometimes”—but there was no laughter in his eyes—“to think that you didn’t know.”",0
7830,"“Oh—that’s all.” Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair. “You’re crazy!” he exploded. “I can’t speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then—and I’ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now.”",0
7831,"“No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head. “She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He nodded sagely. “And what’s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.”  “You’re revolting,” said Daisy.",0
7832,"She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do you know why we left Chicago? I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you to the story of that little spree.” Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.",0
7833,"“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly. “It doesn’t matter any more. Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it’s all wiped out forever.”",0
7834,"She looked at him blindly. “Why—how could I love him—possibly?”  “You never loved him.” She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was doing—and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now. It was too late.",0
7835,"“I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance. “Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly. “No.”  From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air.",0
7836,"“Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?” There was a husky tenderness in his tone… “Daisy?”  “Please don’t.” Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it. She looked at Gatsby. “There, Jay,” she said—but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet.",0
7837,"“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby. “I love you now—isn’t that enough? I can’t help what’s past.” She began to sob helplessly. “I did love him once—but I loved you too.”",0
7838,"Gatsby’s eyes opened and closed. “You loved me too?” he repeated. “Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely. “She didn’t know you were alive. Why—there’s things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.”",0
7839,"The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby. “I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted. “She’s all excited now—”  “Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful voice.",0
7840,"“It wouldn’t be true.” “Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom. She turned to her husband.",0
7841,"“As if it mattered to you,” she said. “Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you from now on.”",0
7842,"“You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. “You’re not going to take care of her any more.” “I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to control himself now. “Why’s that?”  “Daisy’s leaving you.”  “Nonsense.”  “I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.",0
7843,“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby. “Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he put on her finger.”,0
7844,"“I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’s get out.”",0
7845,"“Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom. “You’re one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know. I’ve made a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry it further tomorrow.”",0
7846,"“You can suit yourself about that, old sport,” said Gatsby steadily. “I found out what your ‘drugstores’ were.” He turned to us and spoke rapidly. “He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That’s one of his little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn’t far wrong.”  “What about it?” said Gatsby politely.",0
7847,"“I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.” “And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of you.”",0
7848,"“He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport.”  “Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing. “Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.”",0
7849,"That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face. “That drugstore business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly, “but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me about.” I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to Gatsby—and was startled at his expression. He looked—and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had “killed a man.” For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way.",0
7850,"It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room. The voice begged again to go.",0
7851,"“Please, Tom! I can’t stand this any more.” Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage she had had, were definitely gone.",0
7852,"“You two start on home, Daisy,” said Tom. “In Mr. Gatsby’s car.” She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous scorn.",0
7853,“Go on. He won’t annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over.”,0
7854,"They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity. After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of whisky in the towel. “Want any of this stuff? Jordan?… Nick?”  I didn’t answer.",0
7855,“Nick?” He asked again. “What?”  “Want any?”  “No… I just remembered that today’s my birthday.”,0
7856,"I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a new decade. It was seven o’clock when we got into the coupé with him and started for Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy has its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind. Thirty—the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning briefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat’s shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.",0
7857,"So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight. The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage, and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if he did. While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead.",0
7858,"“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly. “She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we’re going to move away.” Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road. When anyone spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colourless way. He was his wife’s man and not his own.",0
7859,"So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn’t. He supposed he forgot to, that’s all. When he came outside again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.",0
7860,"“Beat me!” he heard her cry. “Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!”",0
7861,"A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over. The “death car” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then disappeared around the next bend. Mavro Michaelis wasn’t even sure of its colour—he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust.",0
7862,"Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long. We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away.",0
7863,“Wreck!” said Tom. “That’s good. Wilson’ll have a little business at last.”,0
7864,"He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes. “We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.” I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” uttered over and over in a gasping moan.",0
7865,"“There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly. He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.",0
7866,"The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it was a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals deranged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside. Myrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another blanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on a worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk back to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high, horrible call:",0
7867,"“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!”  Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around the garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman.",0
7868,"“M-a-v—” the policeman was saying, “—o—”  “No, r—” corrected the man, “M-a-v-r-o—”  “Listen to me!” muttered Tom fiercely. “r—” said the policeman, “o—”  “g—”  “g—” He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.",0
7869,"“What you want, fella?”  “What happened?—that’s what I want to know.”  “Auto hit her. Ins’antly killed.”  “Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring. “She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car.”",0
7870,"“There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see?”  “Going where?” asked the policeman keenly. “One goin’ each way. Well, she”—his hand rose toward the blankets but stopped halfway and fell to his side—“she ran out there an’ the one comin’ from N’York knock right into her, goin’ thirty or forty miles an hour.”",0
7871,“What’s the name of this place here?” demanded the officer. “Hasn’t got any name.” A pale well-dressed negro stepped near.,0
7872,"“It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car. New.”  “See the accident?” asked the policeman.",0
7873,"“No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty. Going fifty, sixty.”  “Come here and let’s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his name.”",0
7874,"Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his grasping cries:  “You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was!” Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in front of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.",0
7875,"“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothing gruffness. Wilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright. “Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little. “I just got here a minute ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talking about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do you hear? I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”",0
7876,"Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes. “What’s all that?” he demanded.",0
7877,“I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson’s body. “He says he knows the car that did it… It was a yellow car.”,0
7878,"Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom. “And what colour’s your car?”  “It’s a blue car, a coupé.” “We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.",0
7879,"Someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and the policeman turned away. “Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct—”  Picking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair, and came back. “If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snapped authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table. As he passed close to me he whispered: “Let’s get out.”  Self-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.",0
7880,"Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down hard, and the coupé raced along through the night. In a little while I heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face. “The God damned coward!” he whimpered. “He didn’t even stop his car.”",0
7881,"The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines. “Daisy’s home,” he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly.",0
7882,"“I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There’s nothing we can do tonight.” A change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision. As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases.",0
7883,"“I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper—if you want any.” He opened the door. “Come in.”  “No, thanks.",0
7884,But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi. I’ll wait outside.” Jordan put her hand on my arm.,0
7885,"“Won’t you come in, Nick?”  “No, thanks.” I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered for a moment more.",0
7886,"“It’s only half-past nine,” she said. I’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day, and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s voice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house, intending to wait by the gate.",0
7887,"I hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon. “What are you doing?” I inquired.",0
7888,"“Just standing here, old sport.” Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to see sinister faces, the faces of “Wolfshiem’s people,” behind him in the dark shrubbery.",0
7889,“Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked after a minute. “Yes.”  He hesitated.,0
7890,“Was she killed?”  “Yes.”  “I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It’s better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.”,0
7891,"He spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered. “I got to West Egg by a side road,” he went on, “and left the car in my garage. I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course I can’t be sure.”",0
7892,"I disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to tell him he was wrong. “Who was the woman?” he inquired. “Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen?”  “Well, I tried to swing the wheel—” He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.",0
7893,"“Was Daisy driving?”  “Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her instantly.”",0
7894,"“It ripped her open—”  “Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced. “Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.",0
7895,"“She’ll be all right tomorrow,” he said presently. “I’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”",0
7896,"“He won’t touch her,” I said. “He’s not thinking about her.” “I don’t trust him, old sport.”",0
7897,"“How long are you going to wait?”  “All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.” A new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it—he might think anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the ground floor.",0
7898,"“You wait here,” I said. “I’ll see if there’s any sign of a commotion.” I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.",0
7899,"Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table, with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of ale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.",0
7900,"They weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together. As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive.",0
7901,"“Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously. “Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated. “You’d better come home and get some sleep.”",0
7902,"He shook his head. “I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.”",0
7903,"He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight—watching over nothing. VIII I couldn’t sleep all night; a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage, frightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby’s drive, and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress—I felt that I had something to tell him, something to warn him about, and morning would be too late.",0
7904,"Crossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep. “Nothing happened,” he said wanly. “I waited, and about four o’clock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light.”",0
7905,"His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switches—once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though they hadn’t been aired for many days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table, with two stale, dry cigarettes inside. Throwing open the French windows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking out into the darkness.",0
7906,"“You ought to go away,” I said. “It’s pretty certain they’ll trace your car.”  “Go away now, old sport?”  “Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.” He wouldn’t consider it. He couldn’t possibly leave Daisy until he knew what she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and I couldn’t bear to shake him free.",0
7907,"It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody—told it to me because “Jay Gatsby” had broken up like glass against Tom’s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played out. I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy. She was the first “nice” girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly desirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him—he had never been in such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless intensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.",0
7908,"But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand.",0
7909,"He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretences. I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herself—that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of fact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world.",0
7910,"But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be. She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing. He felt married to her, that was all.",0
7911,"When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.",0
7912,"“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she didn’t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her… Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn’t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?”  On the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time.",0
7913,"It was a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.",0
7914,"He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns. After the armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now—there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters. She didn’t see why he couldn’t come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.",0
7915,"For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the “Beale Street Blues” while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.",0
7916,"Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at hand.",0
7917,"That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position, and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford.",0
7918,"It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning, gold-turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.",0
7919,"“I don’t think she ever loved him.” Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly. “You must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that frightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.”",0
7920,"He sat down gloomily. “Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were first married—and loved me more even then, do you see?”  Suddenly he came out with a curious remark. “In any case,” he said, “it was just personal.”",0
7921,"What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn’t be measured? He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy’s house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty.",0
7922,"He left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found her—that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach—he was penniless now—was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.",0
7923,"The track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.",0
7924,"It was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavour in the air. The gardener, the last one of Gatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the steps.",0
7925,"“I’m going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves’ll start falling pretty soon, and then there’s always trouble with the pipes.”  “Don’t do it today,” Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically. “You know, old sport, I’ve never used that pool all summer?”  I looked at my watch and stood up.",0
7926,"“Twelve minutes to my train.” I didn’t want to go to the city. I wasn’t worth a decent stroke of work, but it was more than that—I didn’t want to leave Gatsby. I missed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away.",0
7927,"“I’ll call you up,” I said finally. “Do, old sport.” “I’ll call you about noon.”",0
7928,"We walked slowly down the steps. “I suppose Daisy’ll call too.” He looked at me anxiously, as if he hoped I’d corroborate this.",0
7929,"“I suppose so.” “Well, goodbye.” We shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I remembered something and turned around.",0
7930,"“They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the lawn. “You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together.” I’ve always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time. His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of colour against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home, three months before. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption—and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.",0
7931,"I thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for that—I and the others. “Goodbye,” I called. “I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.”",0
7932,"Up in the city, I tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair. Just before noon the phone woke me, and I started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool, as if a divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at the office window, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.",0
7933,"“I’ve left Daisy’s house,” she said. “I’m at Hempstead, and I’m going down to Southampton this afternoon.” Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy’s house, but the act annoyed me, and her next remark made me rigid.",0
7934,“You weren’t so nice to me last night.” “How could it have mattered then?”  Silence for a moment. Then:  “However—I want to see you.”,0
7935,"“I want to see you, too.”  “Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?”  “No—I don’t think this afternoon.” “Very well.”  “It’s impossible this afternoon. Various—”  We talked like that for a while, and then abruptly we weren’t talking any longer.",0
7936,"I don’t know which of us hung up with a sharp click, but I know I didn’t care. I couldn’t have talked to her across a tea-table that day if I never talked to her again in this world. I called Gatsby’s house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. I tried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was being kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my timetable, I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I leaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.",0
7937,"When I passed the ash-heaps on the train that morning I had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car. I supposed there’d be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust, and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened, until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic achievement was forgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at the garage after we left there the night before.",0
7938,"They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must have broken her rule against drinking that night, for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of this, she immediately fainted, as if that was the intolerable part of the affair. Someone, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sister’s body.",0
7939,"Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside. For a while the door of the office was open, and everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it. Finally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door. Michaelis and several other men were with him; first, four or five men, later two or three men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer, while he went back to his own place and made a pot of coffee. After that, he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn.",0
7940,"About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering changed—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen. But when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry “Oh, my God!” again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him.",0
7941,"“How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit still a minute, and answer my question. How long have you been married?”  “Twelve years.”",0
7942,"“Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still—I asked you a question. Did you ever have any children?”  The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before.",0
7943,"He didn’t like to go into the garage, because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortably around the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet. “Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you haven’t been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?”  “Don’t belong to any.”",0
7944,"“You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have gone to church once. Didn’t you get married in a church? Listen, George, listen to me. Didn’t you get married in a church?”  “That was a long time ago.”",0
7945,"The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking—for a moment he was silent. Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back into his faded eyes. “Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing at the desk.",0
7946,"“Which drawer?”  “That drawer—that one.”  Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided silver. It was apparently new.",0
7947,"“This?” he inquired, holding it up. Wilson stared and nodded. “I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but I knew it was something funny.”",0
7948,"“You mean your wife bought it?”  “She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.” Michaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash. But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began saying “Oh, my God!” again in a whisper—his comforter left several explanations in the air.",0
7949,"“Then he killed her,” said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly. “Who did?”  “I have a way of finding out.”",0
7950,"“You’re morbid, George,” said his friend. “This has been a strain to you and you don’t know what you’re saying. You’d better try and sit quiet till morning.”",0
7951,"“He murdered her.” “It was an accident, George.” Wilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior “Hm!”  “I know,” he said definitely.",0
7952,"“I’m one of these trusting fellas and I don’t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know it. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he wouldn’t stop.”",0
7953,"Michaelis had seen this too, but it hadn’t occurred to him that there was any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any particular car. “How could she of been like that?”  “She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that answered the question.",0
7954,"“Ah-h-h—”  He began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand. “Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?”  This was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend: there was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn wasn’t far off. About five o’clock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light.",0
7955,"Wilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ash-heaps, where small grey clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind. “I spoke to her,” he muttered, after a long silence. “I told her she might fool me but she couldn’t fool God. I took her to the window”—with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against it—“and I said ‘God knows what you’ve been doing, everything you’ve been doing. You may fool me, but you can’t fool God!’ ”  Standing behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and enormous, from the dissolving night.",0
7956,"“God sees everything,” repeated Wilson. “That’s an advertisement,” Michaelis assured him. Something made him turn away from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.",0
7957,"By six o’clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which he and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now, and Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.",0
7958,"His movements—he was on foot all the time—were afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich that he didn’t eat, and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and walking slowly, for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon. Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who had seen a man “acting sort of crazy,” and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared from view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he “had a way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car. On the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the way to Gatsby’s house. So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.",0
7959,"At two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to pump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be taken out under any circumstances—and this was strange, because the front right fender needed repair.",0
7960,"Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees. No telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep and waited for it until four o’clock—until long after there was anyone to give it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t believe it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about… like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees.",0
7961,"The chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s protégés—heard the shots—afterwards he could only say that he hadn’t thought anything much about them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed anyone. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I hurried down to the pool.",0
7962,"There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the water.",0
7963,"It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete. IX After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of Gatsby’s front door. A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning.",0
7964,"Most of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial, eager, and untrue. When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might have said anything, didn’t say a word. She showed a surprising amount of character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man “deranged by grief” in order that the case might remain in its simplest form. And it rested there.",0
7965,"But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on Gatsby’s side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.",0
7966,"I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them. “Left no address?”  “No.”  “Say when they’d be back?”  “No.”  “Any idea where they are?",0
7967,"How I could reach them?”  “I don’t know. Can’t say.” I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where he lay and reassure him: “I’ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don’t worry. Just trust me and I’ll get somebody for you—”  Meyer Wolfshiem’s name wasn’t in the phone book.",0
7968,"The butler gave me his office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the time I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the phone. “Will you ring again?”  “I’ve rung three times.” “It’s very important.”",0
7969,"“Sorry. I’m afraid no one’s there.” I went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with shocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:  “Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me.",0
7970,"You’ve got to try hard. I can’t go through this alone.” Someone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he’d never told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence, staring down from the wall.",0
7971,"Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem, which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure he’d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there’d be a wire from Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all.",0
7972,Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out.,0
7973,"Yours truly  Meyer Wolfshiem  and then hasty addenda beneath:  Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all. When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came through as a man’s voice, very thin and far away.",0
7974,"“This is Slagle speaking…”  “Yes?” The name was unfamiliar. “Hell of a note, isn’t it? Get my wire?”  “There haven’t been any wires.”",0
7975,"“Young Parke’s in trouble,” he said rapidly. “They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York giving ’em the numbers just five minutes before. What d’you know about that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns—”  “Hello!”",0
7976,I interrupted breathlessly. “Look here—this isn’t Mr. Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby’s dead.”,0
7977,"There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an exclamation… then a quick squawk as the connection was broken. I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.",0
7978,"It was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man, very helpless and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His eyes leaked continuously with excitement, and when I took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on the point of collapse, so I took him into the music-room and made him sit down while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn’t eat, and the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.",0
7979,"“I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,” he said. “It was all in the Chicago newspaper. I started right away.”",0
7980,"“I didn’t know how to reach you.” His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room. “It was a madman,” he said. “He must have been mad.”  “Wouldn’t you like some coffee?”",0
7981,"I urged him. “I don’t want anything. I’m all right now, Mr.—”  “Carraway.”",0
7982,"“Well, I’m all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?”  I took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there. Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall; when I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly away.",0
7983,"After a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the first time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been deferred until he came.",0
7984,"“I didn’t know what you’d want, Mr. Gatsby—”  “Gatz is my name.” “—Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body West.”",0
7985,"He shook his head. “Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in the East. Were you a friend of my boy’s, Mr.—?”  “We were close friends.”",0
7986,"“He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man, but he had a lot of brain power here.” He touched his head impressively, and I nodded.",0
7987,"“If he’d of lived, he’d of been a great man. A man like James J. Hill. He’d of helped build up the country.”  “That’s true,” I said, uncomfortably.",0
7988,"He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed, and lay down stiffly—was instantly asleep. That night an obviously frightened person called up, and demanded to know who I was before he would give his name. “This is Mr. Carraway,” I said.",0
7989,“Oh!” He sounded relieved. “This is Klipspringer.”,0
7990,"I was relieved too, for that seemed to promise another friend at Gatsby’s grave. I didn’t want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd, so I’d been calling up a few people myself. They were hard to find.",0
7991,"“The funeral’s tomorrow,” I said. “Three o’clock, here at the house. I wish you’d tell anybody who’d be interested.”",0
7992,"“Oh, I will,” he broke out hastily. “Of course I’m not likely to see anybody, but if I do.” His tone made me suspicious.",0
7993,"“Of course you’ll be there yourself.” “Well, I’ll certainly try. What I called up about is—”  “Wait a minute,” I interrupted.",0
7994,"“How about saying you’ll come?”  “Well, the fact is—the truth of the matter is that I’m staying with some people up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect me to be with them tomorrow. In fact, there’s a sort of picnic or something. Of course I’ll do my best to get away.”",0
7995,"I ejaculated an unrestrained “Huh!” and he must have heard me, for he went on nervously:  “What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if it’d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You see, they’re tennis shoes, and I’m sort of helpless without them. My address is care of B. F.—”  I didn’t hear the rest of the name, because I hung up the receiver.",0
7996,"After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby—one gentleman to whom I telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was my fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby’s liquor, and I should have known better than to call him. The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfshiem; I couldn’t seem to reach him any other way. The door that I pushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked “The Swastika Holding Company,” and at first there didn’t seem to be anyone inside. But when I’d shouted “hello” several times in vain, an argument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes.",0
7997,"“Nobody’s in,” she said. “Mr. Wolfshiem’s gone to Chicago.” The first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to whistle “The Rosary,” tunelessly, inside.",0
7998,"“Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.” “I can’t get him back from Chicago, can I?” At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem’s, called “Stella!” from the other side of the door.",0
7999,"“Leave your name on the desk,” she said quickly. “I’ll give it to him when he gets back.” “But I know he’s there.”",0
8000,"She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips. “You young men think you can force your way in here any time,” she scolded. “We’re getting sickantired of it. When I say he’s in Chicago, he’s in Chicago.”",0
8001,I mentioned Gatsby. “Oh-h!” She looked at me over again. “Will you just—What was your name?”  She vanished.,0
8002,"In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the doorway, holding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me a cigar. “My memory goes back to when first I met him,” he said. “A young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war. He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldn’t buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was when he came into Winebrenner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a job. He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days. ‘Come on have some lunch with me,’ I said. He ate more than four dollars’ worth of food in half an hour.”",0
8003,“Did you start him in business?” I inquired. “Start him! I made him.”,0
8004,"“Oh.”  “I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right away he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like that in everything”—he held up two bulbous fingers—“always together.”",0
8005,"I wondered if this partnership had included the World’s Series transaction in 1919. “Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment. “You were his closest friend, so I know you’ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.”  “I’d like to come.”",0
8006,"“Well, come then.” The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears. “I can’t do it—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he said.",0
8007,"“There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over now.” “When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way. I keep out. When I was a young man it was different—if a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think that’s sentimental, but I mean it—to the bitter end.”",0
8008,"I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come, so I stood up. “Are you a college man?” he inquired suddenly.",0
8009,"For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a “gonnegtion,” but he only nodded and shook my hand. “Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead,” he suggested. “After that my own rule is to let everything alone.”",0
8010,When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg in a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found Mr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his son and in his son’s possessions was continually increasing and now he had something to show me.,0
8011,“Jimmy sent me this picture.” He took out his wallet with trembling fingers. “Look there.”,0
8012,"It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty with many hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. “Look there!” and then sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself.",0
8013,“Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very pretty picture. It shows up well.”,0
8014,"“Very well. Had you seen him lately?”  “He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in now. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home, but I see now there was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of him. And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.”",0
8015,"He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong Cassidy. “Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows you.”",0
8016,"He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see. On the last flyleaf was printed the word schedule, and the date September 12, 1906. And underneath:  Rise from bed	6:00	a.m. Dumbell exercise and wall-scaling	6:15⁠–⁠6:30	“ Study electricity, etc.	",0
8017,"7:15⁠–⁠8:15	“ Work	8:30⁠–⁠4:30	p.m. Baseball and sports	4:30⁠–⁠5:00	“ Practise elocution, poise and how to attain it	5:00⁠–⁠6:00	“ Study needed inventions	7:00⁠–⁠9:00	“ General Resolves No wasting time at Shafters or [a name, indecipherable]  No more smokeing or chewing. Bath every other day  Read one improving book or magazine per week  Save $5.00 [crossed out] $3.00 per week  Be better to parents  “I came across this book by accident,” said the old man.",0
8018,"“It just shows you, don’t it?”  “It just shows you.” “Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this or something. Do you notice what he’s got about improving his mind? He was always great for that. He told me I et like a hog once, and I beat him for it.”",0
8019,"He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own use. A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing, and I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did Gatsby’s father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously, and he spoke of the rain in a worried, uncertain way. The minister glanced several times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour. But it wasn’t any use. Nobody came.",0
8020,"About five o’clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate—first a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and me in the limousine, and a little later four or five servants and the postman from West Egg, in Gatsby’s station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I looked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby’s books in the library one night three months before.",0
8021,"I’d never seen him since then. I don’t know how he knew about the funeral, or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses, and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby’s grave.",0
8022,"I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already too far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy hadn’t sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur “Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,” and then the owl-eyed man said “Amen to that,” in a brave voice. We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-eyes spoke to me by the gate.",0
8023,"“I couldn’t get to the house,” he remarked. “Neither could anybody else.”  “Go on!” He started. “Why, my God! they used to go there by the hundreds.”",0
8024,"He took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in. “The poor son-of-a-bitch,” he said. One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school and later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a December evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into their own holiday gaieties, to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-That’s and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: “Are you going to the Ordways’? the Herseys’? the Schultzes’?” and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.",0
8025,"When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we melted indistinguishably into it again. That’s my Middle West—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family’s name. I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.",0
8026,"Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old—even then it had always for me a quality of distortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a house—the wrong house. But no one knows the woman’s name, and no one cares.",0
8027,"After Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home. There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together, and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big chair.",0
8028,"She was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the colour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that, though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’t making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye.",0
8029,"“Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jordan suddenly. “You threw me over on the telephone. I don’t give a damn about you now, but it was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.”",0
8030,"We shook hands. “Oh, and do you remember”—she added—“a conversation we had once about driving a car?”  “Why—not exactly.” “You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I? I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.”",0
8031,"“I’m thirty,” I said. “I’m five years too old to lie to myself and call it honour.” She didn’t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.",0
8032,"One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewellery store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back, holding out his hand.",0
8033,"“What’s the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?”  “Yes. You know what I think of you.”",0
8034,"“You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly. “Crazy as hell. I don’t know what’s the matter with you.”",0
8035,"“Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?”  He stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours. I started to turn away, but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm. “I told him the truth,” he said. “He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren’t in he tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn’t told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house—” He broke off defiantly. “What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy’s, but he was a tough one. He ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never even stopped his car.”",0
8036,"There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn’t true. “And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering—look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful—”  I couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified.",0
8037,"It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made…  I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewellery store to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.",0
8038,"Gatsby’s house was still empty when I left—the grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own. I didn’t want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train.",0
8039,"I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden, and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn’t investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn’t know that the party was over.",0
8040,"On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand.",0
8041,"Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.",0
8042,"And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.",0
8043,"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further… And one fine morning— So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.",0
8044,"Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton. Do not think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it meant a lot to Cohn. He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he disliked it, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton. There was a certain inner comfort in knowing he could knock down anybody who was snooty to him, although, being very shy and a thoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym. He was Spider Kelly’s star pupil. Spider Kelly taught all his young gentlemen to box like featherweights, no matter whether they weighed one hundred and five or two hundred and five pounds. But it seemed to fit Cohn. He was really very fast. He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and got his nose permanently flattened. This increased Cohn’s distaste for boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and it certainly improved his nose. In his last year at Princeton he read too much and took to wearing spectacles. I never met any one of his class who remembered him. They did not even remember that he was middleweight boxing champion.",0
8045,"I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together, and I always had a suspicion that perhaps Robert Cohn had never been middleweight boxing champion, and that perhaps a horse had stepped on his face, or that maybe his mother had been frightened or seen something, or that he had, maybe, bumped into something as a young child, but I finally had somebody verify the story from Spider Kelly. Spider Kelly not only remembered Cohn. He had often wondered what had become of him.",0
8046,"Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richest Jewish families in New York, and through his mother of one of the oldest. At the military school where he prepped for Princeton, and played a very good end on the football team, no one had made him race-conscious. No one had ever made him feel he was a Jew, and hence any different from anybody else, until he went to Princeton. He was a nice boy, a friendly boy, and very shy, and it made him bitter. He took it out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton with painful self-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the first girl who was nice to him. He was married five years, had three children, lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, the balance of the estate having gone to his mother, hardened into a rather unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife; and just when he had made up his mind to leave his wife she left him and went off with a miniature-painter. As he had been thinking for months about leaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to deprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock.",0
8047,"The divorce was arranged and Robert Cohn went out to the Coast. In California he fell among literary people and, as he still had a little of the fifty thousand left, in a short time he was backing a review of the Arts. The review commenced publication in Carmel, California, and finished in Provincetown, Massachusetts. By that time Cohn, who had been regarded purely as an angel, and whose name had appeared on the editorial page merely as a member of the advisory board, had become the sole editor. It was his money and he discovered he liked the authority of editing. He was sorry when the magazine became too expensive and he had to give it up.",0
8048,"By that time, though, he had other things to worry about. He had been taken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine. She was very forceful, and Cohn never had a chance of not being taken in hand. Also he was sure that he loved her. When this lady saw that the magazine was not going to rise, she became a little disgusted with Cohn and decided that she might as well get what there was to get while there was still something available, so she urged that they go to Europe, where Cohn could write. They came to Europe, where the lady had been educated, and stayed three years. During these three years, the first spent in travel, the last two in Paris, Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks and myself. Braddocks was his literary friend. I was his tennis friend.",0
8049,"The lady who had him, her name was Frances, found toward the end of the second year that her looks were going, and her attitude toward Robert changed from one of careless possession and exploitation to the absolute determination that he should marry her. During this time Robert’s mother had settled an allowance on him, about three hundred dollars a month. During two years and a half I do not believe that Robert Cohn looked at another woman. He was fairly happy, except that, like many people living in Europe, he would rather have been in America, and he had discovered writing. He wrote a novel, and it was not really such a bad novel as the critics later called it, although it was a very poor novel. He read many books, played bridge, played tennis, and boxed at a local gymnasium.",0
8050,"I first became aware of his lady’s attitude toward him one night after the three of us had dined together. We had dined at l’Avenue’s and afterward went to the Café de Versailles for coffee. We had several fines after the coffee, and I said I must be going. Cohn had been talking about the two of us going off somewhere on a weekend trip. He wanted to get out of town and get in a good walk. I suggested we fly to Strasbourg and walk up to Saint Odile, or somewhere or other in Alsace. “I know a girl in Strasbourg who can show us the town,” I said.",0
8051,Somebody kicked me under the table. I thought it was accidental and went on: “She’s been there two years and knows everything there is to know about the town. She’s a swell girl.”,0
8052,"I was kicked again under the table and, looking, saw Frances, Robert’s lady, her chin lifting and her face hardening. “Hell,” I said, “why go to Strasbourg? We could go up to Bruges, or to the Ardennes.”",0
8053,"Cohn looked relieved. I was not kicked again. I said good-night and went out. Cohn said he wanted to buy a paper and would walk to the corner with me. “For God’s sake,” he said, “why did you say that about that girl in Strasbourg for? Didn’t you see Frances?”  “No, why should I?",0
8054,"If I know an American girl that lives in Strasbourg what the hell is it to Frances?”  “It doesn’t make any difference. Any girl. I couldn’t go, that would be all.”  “Don’t be silly.”",0
8055,"“You don’t know Frances. Any girl at all. Didn’t you see the way she looked?”  “Oh, well,” I said, “let’s go to Senlis.”  “Don’t get sore.”",0
8056,"“I’m not sore. Senlis is a good place and we can stay at the Grand Cerf and take a hike in the woods and come home.”  “Good, that will be fine.” “Well, I’ll see you to-morrow at the courts,” I said.",0
8057,"“Good-night, Jake,” he said, and started back to the café. “You forgot to get your paper,” I said. “That’s so.” He walked with me up to the kiosque at the corner. “You are not sore, are you, Jake?” He turned with the paper in his hand.",0
8058,"“No, why should I be?”  “See you at tennis,” he said. I watched him walk back to the café holding his paper. I rather liked him and evidently she led him quite a life.",0
8059,"CHAPTER 2 That winter Robert Cohn went over to America with his novel, and it was accepted by a fairly good publisher. His going made an awful row I heard, and I think that was where Frances lost him, because several women were nice to him in New York, and when he came back he was quite changed. He was more enthusiastic about America than ever, and he was not so simple, and he was not so nice. The publishers had praised his novel pretty highly and it rather went to his head. Then several women had put themselves out to be nice to him, and his horizons had all shifted. For four years his horizon had been absolutely limited to his wife. For three years, or almost three years, he had never seen beyond Frances. I am sure he had never been in love in his life.",0
8060,"He had married on the rebound from the rotten time he had in college, and Frances took him on the rebound from his discovery that he had not been everything to his first wife. He was not in love yet but he realized that he was an attractive quantity to women, and that the fact of a woman caring for him and wanting to live with him was not simply a divine miracle. This changed him so that he was not so pleasant to have around. Also, playing for higher stakes than he could afford in some rather steep bridge games with his New York connections, he had held cards and won several hundred dollars. It made him rather vain of his bridge game, and he talked several times of how a man could always make a living at bridge if he were ever forced to.",0
8061,"Then there was another thing. He had been reading W. H. Hudson. That sounds like an innocent occupation, but Cohn had read and reread “The Purple Land.” “The Purple Land” is a very sinister book if read too late in life. It recounts splendid imaginary amorous adventures of a perfect English gentleman in an intensely romantic land, the scenery of which is very well described. For a man to take it at thirty-four as a guide-book to what life holds is about as safe as it would be for a man of the same age to enter Wall Street direct from a French convent, equipped with a complete set of the more practical Alger books. Cohn, I believe, took every word of “The Purple Land” as literally as though it had been an R. G. Dun report. You understand me, he made some reservations, but on the whole the book to him was sound. It was all that was needed to set him off. I did not realize the extent to which it had set him off until one day he came into my office.",0
8062,"“Hello, Robert,” I said. “Did you come in to cheer me up?”  “Would you like to go to South America, Jake?” he asked. “No.”  “Why not?”  “I don’t know.",0
8063,I never wanted to go. Too expensive. You can see all the South Americans you want in Paris anyway.”,0
8064,"“They’re not the real South Americans.” “They look awfully real to me.” I had a boat train to catch with a week’s mail stories, and only half of them written.",0
8065,"“Do you know any dirt?” I asked. “No.”  “None of your exalted connections getting divorces?”  “No; listen, Jake.",0
8066,"If I handled both our expenses, would you go to South America with me?”  “Why me?”  “You can talk Spanish. And it would be more fun with two of us.” “No,” I said, “I like this town and I go to Spain in the summer-time.”",0
8067,"“All my life I’ve wanted to go on a trip like that,” Cohn said. He sat down. “I’ll be too old before I can ever do it.”  “Don’t be a fool,” I said.",0
8068,"“You can go anywhere you want. You’ve got plenty of money.” “I know. But I can’t get started.”  “Cheer up,” I said.",0
8069,“All countries look just like the moving pictures.” But I felt sorry for him. He had it badly.,0
8070,“I can’t stand it to think my life is going so fast and I’m not really living it.” “Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bull-fighters.” “I’m not interested in bull-fighters. That’s an abnormal life. I want to go back in the country in South America. We could have a great trip.”,0
8071,"“Did you ever think about going to British East Africa to shoot?”  “No, I wouldn’t like that.” “I’d go there with you.” “No; that doesn’t interest me.”",0
8072,“That’s because you never read a book about it. Go on and read a book all full of love affairs with the beautiful shiny black princesses.” “I want to go to South America.”,0
8073,"He had a hard, Jewish, stubborn streak. “Come on down-stairs and have a drink.”  “Aren’t you working?”  “No,” I said. We went down the stairs to the café on the ground floor. I had discovered that was the best way to get rid of friends. Once you had a drink all you had to say was: “Well, I’ve got to get back and get off some cables,” and it was done. It is very important to discover graceful exits like that in the newspaper business, where it is such an important part of the ethics that you should never seem to be working. Anyway, we went down-stairs to the bar and had a whiskey and soda. Cohn looked at the bottles in bins around the wall. “This is a good place,” he said.",0
8074,"“There’s a lot of liquor,” I agreed. “Listen, Jake,” he leaned forward on the bar. “Don’t you ever get the feeling that all your life is going by and you’re not taking advantage of it? Do you realize you’ve lived nearly half the time you have to live already?”  “Yes, every once in a while.”",0
8075,"“Do you know that in about thirty-five years more we’ll be dead?”  “What the hell, Robert,” I said. “What the hell.”  “I’m serious.” “It’s one thing I don’t worry about,” I said.",0
8076,"“You ought to.”  “I’ve had plenty to worry about one time or other. I’m through worrying.” “Well, I want to go to South America.”  “Listen, Robert, going to another country doesn’t make any difference.",0
8077,I’ve tried all that. You can’t get away from yourself by moving from one place to another. There’s nothing to that.”,0
8078,"“But you’ve never been to South America.”  “South America hell! If you went there the way you feel now it would be exactly the same. This is a good town. Why don’t you start living your life in Paris?”  “I’m sick of Paris, and I’m sick of the Quarter.”  “Stay away from the Quarter.",0
8079,Cruise around by yourself and see what happens to you.” “Nothing happens to me. I walked alone all one night and nothing happened except a bicycle cop stopped me and asked to see my papers.”  “Wasn’t the town nice at night?”  “I don’t care for Paris.”,0
8080,"So there you were. I was sorry for him, but it was not a thing you could do anything about, because right away you ran up against the two stubbornnesses: South America could fix it and he did not like Paris. He got the first idea out of a book, and I suppose the second came out of a book too.",0
8081,"“Well,” I said, “I’ve got to go up-stairs and get off some cables.” “Do you really have to go?”  “Yes, I’ve got to get these cables off.” “Do you mind if I come up and sit around the office?”  “No, come on up.”",0
8082,"He sat in the outer room and read the papers, and the Editor and Publisher and I worked hard for two hours. Then I sorted out the carbons, stamped on a by-line, put the stuff in a couple of big manila envelopes and rang for a boy to take them to the Gare St. Lazare. I went out into the other room and there was Robert Cohn asleep in the big chair. He was asleep with his head on his arms. I did not like to wake him up, but I wanted to lock the office and shove off. I put my hand on his shoulder. He shook his head. “I can’t do it,” he said, and put his head deeper into his arms. “I can’t do it. Nothing will make me do it.”",0
8083,"“Robert,” I said, and shook him by the shoulder. He looked up. He smiled and blinked.",0
8084,"“Did I talk out loud just then?”  “Something. But it wasn’t clear.” “God, what a rotten dream!”  “Did the typewriter put you to sleep?”  “Guess so.",0
8085,"I didn’t sleep all last night.” “What was the matter?”  “Talking,” he said. I could picture it. I have a rotten habit of picturing the bedroom scenes of my friends. We went out to the Café Napolitain to have an apéritif and watch the evening crowd on the Boulevard.",0
8086,"CHAPTER 3 It was a warm spring night and I sat at a table on the terrace of the Napolitain after Robert had gone, watching it get dark and the electric signs come on, and the red and green stop-and-go traffic-signal, and the crowd going by, and the horse-cabs clippety-clopping along at the edge of the solid taxi traffic, and the poules going by, singly and in pairs, looking for the evening meal. I watched a good-looking girl walk past the table and watched her go up the street and lost sight of her, and watched another, and then saw the first one coming back again. She went by once more and I caught her eye, and she came over and sat down at the table. The waiter came up.",0
8087,"“Well, what will you drink?” I asked. “Pernod.”  “That’s not good for little girls.”",0
8088,"“Little girl yourself. Dites garçon, un pernod.”  “A pernod for me, too.”  “What’s the matter?” she asked. “Going on a party?”  “Sure. Aren’t you?”  “I don’t know.",0
8089,"You never know in this town.”  “Don’t you like Paris?”  “No.”  “Why don’t you go somewhere else?”  “Isn’t anywhere else.” “You’re happy, all right.” “Happy, hell!”  Pernod is greenish imitation absinthe.",0
8090,"When you add water it turns milky. It tastes like licorice and it has a good uplift, but it drops you just as far. We sat and drank it, and the girl looked sullen.",0
8091,"“Well,” I said, “are you going to buy me a dinner?”  She grinned and I saw why she made a point of not laughing. With her mouth closed she was a rather pretty girl. I paid for the saucers and we walked out to the street. I hailed a horse-cab and the driver pulled up at the curb. Settled back in the slow, smoothly rolling fiacre we moved up the Avenue de l’Opéra, passed the locked doors of the shops, their windows lighted, the Avenue broad and shiny and almost deserted. The cab passed the New York Herald bureau with the window full of clocks.",0
8092,“What are all the clocks for?” she asked. “They show the hour all over America.”  “Don’t kid me.”,0
8093,"We turned off the Avenue up the Rue des Pyramides, through the traffic of the Rue de Rivoli, and through a dark gate into the Tuileries. She cuddled against me and I put my arm around her. She looked up to be kissed. She touched me with one hand and I put her hand away.",0
8094,“Never mind.” “What’s the matter? You sick?”  “Yes.”  “Everybody’s sick.,0
8095,"I’m sick, too.” We came out of the Tuileries into the light and crossed the Seine and then turned up the Rue des Saints Pères. “You oughtn’t to drink pernod if you’re sick.”",0
8096,“You neither.”  “It doesn’t make any difference with me. It doesn’t make any difference with a woman.” “What are you called?”  “Georgette.,0
8097,"How are you called?”  “Jacob.” “That’s a Flemish name.”  “American too.” “You’re not Flamand?”  “No, American.”  “Good, I detest Flamands.”",0
8098,By this time we were at the restaurant. I called to the cocher to stop. We got out and Georgette did not like the looks of the place. “This is no great thing of a restaurant.”,0
8099,"“No,” I said. “Maybe you would rather go to Foyot’s. Why don’t you keep the cab and go on?”  I had picked her up because of a vague sentimental idea that it would be nice to eat with some one.",0
8100,"It was a long time since I had dined with a poule, and I had forgotten how dull it could be. We went into the restaurant, passed Madame Lavigne at the desk and into a little room. Georgette cheered up a little under the food.",0
8101,"“It isn’t bad here,” she said. “It isn’t chic, but the food is all right.”  “Better than you eat in Liège.” “Brussels, you mean.”",0
8102,"We had another bottle of wine and Georgette made a joke. She smiled and showed all her bad teeth, and we touched glasses. “You’re not a bad type,” she said. “It’s a shame you’re sick. We get on well. What’s the matter with you, anyway?”  “I got hurt in the war,” I said.",0
8103,"“Oh, that dirty war.” We would probably have gone on and discussed the war and agreed that it was in reality a calamity for civilization, and perhaps would have been better avoided. I was bored enough. Just then from the other room some one called: “Barnes! I say, Barnes! Jacob Barnes!”  “It’s a friend calling me,” I explained, and went out.",0
8104,"There was Braddocks at a big table with a party: Cohn, Frances Clyne, Mrs. Braddocks, several people I did not know. “You’re coming to the dance, aren’t you?” Braddocks asked.",0
8105,"“What dance?”  “Why, the dancings. Don’t you know we’ve revived them?” Mrs. Braddocks put in.",0
8106,"“You must come, Jake. We’re all going,” Frances said from the end of the table. She was tall and had a smile.",0
8107,"“Of course, he’s coming,” Braddocks said. “Come in and have coffee with us, Barnes.” “Right.”  “And bring your friend,” said Mrs. Braddocks laughing.",0
8108,"She was a Canadian and had all their easy social graces. “Thanks, we’ll be in,” I said. I went back to the small room.",0
8109,“Who are your friends?” Georgette asked. “Writers and artists.”,0
8110,"“There are lots of those on this side of the river.” “Too many.” “I think so. Still, some of them make money.”",0
8111,"“Oh, yes.” We finished the meal and the wine. “Come on,” I said. “We’re going to have coffee with the others.”",0
8112,"Georgette opened her bag, made a few passes at her face as she looked in the little mirror, re-defined her lips with the lipstick, and straightened her hat. “Good,” she said. We went into the room full of people and Braddocks and the men at his table stood up.",0
8113,"“I wish to present my fiancée, Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc,” I said. Georgette smiled that wonderful smile, and we shook hands all round. “Are you related to Georgette Leblanc, the singer?” Mrs. Braddocks asked.",0
8114,"“Connais pas,” Georgette answered. “But you have the same name,” Mrs. Braddocks insisted cordially. “No,” said Georgette. “Not at all. My name is Hobin.”",0
8115,"“But Mr. Barnes introduced you as Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc. Surely he did,” insisted Mrs. Braddocks, who in the excitement of talking French was liable to have no idea what she was saying. “He’s a fool,” Georgette said.",0
8116,"“Oh, it was a joke, then,” Mrs. Braddocks said. “Yes,” said Georgette. “To laugh at.”  “Did you hear that, Henry?”",0
8117,"Mrs. Braddocks called down the table to Braddocks. “Mr. Barnes introduced his fiancée as Mademoiselle Leblanc, and her name is actually Hobin.”  “Of course, darling. Mademoiselle Hobin, I’ve known her for a very long time.”",0
8118,"“Oh, Mademoiselle Hobin,” Frances Clyne called, speaking French very rapidly and not seeming so proud and astonished as Mrs. Braddocks at its coming out really French. “Have you been in Paris long? Do you like it here? You love Paris, do you not?”  “Who’s she?”",0
8119,"Georgette turned to me. “Do I have to talk to her?”  She turned to Frances, sitting smiling, her hands folded, her head poised on her long neck, her lips pursed ready to start talking again. “No, I don’t like Paris. It’s expensive and dirty.”  “Really?",0
8120,I find it so extraordinarily clean. One of the cleanest cities in all Europe.”  “I find it dirty.”  “How strange! But perhaps you have not been here very long.”,0
8121,“I’ve been here long enough.” “But it does have nice people in it. One must grant that.”,0
8122,"Georgette turned to me. “You have nice friends.” Frances was a little drunk and would have liked to have kept it up but the coffee came, and Lavigne with the liqueurs, and after that we all went out and started for Braddocks’s dancing-club.",0
8123,"The dancing-club was a bal musette in the Rue de la Montagne Sainte Geneviève. Five nights a week the working people of the Pantheon quarter danced there. One night a week it was the dancing-club. On Monday nights it was closed. When we arrived it was quite empty, except for a policeman sitting near the door, the wife of the proprietor back of the zinc bar, and the proprietor himself. The daughter of the house came downstairs as we went in. There were long benches, and tables ran across the room, and at the far end a dancing-floor.",0
8124,"“I wish people would come earlier,” Braddocks said. The daughter came up and wanted to know what we would drink. The proprietor got up on a high stool beside the dancing-floor and began to play the accordion. He had a string of bells around one of his ankles and beat time with his foot as he played. Every one danced. It was hot and we came off the floor perspiring.",0
8125,"“My God,” Georgette said. “What a box to sweat in!” “It’s hot.”  “Hot, my God!”  “Take off your hat.”  “That’s a good idea.”",0
8126,"Some one asked Georgette to dance, and I went over to the bar. It was really very hot and the accordion music was pleasant in the hot night. I drank a beer, standing in the doorway and getting the cool breath of wind from the street. Two taxis were coming down the steep street. They both stopped in front of the Bal. A crowd of young men, some in jerseys and some in their shirt-sleeves, got out. I could see their hands and newly washed, wavy hair in the light from the door. The policeman standing by the door looked at me and smiled. They came in. As they went in, under the light I saw white hands, wavy hair, white faces, grimacing, gesturing, talking. With them was Brett. She looked very lovely and she was very much with them.",0
8127,"One of them saw Georgette and said: “I do declare. There is an actual harlot. I’m going to dance with her, Lett. You watch me.”",0
8128,"The tall dark one, called Lett, said: “Don’t you be rash.” The wavy blond one answered: “Don’t you worry, dear.” And with them was Brett.",0
8129,"I was very angry. Somehow they always made me angry. I know they are supposed to be amusing, and you should be tolerant, but I wanted to swing on one, any one, anything to shatter that superior, simpering composure. Instead, I walked down the street and had a beer at the bar at the next Bal. The beer was not good and I had a worse cognac to take the taste out of my mouth. When I came back to the Bal there was a crowd on the floor and Georgette was dancing with the tall blond youth, who danced big-hippily, carrying his head on one side, his eyes lifted as he danced. As soon as the music stopped another one of them asked her to dance. She had been taken up by them. I knew then that they would all dance with her. They are like that.",0
8130,"I sat down at a table. Cohn was sitting there. Frances was dancing. Mrs. Braddocks brought up somebody and introduced him as Robert Prentiss. He was from New York by way of Chicago, and was a rising new novelist. He had some sort of an English accent. I asked him to have a drink.",0
8131,"“Thanks so much,” he said, “I’ve just had one.”  “Have another.” “Thanks, I will then.” We got the daughter of the house over and each had a fine à l’eau.",0
8132,"“You’re from Kansas City, they tell me,” he said. “Yes.”  “Do you find Paris amusing?”  “Yes.”  “Really?”  I was a little drunk. Not drunk in any positive sense but just enough to be careless.",0
8133,"“For God’s sake,” I said, “yes. Don’t you?”  “Oh, how charmingly you get angry,” he said. “I wish I had that faculty.”",0
8134,"I got up and walked over toward the dancing-floor. Mrs. Braddocks followed me. “Don’t be cross with Robert,” she said. “He’s still only a child, you know.”",0
8135,"“I wasn’t cross,” I said. “I just thought perhaps I was going to throw up.” “Your fiancée is having a great success,” Mrs. Braddocks looked out on the floor where Georgette was dancing in the arms of the tall, dark one, called Lett.",0
8136,"“Isn’t she?” I said. “Rather,” said Mrs. Braddocks.",0
8137,"Cohn came up. “Come on, Jake,” he said, “have a drink.” We walked over to the bar. “What’s the matter with you? You seem all worked up over something?”  “Nothing.",0
8138,"This whole show makes me sick is all.” Brett came up to the bar. “Hello, you chaps.”  “Hello, Brett,” I said.",0
8139,"“Why aren’t you tight?”  “Never going to get tight any more. I say, give a chap a brandy and soda.” She stood holding the glass and I saw Robert Cohn looking at her. He looked a great deal as his compatriot must have looked when he saw the promised land. Cohn, of course, was much younger. But he had that look of eager, deserving expectation.",0
8140,"Brett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy’s. She started all that. She was built with curves like the hull of a racing yacht, and you missed none of it with that wool jersey.",0
8141,"“It’s a fine crowd you’re with, Brett,” I said. “Aren’t they lovely? And you, my dear. Where did you get it?”  “At the Napolitain.”",0
8142,"“And have you had a lovely evening?”  “Oh, priceless,” I said. Brett laughed. “It’s wrong of you, Jake. It’s an insult to all of us. Look at Frances there, and Jo.”",0
8143,"This for Cohn’s benefit. “It’s in restraint of trade,” Brett said. She laughed again.",0
8144,"“You’re wonderfully sober,” I said. “Yes. Aren’t I? And when one’s with the crowd I’m with, one can drink in such safety, too.”",0
8145,"The music started and Robert Cohn said: “Will you dance this with me, Lady Brett?”  Brett smiled at him. “I’ve promised to dance this with Jacob,” she laughed. “You’ve a hell of a biblical name, Jake.”  “How about the next?” asked Cohn.",0
8146,"“We’re going,” Brett said. “We’ve a date up at Montmartre.” Dancing, I looked over Brett’s shoulder and saw Cohn, standing at the bar, still watching her.",0
8147,"“You’ve made a new one there,” I said to her. “Don’t talk about it. Poor chap. I never knew it till just now.”",0
8148,"“Oh, well,” I said. “I suppose you like to add them up.”  “Don’t talk like a fool.” “You do.”",0
8149,"“Oh, well. What if I do?”  “Nothing,” I said. We were dancing to the accordion and some one was playing the banjo. It was hot and I felt happy. We passed close to Georgette dancing with another one of them.",0
8150,"“What possessed you to bring her?”  “I don’t know, I just brought her.” “You’re getting damned romantic.”  “No, bored.”  “Now?”  “No, not now.”  “Let’s get out of here. She’s well taken care of.”",0
8151,"“Do you want to?”  “Would I ask you if I didn’t want to?”  We left the floor and I took my coat off a hanger on the wall and put it on. Brett stood by the bar. Cohn was talking to her. I stopped at the bar and asked them for an envelope. The patronne found one. I took a fifty-franc note from my pocket, put it in the envelope, sealed it, and handed it to the patronne.",0
8152,"“If the girl I came with asks for me, will you give her this?” I said. “If she goes out with one of those gentlemen, will you save this for me?”  “C’est entendu, Monsieur,” the patronne said.",0
8153,"“You go now? So early?”  “Yes,” I said. We started out the door. Cohn was still talking to Brett. She said good night and took my arm. “Good night, Cohn,” I said. Outside in the street we looked for a taxi.",0
8154,"“You’re going to lose your fifty francs,” Brett said. “Oh, yes.”  “No taxis.” “We could walk up to the Pantheon and get one.”  “Come on and we’ll get a drink in the pub next door and send for one.”",0
8155,“You wouldn’t walk across the street.” “Not if I could help it.” We went into the next bar and I sent a waiter for a taxi.,0
8156,"“Well,” I said, “we’re out away from them.” We stood against the tall zinc bar and did not talk and looked at each other. The waiter came and said the taxi was outside. Brett pressed my hand hard. I gave the waiter a franc and we went out. “Where should I tell him?” I asked.",0
8157,"“Oh, tell him to drive around.” I told the driver to go to the Parc Montsouris, and got in, and slammed the door. Brett was leaning back in the corner, her eyes closed. I got in and sat beside her. The cab started with a jerk.",0
8158,"“Oh, darling, I’ve been so miserable,” Brett said. CHAPTER 4 The taxi went up the hill, passed the lighted square, then on into the dark, still climbing, then levelled out onto a dark street behind St. Etienne du Mont, went smoothly down the asphalt, passed the trees and the standing bus at the Place de la Contrescarpe, then turned onto the cobbles of the Rue Mouffetard. There were lighted bars and late open shops on each side of the street. We were sitting apart and we jolted close together going down the old street. Brett’s hat was off. Her head was back. I saw her face in the lights from the open shops, then it was dark, then I saw her face clearly as we came out on the Avenue des Gobelins. The street was torn up and men were working on the car-tracks by the light of acetylene flares. Brett’s face was white and the long line of her neck showed in the bright light of the flares. The street was dark again and I kissed her. Our lips were tight together and then she turned away and pressed against the corner of the seat, as far away as she could get. Her head was down.",0
8159,"“Don’t touch me,” she said. “Please don’t touch me.” “What’s the matter?”  “I can’t stand it.”",0
8160,"“Oh, Brett.”  “You mustn’t. You must know. I can’t stand it, that’s all. Oh, darling, please understand!”  “Don’t you love me?”  “Love you?",0
8161,"I simply turn all to jelly when you touch me.” “Isn’t there anything we can do about it?” She was sitting up now. My arm was around her and she was leaning back against me, and we were quite calm. She was looking into my eyes with that way she had of looking that made you wonder whether she really saw out of her own eyes. They would look on and on after every one else’s eyes in the world would have stopped looking. She looked as though there were nothing on earth she would not look at like that, and really she was afraid of so many things.",0
8162,"“And there’s not a damn thing we could do,” I said. “I don’t know,” she said. “I don’t want to go through that hell again.”",0
8163,"“We’d better keep away from each other.” “But, darling, I have to see you. It isn’t all that you know.”",0
8164,"“No, but it always gets to be.”  “That’s my fault. Don’t we pay for all the things we do, though?”  She had been looking into my eyes all the time. Her eyes had different depths, sometimes they seemed perfectly flat. Now you could see all the way into them.",0
8165,"“When I think of the hell I’ve put chaps through. I’m paying for it all now.”  “Don’t talk like a fool,” I said. “Besides, what happened to me is supposed to be funny. I never think about it.”",0
8166,"“Oh, no. I’ll lay you don’t.” “Well, let’s shut up about it.”",0
8167,"“I laughed about it too, myself, once.” She wasn’t looking at me. “A friend of my brother’s came home that way from Mons. It seemed like a hell of a joke. Chaps never know anything, do they?”  “No,” I said.",0
8168,"“Nobody ever knows anything.” I was pretty well through with the subject. At one time or another I had probably considered it from most of its various angles, including the one that certain injuries or imperfections are a subject of merriment while remaining quite serious for the person possessing them.",0
8169,"“It’s funny,” I said. “It’s very funny. And it’s a lot of fun, too, to be in love.”",0
8170,“Do you think so?” her eyes looked flat again. “I don’t mean fun that way. In a way it’s an enjoyable feeling.”,0
8171,"“No,” she said. “I think it’s hell on earth.” “It’s good to see each other.”",0
8172,“No. I don’t think it is.”  “Don’t you want to?”  “I have to.” We were sitting now like two strangers. On the right was the Parc Montsouris. The restaurant where they have the pool of live trout and where you can sit and look out over the park was closed and dark. The driver leaned his head around.,0
8173,“Where do you want to go?” I asked. Brett turned her head away.,0
8174,"“Oh, go to the Select.” “Café Select,” I told the driver. “Boulevard Montparnasse.” We drove straight down, turning around the Lion de Belfort that guards the passing Montrouge trams. Brett looked straight ahead. On the Boulevard Raspail, with the lights of Montparnasse in sight, Brett said: “Would you mind very much if I asked you to do something?”  “Don’t be silly.”  “Kiss me just once more before we get there.”",0
8175,"When the taxi stopped I got out and paid. Brett came out putting on her hat. She gave me her hand as she stepped down. Her hand was shaky. “I say, do I look too much of a mess?” She pulled her man’s felt hat down and started in for the bar. Inside, against the bar and at tables, were most of the crowd who a been at the dance.",0
8176,"“Hello, you chaps,” Brett said. “I’m going to have a drink.” “Oh, Brett! Brett!” the little Greek portrait-painter, who called himself a duke, and whom everybody called Zizi, pushed up to her. “I got something fine to tell you.”",0
8177,"“Hello, Zizi,” Brett said. “I want you to meet a friend,” Zizi said. A fat man came up.",0
8178,"“Count Mippipopolous, meet my friend Lady Ashley.” “How do you do?” said Brett. “Well, does your Ladyship have a good time here in Paris?” asked Count Mippipopolous, who wore an elk’s tooth on his watch-chain.",0
8179,"“Rather,” said Brett. “Paris is a fine town all right,” said the count. “But I guess you have pretty big doings yourself over in London.”",0
8180,"“Oh, yes,” said Brett. “Enormous.”  Braddocks called to me from a table. “Barnes,” he said, “have a drink. That girl of yours got in a frightful row.”",0
8181,"“What about?”  “Something the patronne’s daughter said. A corking row. She was rather splendid, you know. Showed her yellow card and demanded the patronne’s daughter’s too. I say it was a row.”  “What finally happened?”  “Oh, some one took her home.",0
8182,Not a bad-looking girl. Wonderful command of the idiom. Do stay and have a drink.”,0
8183,"“No,” I said. “I must shove off. Seen Cohn?”  “He went home with Frances,” Mrs. Braddock put in.",0
8184,"“Poor chap, he looks awfully down,” Braddocks said. “I dare say he is,” said Mrs. Braddocks. “I have to shove off,” I said. “Good night.”",0
8185,"I said good night to Brett at the bar. The count was buying champagne. “Will you take a glass of wine with us, sir?” he asked.",0
8186,“No. Thanks awfully. I have to go.”  “Really going?” Brett asked.,0
8187,"“Yes,” I said. “I’ve got a rotten headache.” “I’ll see you to-morrow?”  “Come in at the office.”  “Hardly.”",0
8188,"“Well, where will I see you?”  “Anywhere around five o’clock.” “Make it the other side of town then.” “Good. I’ll be at the Crillon at five.”  “Try and be there,” I said.",0
8189,"“Don’t worry,” Brett said. “I’ve never let you down, have I?”  “Heard from Mike?”  “Letter to-day.” “Good night, sir,” said the count.",0
8190,"I went out onto the sidewalk and walked down toward the Boulevard St. Michel, passed the tables of the Rotonde, still crowded, looked across the street at the Dome, its tables running out to the edge of the pavement. Some one waved at me from a table, I did not see who it was and went on. I wanted to get home. The Boulevard Montparnasse was deserted. Lavigne’s was closed tight, and they were stacking the tables outside the Closerie des Lilas. I passed Ney’s statue standing among the new-leaved chestnut-trees in the arc-light. There was a faded purple wreath leaning against the base. I stopped and read the inscription: from the Bonapartist Groups, some date; I forget. He looked very fine, Marshal Ney in his top-boots, gesturing with his sword among the green new horse-chestnut leaves. My flat was just across the street, a little way down the Boulevard St. Michel.",0
8191,"There was a light in the concierge’s room and I knocked on the door and she gave me my mail. I wished her good night and went up-stairs. There were two letters and some papers. I looked at them under the gas-light in the dining-room. The letters were from the States. One was a bank statement. It showed a balance of $2432.60. I got out my check-book and deducted four checks drawn since the first of the month, and discovered I had a balance of $1832.60. I wrote this on the back of the statement. The other letter was a wedding announcement. Mr. and Mrs. Aloysius Kirby announce the marriage of their daughter Katherine—I knew neither the girl nor the man she was marrying. They must be circularizing the town. It was a funny name. I felt sure I could remember anybody with a name like Aloysius. It was a good Catholic name. There was a crest on the announcement. Like Zizi the Greek duke. And that count. The count was funny. Brett had a title, too. Lady Ashley. To hell with Brett. To hell with you, Lady Ashley.",0
8192,"I lit the lamp beside the bed, turned off the gas, and opened the wide windows. The bed was far back from the windows, and I sat with the windows open and undressed by the bed. Outside a night train, running on the street-car tracks, went by carrying vegetables to the markets. They were noisy at night when you could not sleep. Undressing, I looked at myself in the mirror of the big armoire beside the bed. That was a typically French way to furnish a room. Practical, too, I suppose. Of all the ways to be wounded. I suppose it was funny. I put on my pajamas and got into bed. I had the two bull-fight papers, and I took their wrappers off. One was orange. The other yellow. They would both have the same news, so whichever I read first would spoil the other. Le Toril was the better paper, so I started to read it. I read it all the way through, including the Petite Correspondance and the Cornigrams. I blew out the lamp. Perhaps I would be able to sleep.",0
8193,"My head started to work. The old grievance. Well, it was a rotten way to be wounded and flying on a joke front like the Italian. In the Italian hospital we were going to form a society. It had a funny name in Italian. I wonder what became of the others, the Italians. That was in the Ospedale Maggiore in Milano, Padiglione Ponte. The next building was the Padiglione Zonda. There was a statue of Ponte, or maybe it was Zonda. That was where the liaison colonel came to visit me. That was funny. That was about the first funny thing. I was all bandaged up. But they had told him about it. Then he made that wonderful speech: “You, a foreigner, an Englishman” (any foreigner was an Englishman) “have given more than your life.” What a speech! I would like to have it illuminated to hang in the office. He never laughed. He was putting himself in my place, I guess. “Che mala fortuna! Che mala fortuna!”",0
8194,"I never used to realize it, I guess. I try and play it along and just not make trouble for people. Probably I never would have had any trouble if I hadn’t run into Brett when they shipped me to England. I suppose she only wanted what she couldn’t have. Well, people were that way. To hell with people. The Catholic Church had an awfully good way of handling all that. Good advice, anyway. Not to think about it. Oh, it was swell advice. Try and take it sometime. Try and take it.",0
8195,"I lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around. Then I couldn’t keep away from it, and I started to think about Brett and all the rest of it went away. I was thinking about Brett and my mind stopped jumping around and started to go in sort of smooth waves. Then all of a sudden I started to cry. Then after a while it was better and I lay in bed and listened to the heavy trams go by and way down the street, and then I went to sleep.",0
8196,I woke up. There was a row going on outside. I listened and I thought I recognized a voice. I put on a dressing-gown and went to the door. The concierge was talking down-stairs. She was very angry. I heard my name and called down the stairs.,0
8197,"“Is that you, Monsieur Barnes?” the concierge called. “Yes. It’s me.”",0
8198,“There’s a species of woman here who’s waked the whole street up. What kind of a dirty business at this time of night! She says she must see you. I’ve told her you’re asleep.”,0
8199,Then I heard Brett’s voice. Half asleep I had been sure it was Georgette. I don’t know why. She could not have known my address.,0
8200,"“Will you send her up, please?”  Brett came up the stairs. I saw she was quite drunk. “Silly thing to do,” she said. “Make an awful row. I say, you weren’t asleep, were you?”  “What did you think I was doing?”  “Don’t know.",0
8201,"What time is it?”  I looked at the clock. It was half-past four. “Had no idea what hour it was,” Brett said. “I say, can a chap sit down? Don’t be cross, darling. Just left the count. He brought me here.”",0
8202,"“What’s he like?” I was getting brandy and soda and glasses. “Just a little,” said Brett. “Don’t try and make me drunk. The count? Oh, rather. He’s quite one of us.”",0
8203,"“Is he a count?”  “Here’s how. I rather think so, you know. Deserves to be, anyhow. Knows hell’s own amount about people. Don’t know where he got it all. Owns a chain of sweetshops in the States.”",0
8204,"She sipped at her glass. “Think he called it a chain. Something like that. Linked them all up. Told me a little about it. Damned interesting. He’s one of us, though. Oh, quite. No doubt. One can always tell.”",0
8205,"She took another drink. “How do I buck on about all this? You don’t mind, do you? He’s putting up for Zizi, you know.”",0
8206,"“Is Zizi really a duke, too?”  “I shouldn’t wonder. Greek, you know. Rotten painter. I rather liked the count.”",0
8207,"“Where did you go with him?”  “Oh, everywhere. He just brought me here now. Offered me ten thousand dollars to go to Biarritz with him. How much is that in pounds?”  “Around two thousand.”  “Lot of money.",0
8208,I told him I couldn’t do it. He was awfully nice about it. Told him I knew too many people in Biarritz.”,0
8209,"Brett laughed. “I say, you are slow on the up-take,” she said. I had only sipped my brandy and soda. I took a long drink.",0
8210,"“That’s better. Very funny,” Brett said. “Then he wanted me to go to Cannes with him. Told him I knew too many people in Cannes. Monte Carlo. Told him I knew too many people in Monte Carlo. Told him I knew too many people everywhere. Quite true, too. So I asked him to bring me here.”",0
8211,"She looked at me, her hand on the table, her glass raised. “Don’t look like that,” she said. “Told him I was in love with you. True, too. Don’t look like that. He was damn nice about it. Wants to drive us out to dinner to-morrow night. Like to go?”  “Why not?”  “I’d better go now.”",0
8212,“Why?”  “Just wanted to see you. Damned silly idea. Want to get dressed and come down? He’s got the car just up the street.”,0
8213,"“The count?”  “Himself. And a chauffeur in livery. Going to drive me around and have breakfast in the Bois. Hampers. Got it all at Zelli’s. Dozen bottles of Mumms. Tempt you?”  “I have to work in the morning,” I said.",0
8214,“I’m too far behind you now to catch up and be any fun.”  “Don’t be an ass.”  “Can’t do it.” “Right. Send him a tender message?”  “Anything.,0
8215,"Absolutely.”  “Good night, darling.”  “Don’t be sentimental.” “You make me ill.” We kissed good night and Brett shivered. “I’d better go,” she said. “Good night, darling.”  “You don’t have to go.”",0
8216,"“Yes.”  We kissed again on the stairs and as I called for the cordon the concierge muttered something behind her door. I went back up-stairs and from the open window watched Brett walking up the street to the big limousine drawn up to the curb under the arc-light. She got in and it started off. I turned around. On the table was an empty glass and a glass half-full of brandy and soda. I took them both out to the kitchen and poured the half-full glass down the sink. I turned off the gas in the dining-room, kicked off my slippers sitting on the bed, and got into bed. This was Brett, that I had felt like crying about. Then I thought of her walking up the street and stepping into the car, as I had last seen her, and of course in a little while I felt like hell again. It is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at night it is another thing.",0
8217,"CHAPTER 5 In the morning I walked down the Boulevard to the rue Soufflot for coffee and brioche. It was a fine morning. The horse-chestnut trees in the Luxembourg gardens were in bloom. There was the pleasant early-morning feeling of a hot day. I read the papers with the coffee and then smoked a cigarette. The flower-women were coming up from the market and arranging their daily stock. Students went by going up to the law school, or down to the Sorbonne. The Boulevard was busy with trams and people going to work. I got on an S bus and rode down to the Madeleine, standing on the back platform. From the Madeleine I walked along the Boulevard des Capucines to the Opéra, and up to my office. I passed the man with the jumping frogs and the man with the boxer toys. I stepped aside to avoid walking into the thread with which his girl assistant manipulated the boxers. She was standing looking away, the thread in her folded hands. The man was urging two tourists to buy. Three more tourists had stopped and were watching. I walked on behind a man who was pushing a roller that printed the name CINZANO on the sidewalk in damp letters. All along people were going to work. It felt pleasant to be going to work. I walked across the avenue and turned in to my office.",0
8218,"Up-stairs in the office I read the French morning papers, smoked, and then sat at the typewriter and got off a good morning’s work. At eleven o’clock I went over to the Quai d’Orsay in a taxi and went in and sat with about a dozen correspondents, while the foreign-office mouthpiece, a young Nouvelle Revue Française diplomat in horn-rimmed spectacles, talked and answered questions for half an hour. The President of the Council was in Lyons making a speech, or, rather he was on his way back. Several people asked questions to hear themselves talk and there were a couple of questions asked by news service men who wanted to know the answers. There was no news. I shared a taxi back from the Quai d’Orsay with Woolsey and Krum.",0
8219,"“What do you do nights, Jake?” asked Krum. “I never see you around.” “Oh, I’m over in the Quarter.”",0
8220,"“I’m coming over some night. The Dingo. That’s the great place, isn’t it?”  “Yes.",0
8221,"That, or this new dive, The Select.”  “I’ve meant to get over,” said Krum. “You know how it is, though, with a wife and kids.” “Playing any tennis?” Woolsey asked.",0
8222,"“Well, no,” said Krum. “I can’t say I’ve played any this year. I’ve tried to get away, but Sundays it’s always rained, and the courts are so damned crowded.”",0
8223,"“The Englishmen all have Saturday off,” Woolsey said. “Lucky beggars,” said Krum. “Well, I’ll tell you. Some day I’m not going to be working for an agency. Then I’ll have plenty of time to get out in the country.”",0
8224,“That’s the thing to do. Live out in the country and have a little car.” “I’ve been thinking some about getting a car next year.”,0
8225,"I banged on the glass. The chauffeur stopped. “Here’s my street,” I said. “Come in and have a drink.”",0
8226,"“Thanks, old man,” Krum said. Woolsey shook his head. “I’ve got to file that line he got off this morning.”",0
8227,"I put a two-franc piece in Krum’s hand. “You’re crazy, Jake,” he said. “This is on me.”",0
8228,"“It’s all on the office, anyway.” “Nope. I want to get it.”",0
8229,I waved good-by. Krum put his head out. “See you at the lunch on Wednesday.”  “You bet.”,0
8230,"I went to the office in the elevator. Robert Cohn was waiting for me. “Hello, Jake,” he said. “Going out to lunch?”  “Yes.",0
8231,Let me see if there is anything new.” “Where will we eat?”  “Anywhere.” I was looking over my desk. “Where do you want to eat?”  “How about Wetzel’s?,0
8232,"They’ve got good hors d’œuvres.” In the restaurant we ordered hors d’œuvres and beer. The sommelier brought the beer, tall, beaded on the outside of the steins, and cold. There were a dozen different dishes of hors d’œuvres.",0
8233,“Have any fun last night?” I asked. “No. I don’t think so.”,0
8234,“How’s the writing going?”  “Rotten. I can’t get this second book going.” “That happens to everybody.”,0
8235,"“Oh, I’m sure of that. It gets me worried, though.” “Thought any more about going to South America?”  “I mean that.”",0
8236,"“Well, why don’t you start off?”  “Frances.”  “Well,” I said, “take her with you.” “She wouldn’t like it. That isn’t the sort of thing she likes. She likes a lot of people around.”",0
8237,“Tell her to go to hell.” “I can’t. I’ve got certain obligations to her.”,0
8238,"He shoved the sliced cucumbers away and took a pickled herring. “What do you know about Lady Brett Ashley, Jake?”  “Her name’s Lady Ashley. Brett’s her own name. She’s a nice girl,” I said. “She’s getting a divorce and she’s going to marry Mike Campbell. He’s over in Scotland now. Why?”  “She’s a remarkably attractive woman.”  “Isn’t she?”  “There’s a certain quality about her, a certain fineness.",0
8239,"She seems to be absolutely fine and straight.” “She’s very nice.” “I don’t know how to describe the quality,” Cohn said. “I suppose it’s breeding.”  “You sound as though you liked her pretty well.”",0
8240,"“I do. I shouldn’t wonder if I were in love with her.” “She’s a drunk,” I said. “She’s in love with Mike Campbell, and she’s going to marry him. He’s going to be rich as hell some day.”",0
8241,"“I don’t believe she’ll ever marry him.” “Why not?”  “I don’t know. I just don’t believe it. Have you known her a long time?”  “Yes,” I said.",0
8242,“She was a V. A. D. in a hospital I was in during the war.” “She must have been just a kid then.” “She’s thirty-four now.”,0
8243,“When did she marry Ashley?”  “During the war. Her own true love had just kicked off with the dysentery.” “You talk sort of bitter.”  “Sorry.,0
8244,I didn’t mean to. I was just trying to give you the facts.” “I don’t believe she would marry anybody she didn’t love.”,0
8245,"“Well,” I said. “She’s done it twice.” “I don’t believe it.”",0
8246,"“Well,” I said, “don’t ask me a lot of fool questions if you don’t like the answers.” “I didn’t ask you that.” “You asked me what I knew about Brett Ashley.”",0
8247,"“I didn’t ask you to insult her.” “Oh, go to hell.” He stood up from the table his face white, and stood there white and angry behind the little plates of hors d’œuvres.",0
8248,"“Sit down,” I said. “Don’t be a fool.” “You’ve got to take that back.”",0
8249,"“Oh, cut out the prep-school stuff.” “Take it back.” “Sure. Anything. I never heard of Brett Ashley. How’s that?  “No. Not that.",0
8250,"About me going to hell.” “Oh, don’t go to hell,” I said. “Stick around. We’re just starting lunch.”",0
8251,"Cohn smiled again and sat down. He seemed glad to sit down. What the hell would he have done if he hadn’t sat down? “You say such damned insulting things, Jake.”  “I’m sorry.",0
8252,"I’ve got a nasty tongue. I never mean it when I say nasty things.” “I know it,” Cohn said. “You’re really about the best friend I have, Jake.”",0
8253,"God help you, I thought. “Forget what I said,” I said out loud. “I’m sorry.”",0
8254,“It’s all right. It’s fine. I was just sore for a minute.”  “Good.,0
8255,"Let’s get something else to eat.” After we finished the lunch we walked up to the Café de la Paix and had coffee. I could feel Cohn wanted to bring up Brett again, but I held him off it. We talked about one thing and another, and I left him to come to the office.",0
8256,"CHAPTER 6 At five o’clock I was in the Hotel Crillon waiting for Brett. She was not there, so I sat down and wrote some letters. They were not very good letters but I hoped their being on Crillon stationery would help them. Brett did not turn up, so about quarter to six I went down to the bar and had a Jack Rose with George the barman. Brett had not been in the bar either, and so I looked for her up-stairs on my way out, and took a taxi to the Café Select. Crossing the Seine I saw a string of barges being towed empty down the current, riding high, the bargemen at the sweeps as they came toward the bridge. The river looked nice. It was always pleasant crossing bridges in Paris.",0
8257,"The taxi rounded the statue of the inventor of the semaphore engaged in doing same, and turned up the Boulevard Raspail, and I sat back to let that part of the ride pass. The Boulevard Raspail always made dull riding. It was like a certain stretch on the P. L. M. between Fontainebleau and Montereau that always made me feel bored and dead and dull until it was over. I suppose it is some association of ideas that makes those dead places in a journey. There are other streets in Paris as ugly as the Boulevard Raspail. It is a street I do not mind walking down at all. But I cannot stand to ride along it. Perhaps I had read something about it once. That was the way Robert Cohn was about all of Paris. I wondered where Cohn got that incapacity to enjoy Paris. Possibly from Mencken. Mencken hates Paris, I believe. So many young men get their likes and dislikes from Mencken.",0
8258,"The taxi stopped in front of the Rotonde. No matter what café in Montparnasse you ask a taxi-driver to bring you to from the right bank of the river, they always take you to the Rotonde. Ten years from now it will probably be the Dome. It was near enough, anyway. I walked past the sad tables of the Rotonde to the Select. There were a few people inside at the bar, and outside, alone, sat Harvey Stone. He had a pile of saucers in front of him, and he needed a shave.",0
8259,"“Sit down,” said Harvey, “I’ve been looking for you.” “What’s the matter?”  “Nothing. Just looking for you.”  “Been out to the races?”  “No.",0
8260,Not since Sunday.” “What do you hear from the States?”  “Nothing. Absolutely nothing.”,0
8261,“What’s the matter?”  “I don’t know. I’m through with them. I’m absolutely through with them.”,0
8262,"He leaned forward and looked me in the eye. “Do you want to know something, Jake?”  “Yes.”  “I haven’t had anything to eat for five days.”  I figured rapidly back in my mind. It was three days ago that Harvey had won two hundred francs from me shaking poker dice in the New York Bar.",0
8263,"“What’s the matter?”  “No money. Money hasn’t come,” he paused. “I tell you it’s strange, Jake. When I’m like this I just want to be alone. I want to stay in my own room. I’m like a cat.”",0
8264,"I felt in my pocket. “Would a hundred help you any, Harvey?”  “Yes.”  “Come on. Let’s go and eat.”",0
8265,“There’s no hurry. Have a drink.”  “Better eat.” “No. When I get like this I don’t care whether I eat or not.”,0
8266,"We had a drink. Harvey added my saucer to his own pile. “Do you know Mencken, Harvey?”  “Yes.",0
8267,"Why?”  “What’s he like?”  “He’s all right. He says some pretty funny things. Last time I had dinner with him we talked about Hoffenheimer. ‘The trouble is,’ he said, ‘he’s a garter snapper.’ That’s not bad.”",0
8268,"“That’s not bad.”  “He’s through now,” Harvey went on. “He’s written about all the things he knows, and now he’s on all the things he doesn’t know.” “I guess he’s all right,” I said. “I just can’t read him.”",0
8269,"“Oh, nobody reads him now,” Harvey said, “except the people that used to read the Alexander Hamilton Institute.” “Well,” I said. “That was a good thing, too.”",0
8270,"“Sure,” said Harvey. So we sat and thought deeply for a while. “Have another port?”  “All right,” said Harvey.",0
8271,"“There comes Cohn,” I said. Robert Cohn was crossing the street. “That moron,” said Harvey. Cohn came up to our table.",0
8272,"“Hello, you bums,” he said. “Hello, Robert,” Harvey said. “I was just telling Jake here that you’re a moron.”",0
8273,“What do you mean?”  “Tell us right off. Don’t think. What would you rather do if you could do anything you wanted?”  Cohn started to consider.,0
8274,"“Don’t think. Bring it right out.” “I don’t know,” Cohn said. “What’s it all about, anyway?”  “I mean what would you rather do.",0
8275,"What comes into your head first. No matter how silly it is.” “I don’t know,” Cohn said. “I think I’d rather play football again with what I know about handling myself, now.”",0
8276,"“I misjudged you,” Harvey said. “You’re not a moron. You’re only a case of arrested development.”",0
8277,"“You’re awfully funny, Harvey,” Cohn said. “Some day somebody will push your face in.”  Harvey Stone laughed. “You think so. They won’t, though. Because it wouldn’t make any difference to me. I’m not a fighter.”",0
8278,"“It would make a difference to you if anybody did it.” “No, it wouldn’t. That’s where you make your big mistake. Because you’re not intelligent.”  “Cut it out about me.”",0
8279,"“Sure,” said Harvey. “It doesn’t make any difference to me. You don’t mean anything to me.”  “Come on, Harvey,” I said.",0
8280,"“Have another porto.” “No,” he said. “I’m going up the street and eat. See you later, Jake.”",0
8281,"He walked out and up the street. I watched him crossing the street through the taxis, small, heavy, slowly sure of himself in the traffic. “He always gets me sore,” Cohn said. “I can’t stand him.”",0
8282,"“I like him,” I said. “I’m fond of him. You don’t want to get sore at him.”",0
8283,"“I know it,” Cohn said. “He just gets on my nerves.” “Write this afternoon?”  “No.",0
8284,I couldn’t get it going. It’s harder to do than my first book. I’m having a hard time handling it.”,0
8285,"The sort of healthy conceit that he had when he returned from America early in the spring was gone. Then he had been sure of his work, only with these personal longings for adventure. Now the sureness was gone. Somehow I feel I have not shown Robert Cohn clearly. The reason is that until he fell in love with Brett, I never heard him make one remark that would, in any way, detach him from other people. He was nice to watch on the tennis-court, he had a good body, and he kept it in shape; he handled his cards well at bridge, and he had a funny sort of undergraduate quality about him. If he were in a crowd nothing he said stood out. He wore what used to be called polo shirts at school, and may be called that still, but he was not professionally youthful. I do not believe he thought about his clothes much. Externally he had been formed at Princeton. Internally he had been moulded by the two women who had trained him. He had a nice, boyish sort of cheerfulness that had never been trained out of him, and I probably have not brought it out. He loved to win at tennis. He probably loved to win as much as Lenglen, for instance. On the other hand, he was not angry at being beaten. When he fell in love with Brett his tennis game went all to pieces. People beat him who had never had a chance with him. He was very nice about it.",0
8286,"Anyhow, we were sitting on the terrace of the Café Select, and Harvey Stone had just crossed the street. “Come on up to the Lilas,” I said. “I have a date.”",0
8287,“What time?”  “Frances is coming here at seven-fifteen.” “There she is.” Frances Clyne was coming toward us from across the street. She was a very tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement. She waved and smiled. We watched her cross the street.,0
8288,"“Hello,” she said, “I’m so glad you’re here, Jake. I’ve been wanting to talk to you.” “Hello, Frances,” said Cohn. He smiled.",0
8289,"“Why, hello, Robert. Are you here?” She went on, talking rapidly. “I’ve had the darndest time. This one”—shaking her head at Cohn—“didn’t come home for lunch.”",0
8290,"“I wasn’t supposed to.” “Oh, I know. But you didn’t say anything about it to the cook. Then I had a date myself, and Paula wasn’t at her office. I went to the Ritz and waited for her, and she never came, and of course I didn’t have enough money to lunch at the Ritz——”  “What did you do?”  “Oh, went out, of course.”",0
8291,"She spoke in a sort of imitation joyful manner. “I always keep my appointments. No one keeps theirs, nowadays. I ought to know better. How are you, Jake, anyway?”  “Fine.”  “That was a fine girl you had at the dance, and then went off with that Brett one.”  “Don’t you like her?”",0
8292,Cohn asked. “I think she’s perfectly charming. Don’t you?”,0
8293,"Cohn said nothing. “Look, Jake. I want to talk with you. Would you come over with me to the Dome? You’ll stay here, won’t you, Robert? Come on, Jake.”",0
8294,"We crossed the Boulevard Montparnasse and sat down at a table. A boy came up with the Paris Times, and I bought one and opened it. “What’s the matter, Frances?”  “Oh, nothing,” she said, “except that he wants to leave me.”",0
8295,"“How do you mean?”  “Oh, he told every one that we were going to be married, and I told my mother and every one, and now he doesn’t want to do it.” “What’s the matter?”  “He’s decided he hasn’t lived enough. I knew it would happen when he went to New York.”",0
8296,"She looked up, very bright-eyed and trying to talk inconsequentially. “I wouldn’t marry him if he doesn’t want to. Of course I wouldn’t. I wouldn’t marry him now for anything. But it does seem to me to be a little late now, after we’ve waited three years, and I’ve just gotten my divorce.”",0
8297,"I said nothing. “We were going to celebrate so, and instead we’ve just had scenes. It’s so childish. We have dreadful scenes, and he cries and begs me to be reasonable, but he says he just can’t do it.”",0
8298,"“It’s rotten luck.” “I should say it is rotten luck. I’ve wasted two years and a half on him now. And I don’t know now if any man will ever want to marry me. Two years ago I could have married anybody I wanted, down at Cannes. All the old ones that wanted to marry somebody chic and settle down were crazy about me. Now I don’t think I could get anybody.”",0
8299,"“Sure, you could marry anybody.” “No, I don’t believe it. And I’m fond of him, too. And I’d like to have children. I always thought we’d have children.”",0
8300,"She looked at me very brightly. “I never liked children much, but I don’t want to think I’ll never have them. I always thought I’d have them and then like them.”",0
8301,"“He’s got children.” “Oh, yes. He’s got children, and he’s got money, and he’s got a rich mother, and he’s written a book, and nobody will publish my stuff; nobody at all. It isn’t bad, either. And I haven’t got any money at all. I could have had alimony, but I got the divorce the quickest way.”",0
8302,"She looked at me again very brightly. “It isn’t right. It’s my own fault and it’s not, too. I ought to have known better. And when I tell him he just cries and says he can’t marry. Why can’t he marry? I’d be a good wife. I’m easy to get along with. I leave him alone. It doesn’t do any good.”",0
8303,"“It’s a rotten shame.” “Yes, it is a rotten shame. But there’s no use talking about it, is there? Come on, let’s go back to the café.”",0
8304,"“And of course there isn’t anything I can do.” “No. Just don’t let him know I talked to you. I know what he wants.” Now for the first time she dropped her bright, terribly cheerful manner. “He wants to go back to New York alone, and be there when his book comes out so when a lot of little chickens like it. That’s what he wants.”",0
8305,"“Maybe they won’t like it. I don’t think he’s that way. Really.”  “You don’t know him like I do, Jake.",0
8306,That’s what he wants to do. I know it. I know it. That’s why he doesn’t want to marry. He wants to have a big triumph this fall all by himself.”  “Want to go back to the café?”  “Yes. Come on.”,0
8307,"We got up from the table—they had never brought us a drink—and started across the street toward the Select, where Cohn sat smiling at us from behind the marble-topped table. “Well, what are you smiling at?” Frances asked him. “Feel pretty happy?”  “I was smiling at you and Jake with your secrets.”",0
8308,"“Oh, what I’ve told Jake isn’t any secret. Everybody will know it soon enough. I only wanted to give Jake a decent version.”",0
8309,"“What was it? About your going to England?”  “Yes, about my going to England. Oh, Jake! I forgot to tell you. I’m going to England.”  “Isn’t that fine!”",0
8310,"“Yes, that’s the way it’s done in the very best families. Robert’s sending me. He’s going to give me two hundred pounds and then I’m going to visit friends. Won’t it be lovely? The friends don’t know about it, yet.”",0
8311,"She turned to Cohn and smiled at him. He was not smiling now. “You were only going to give me a hundred pounds, weren’t you, Robert? But I made him give me two hundred. He’s really very generous. Aren’t you, Robert?”  I do not know how people could say such terrible things to Robert Cohn.",0
8312,"There are people to whom you could not say insulting things. They give you a feeling that the world would be destroyed, would actually be destroyed before your eyes, if you said certain things. But here was Cohn taking it all. Here it was, all going on right before me, and I did not even feel an impulse to try and stop it. And this was friendly joking to what went on later.",0
8313,"“How can you say such things, Frances?” Cohn interrupted. “Listen to him. I’m going to England. I’m going to visit friends. Ever visit friends that didn’t want you? Oh, they’ll have to take me, all right. ‘How do you do, my dear? Such a long time since we’ve seen you. And how is your dear mother?’ Yes, how is my dear mother? She put all her money into French war bonds. Yes, she did. Probably the only person in the world that did. ‘And what about Robert?’ or else very careful talking around Robert. ‘You must be most careful not to mention him, my dear. Poor Frances has had a most unfortunate experience.’ Won’t it be fun, Robert? Don’t you think it will be fun, Jake?”  She turned to me with that terribly bright smile.",0
8314,"It was very satisfactory to her to have an audience for this. “And where are you going to be, Robert? It’s my own fault, all right. Perfectly my own fault. When I made you get rid of your little secretary on the magazine I ought to have known you’d get rid of me the same way. Jake doesn’t know about that. Should I tell him?”  “Shut up, Frances, for God’s sake.”",0
8315,"“Yes, I’ll tell him. Robert had a little secretary on the magazine. Just the sweetest little thing in the world, and he thought she was wonderful, and then I came along and he thought I was pretty wonderful, too. So I made him get rid of her, and he had brought her to Provincetown from Carmel when he moved the magazine, and he didn’t even pay her fare back to the coast. All to please me. He thought I was pretty fine, then. Didn’t you, Robert?",0
8316,"“You mustn’t misunderstand, Jake, it was absolutely platonic with the secretary. Not even platonic. Nothing at all, really. It was just that she was so nice. And he did that just to please me. Well, I suppose that we that live by the sword shall perish by the sword. Isn’t that literary, though? You want to remember that for your next book, Robert.",0
8317,"“You know Robert is going to get material for a new book. Aren’t you, Robert? That’s why he’s leaving me. He’s decided I don’t film well. You see, he was so busy all the time that we were living together, writing on this book, that he doesn’t remember anything about us. So now he’s going out and get some new material. Well, I hope he gets something frightfully interesting.",0
8318,"“Listen, Robert, dear. Let me tell you something. You won’t mind, will you? Don’t have scenes with your young ladies. Try not to. Because you can’t have scenes without crying, and then you pity yourself so much you can’t remember what the other person’s said. You’ll never be able to remember any conversations that way. Just try and be calm. I know it’s awfully hard. But remember, it’s for literature. We all ought to make sacrifices for literature. Look at me. I’m going to England without a protest. All for literature. We must all help young writers. Don’t you think so, Jake? But you’re not a young writer. Are you, Robert? You’re thirty-four. Still, I suppose that is young for a great writer. Look at Hardy. Look at Anatole France. He just died a little while ago. Robert doesn’t think he’s any good, though. Some of his French friends told him. He doesn’t read French very well himself. He wasn’t a good writer like you are, was he, Robert? Do you think he ever had to go and look for material? What do you suppose he said to his mistresses when he wouldn’t marry them? I wonder if he cried, too? Oh, I’ve just thought of something.” She put her gloved hand up to her lips. “I know the real reason why Robert won’t marry me, Jake. It’s just come to me. They’ve sent it to me in a vision in the Café Select. Isn’t it mystic? Some day they’ll put a tablet up. Like at Lourdes. Do you want to hear, Robert? I’ll tell you. It’s so simple. I wonder why I never thought about it. Why, you see, Robert’s always wanted to have a mistress, and if he doesn’t marry me, why, then he’s had one. She was his mistress for over two years. See how it is? And if he marries me, like he’s always promised he would, that would be the end of all the romance. Don’t you think that’s bright of me to figure that out? It’s true, too. Look at him and see if it’s not. Where are you going, Jake?”  “I’ve got to go in and see Harvey Stone a minute.”",0
8319,Cohn looked up as I went in. His face was white. Why did he sit there? Why did he keep on taking it like that?,0
8320,"As I stood against the bar looking out I could see them through the window. Frances was talking on to him, smiling brightly, looking into his face each time she asked: “Isn’t it so, Robert?” Or maybe she did not ask that now. Perhaps she said something else. I told the barman I did not want anything to drink and went out through the side door. As I went out the door I looked back through the two thicknesses of glass and saw them sitting there. She was still talking to him. I went down a side street to the Boulevard Raspail. A taxi came along and I got in and gave the driver the address of my flat.",0
8321,"CHAPTER 7 As I started up the stairs the concierge knocked on the glass of the door of her lodge, and as I stopped she came out. She had some letters and a telegram. “Here is the post. And there was a lady here to see you.”",0
8322,“Did she leave a card?”  “No. She was with a gentleman. It was the one who was here last night. In the end I find she is very nice.”,0
8323,"“Was she with a friend of mine?”  “I don’t know. He was never here before. He was very large. Very, very large. She was very nice. Very, very nice. Last night she was, perhaps, a little—” She put her head on one hand and rocked it up and down. “I’ll speak perfectly frankly, Monsieur Barnes. Last night I found her not so gentille. Last night I formed another idea of her. But listen to what I tell you. She is très, très gentille. She is of very good family. It is a thing you can see.”",0
8324,"“They did not leave any word?”  “Yes. They said they would be back in an hour.”  “Send them up when they come.” “Yes, Monsieur Barnes. And that lady, that lady there is some one. An eccentric, perhaps, but quelqu’une, quelqu’une!”",0
8325,"The concierge, before she became a concierge, had owned a drink-selling concession at the Paris race-courses. Her life-work lay in the pelouse, but she kept an eye on the people of the pesage, and she took great pride in telling me which of my guests were well brought up, which were of good family, who were sportsmen, a French word pronounced with the accent on the men. The only trouble was that people who did not fall into any of those three categories were very liable to be told there was no one home, chez Barnes. One of my friends, an extremely underfed-looking painter, who was obviously to Madame Duzinell neither well brought up, of good family, nor a sportsman, wrote me a letter asking if I could get him a pass to get by the concierge so he could come up and see me occasionally in the evenings.",0
8326,"I went up to the flat wondering what Brett had done to the concierge. The wire was a cable from Bill Gorton, saying he was arriving on the France. I put the mail on the table, went back to the bedroom, undressed and had a shower. I was rubbing down when I heard the door-bell pull. I put on a bathrobe and slippers and went to the door. It was Brett. Back of her was the count. He was holding a great bunch of roses.",0
8327,"“Hello, darling,” said Brett. “Aren’t you going to let us in?”  “Come on. I was just bathing.”  “Aren’t you the fortunate man.",0
8328,"Bathing.”  “Only a shower. Sit down, Count Mippipopolous. What will you drink?”  “I don’t know whether you like flowers, sir,” the count said, “but I took the liberty of just bringing these roses.”  “Here, give them to me.”",0
8329,"Brett took them. “Get me some water in this, Jake.” I filled the big earthenware jug with water in the kitchen, and Brett put the roses in it, and placed them in the centre of the dining-room table.",0
8330,“I say. We have had a day.” “You don’t remember anything about a date with me at the Crillon?”  “No.,0
8331,"Did we have one? I must have been blind.” “You were quite drunk, my dear,” said the count.",0
8332,"“Wasn’t I, though? And the count’s been a brick, absolutely.” “You’ve got hell’s own drag with the concierge now.”",0
8333,"“I ought to have. Gave her two hundred francs.”  “Don’t be a damned fool.” “His,” she said, and nodded at the count.",0
8334,"“I thought we ought to give her a little something for last night. It was very late.” “He’s wonderful,” Brett said. “He remembers everything that’s happened.”",0
8335,"“So do you, my dear.”  “Fancy,” said Brett. “Who’d want to? I say, Jake, do we get a drink?”  “You get it while I go in and dress.",0
8336,"You know where it is.” “Rather.” While I dressed I heard Brett put down glasses and then a siphon, and then heard them talking. I dressed slowly, sitting on the bed. I felt tired and pretty rotten. Brett came in the room, a glass in her hand, and sat on the bed.",0
8337,"“What’s the matter, darling? Do you feel rocky?”  She kissed me coolly on the forehead. “Oh, Brett, I love you so much.”",0
8338,"“Darling,” she said. Then: “Do you want me to send him away?”  “No. He’s nice.”  “I’ll send him away.”",0
8339,"“No, don’t.” “Yes, I’ll send him away.” “You can’t just like that.”  “Can’t I, though?",0
8340,"You stay here. He’s mad about me, I tell you.” She was gone out of the room. I lay face down on the bed. I was having a bad time. I heard them talking but I did not listen. Brett came in and sat on the bed.",0
8341,“Poor old darling.” She stroked my head. “What did you say to him?” I was lying with my face away from her. I did not want to see her.,0
8342,"“Sent him for champagne. He loves to go for champagne.” Then later: “Do you feel better, darling? Is the head any better?”  “It’s better.”",0
8343,"“Lie quiet. He’s gone to the other side of town.”  “Couldn’t we live together, Brett? Couldn’t we just live together?”  “I don’t think so.",0
8344,I’d just tromper you with everybody. You couldn’t stand it.” “I stand it now.”,0
8345,"“That would be different. It’s my fault, Jake. It’s the way I’m made.”  “Couldn’t we go off in the country for a while?”  “It wouldn’t be any good.",0
8346,I’ll go if you like. But I couldn’t live quietly in the country. Not with my own true love.”,0
8347,“I know.”  “Isn’t it rotten? There isn’t any use my telling you I love you.”,0
8348,"“You know I love you.” “Let’s not talk. Talking’s all bilge. I’m going away from you, and then Michael’s coming back.”",0
8349,“Why are you going away?”  “Better for you. Better for me.” “When are you going?”  “Soon as I can.”  “Where?”  “San Sebastian.”  “Can’t we go together?”  “No.,0
8350,"That would be a hell of an idea after we’d just talked it out.” “We never agreed.” “Oh, you know as well as I do. Don’t be obstinate, darling.”",0
8351,"“Oh, sure,” I said. “I know you’re right. I’m just low, and when I’m low I talk like a fool.”",0
8352,"I sat up, leaned over, found my shoes beside the bed and put them on. I stood up. “Don’t look like that, darling.”",0
8353,"“How do you want me to look?”  “Oh, don’t be a fool. I’m going away to-morrow.”  “To-morrow?”  “Yes. Didn’t I say so? I am.”",0
8354,"“Let’s have a drink, then. The count will be back.” “Yes. He should be back. You know he’s extraordinary about buying champagne. It means any amount to him.”",0
8355,We went into the dining-room. I took up the brandy bottle and poured Brett a drink and one for myself. There was a ring at the bell-pull. I went to the door and there was the count. Behind him was the chauffeur carrying a basket of champagne.,0
8356,"“Where should I have him put it, sir?” asked the count. “In the kitchen,” Brett said. “Put it in there, Henry,” the count motioned. “Now go down and get the ice.” He stood looking after the basket inside the kitchen door. “I think you’ll find that’s very good wine,” he said. “I know we don’t get much of a chance to judge good wine in the States now, but I got this from a friend of mine that’s in the business.”",0
8357,"“Oh, you always have some one in the trade,” Brett said. “This fellow raises the grapes. He’s got thousands of acres of them.”",0
8358,"“What’s his name?” asked Brett. “Veuve Cliquot?”  “No,” said the count. “Mumms. He’s a baron.”  “Isn’t it wonderful,” said Brett.",0
8359,"“We all have titles. Why haven’t you a title, Jake?”  “I assure you, sir,” the count put his hand on my arm. “It never does a man any good. Most of the time it costs you money.”",0
8360,"“Oh, I don’t know. It’s damned useful sometimes,” Brett said. “I’ve never known it to do me any good.”",0
8361,"“You haven’t used it properly. I’ve had hell’s own amount of credit on mine.” “Do sit down, count,” I said. “Let me take that stick.”",0
8362,"The count was looking at Brett across the table under the gas-light. She was smoking a cigarette and flicking the ashes on the rug. She saw me notice it. “I say, Jake, I don’t want to ruin your rugs. Can’t you give a chap an ash-tray?”  I found some ash-trays and spread them around.",0
8363,"The chauffeur came up with a bucket full of salted ice. “Put two bottles in it, Henry,” the count called. “Anything else, sir?”  “No. Wait down in the car.”",0
8364,"He turned to Brett and to me. “We’ll want to ride out to the Bois for dinner?”  “If you like,” Brett said. “I couldn’t eat a thing.”",0
8365,"“I always like a good meal,” said the count. “Should I bring the wine in, sir?” asked the chauffeur. “Yes. Bring it in, Henry,” said the count. He took out a heavy pigskin cigar-case and offered it to me. “Like to try a real American cigar?”  “Thanks,” I said.",0
8366,"“I’ll finish the cigarette.” He cut off the end of his cigar with a gold cutter he wore on one end of his watch-chain. “I like a cigar to really draw,” said the count “Half the cigars you smoke don’t draw.”",0
8367,"He lit the cigar, puffed at it, looking across the table at Brett. “And when you’re divorced, Lady Ashley, then you won’t have a title.” “No. What a pity.”  “No,” said the count.",0
8368,“You don’t need a title. You got class all over you.” “Thanks. Awfully decent of you.”,0
8369,"“I’m not joking you,” the count blew a cloud of smoke. “You got the most class of anybody I ever seen. You got it. That’s all.”",0
8370,"“Nice of you,” said Brett. “Mummy would be pleased. Couldn’t you write it out, and I’ll send it in a letter to her.”",0
8371,"“I’d tell her, too,” said the count. “I’m not joking you. I never joke people. Joke people and you make enemies. That’s what I always say.”",0
8372,"“You’re right,” Brett said. “You’re terribly right. I always joke people and I haven’t a friend in the world. Except Jake here.”  “You don’t joke him.”",0
8373,"“That’s it.” “Do you, now?” asked the count. “Do you joke him?”  Brett looked at me and wrinkled up the corners of her eyes.",0
8374,"“No,” she said. “I wouldn’t joke him.”  “See,” said the count. “You don’t joke him.”",0
8375,"“This is a hell of a dull talk,” Brett said. “How about some of that champagne?”  The count reached down and twirled the bottles in the shiny bucket. “It isn’t cold, yet. You’re always drinking, my dear. Why don’t you just talk?”  “I’ve talked too ruddy much.",0
8376,"I’ve talked myself all out to Jake.” “I should like to hear you really talk, my dear. When you talk to me you never finish your sentences at all.”  “Leave ’em for you to finish.",0
8377,"Let any one finish them as they like.” “It is a very interesting system,” the count reached down and gave the bottles a twirl. “Still I would like to hear you talk some time.”  “Isn’t he a fool?”",0
8378,"Brett asked. “Now,” the count brought up a bottle. “I think this is cool.”",0
8379,"I brought a towel and he wiped the bottle dry and held it up. “I like to drink champagne from magnums. The wine is better but it would have been too hard to cool.” He held the bottle, looking at it. I put out the glasses.",0
8380,"“I say. You might open it,” Brett suggested. “Yes, my dear. Now I’ll open it.”",0
8381,"It was amazing champagne. “I say that is wine,” Brett held up her glass. “We ought to toast something. ‘Here’s to royalty.’ ”  “This wine is too good for toast-drinking, my dear.",0
8382,"You don’t want to mix emotions up with a wine like that. You lose the taste.”  Brett’s glass was empty. “You ought to write a book on wines, count,” I said.",0
8383,"“Mr. Barnes,” answered the count, “all I want out of wines is to enjoy them.”  “Let’s enjoy a little more of this,” Brett pushed her glass forward. The count poured very carefully. “There, my dear. Now you enjoy that slowly, and then you can get drunk.”",0
8384,"“Drunk? Drunk?”  “My dear, you are charming when you are drunk.”  “Listen to the man.” “Mr. Barnes,” the count poured my glass full. “She is the only lady I have ever known who was as charming when she was drunk as when she was sober.”",0
8385,"“You haven’t been around much, have you?”  “Yes, my dear. I have been around very much. I have been around a very great deal.”",0
8386,"“Drink your wine,” said Brett. “We’ve all been around. I dare say Jake here has seen as much as you have.”",0
8387,"“My dear, I am sure Mr. Barnes has seen a lot. Don’t think I don’t think so, sir. I have seen a lot, too.”",0
8388,"“Of course you have, my dear,” Brett said. “I was only ragging.” “I have been in seven wars and four revolutions,” the count said.",0
8389,"“Soldiering?” Brett asked. “Sometimes, my dear. And I have got arrow wounds. Have you ever seen arrow wounds?”  “Let’s have a look at them.”",0
8390,"The count stood up, unbuttoned his vest, and opened his shirt. He pulled up the undershirt onto his chest and stood, his chest black, and big stomach muscles bulging under the light. “You see them?”  Below the line where his ribs stopped were two raised white welts.",0
8391,"“See on the back where they come out.” Above the small of the back were the same two scars, raised as thick as a finger. “I say. Those are something.”  “Clean through.”",0
8392,The count was tucking in his shirt. “Where did you get those?” I asked. “In Abyssinia. When I was twenty-one years old.”,0
8393,"“What were you doing?” asked Brett. “Were you in the army?”  “I was on a business trip, my dear.” “I told you he was one of us. Didn’t I?” Brett turned to me. “I love you, count. You’re a darling.”",0
8394,"“You make me very happy, my dear. But it isn’t true.”  “Don’t be an ass.” “You see, Mr. Barnes, it is because I have lived very much that now I can enjoy everything so well. Don’t you find it like that?”  “Yes.",0
8395,"Absolutely.”  “I know,” said the count. “That is the secret. You must get to know the values.”  “Doesn’t anything ever happen to your values?”",0
8396,"Brett asked. “No. Not any more.”  “Never fall in love?”  “Always,” said the count. “I am always in love.”",0
8397,"“What does that do to your values?”  “That, too, has got a place in my values.” “You haven’t any values. You’re dead, that’s all.”",0
8398,"“No, my dear. You’re not right. I’m not dead at all.”",0
8399,We drank three bottles of the champagne and the count left the basket in my kitchen. We dined at a restaurant in the Bois. It was a good dinner. Food had an excellent place in the count’s values. So did wine. The count was in fine form during the meal. So was Brett. It was a good party.,0
8400,“Where would you like to go?” asked the count after dinner. We were the only people left in the restaurant. The two waiters were standing over against the door. They wanted to go home.,0
8401,"“We might go up on the hill,” Brett said. “Haven’t we had a splendid party?” The count was beaming. He was very happy.",0
8402,"“You are very nice people,” he said. He was smoking a cigar again. “Why don’t you get married, you two?”  “We want to lead our own lives,” I said.",0
8403,"“We have our careers,” Brett said. “Come on. Let’s get out of this.”  “Have another brandy,” the count said.",0
8404,"“Get it on the hill.”  “No. Have it here where it is quiet.” “You and your quiet,” said Brett. “What is it men feel about quiet?”  “We like it,” said the count.",0
8405,"“Like you like noise, my dear.”  “All right,” said Brett. “Let’s have one.” “Sommelier!” the count called.",0
8406,"“Yes, sir.”  “What is the oldest brandy you have?”  “Eighteen eleven, sir.”  “Bring us a bottle.” “I say. Don’t be ostentatious. Call him off, Jake.”  “Listen, my dear.",0
8407,"I get more value for my money in old brandy than in any other antiquities.”  “Got many antiquities?”  “I got a houseful.” Finally we went up to Montmartre. Inside Zelli’s it was crowded, smoky, and noisy. The music hit you as you went in. Brett and I danced. It was so crowded we could barely move. The nigger drummer waved at Brett. We were caught in the jam, dancing in one place in front of him.",0
8408,"“Hahre you?”  “Great.”  “Thaats good.” He was all teeth and lips. “He’s a great friend of mine,” Brett said. “Damn good drummer.”",0
8409,The music stopped and we started toward the table where the count sat. Then the music started again and we danced. I looked at the count. He was sitting at the table smoking a cigar. The music stopped again.,0
8410,"“Let’s go over.” Brett started toward the table. The music started and again we danced, tight in the crowd.",0
8411,"“You are a rotten dancer, Jake. Michael’s the best dancer I know.” “He’s splendid.”  “He’s got his points.”  “I like him,” I said.",0
8412,"“I’m damned fond of him.” “I’m going to marry him,” Brett said. “Funny. I haven’t thought about him for a week.”  “Don’t you write him?”  “Not I. Never write letters.”",0
8413,"“I’ll bet he writes to you.”  “Rather. Damned good letters, too.”  “When are you going to get married?”  “How do I know? As soon as we can get the divorce. Michael’s trying to get his mother to put up for it.”",0
8414,“Could I help you?”  “Don’t be an ass. Michael’s people have loads of money.” The music stopped. We walked over to the table. The count stood up.,0
8415,"“Very nice,” he said. “You looked very, very nice.”  “Don’t you dance, count?” I asked.",0
8416,"“No. I’m too old.” “Oh, come off it,” Brett said.",0
8417,"“My dear, I would do it if I would enjoy it. I enjoy to watch you dance.” “Splendid,” Brett said. “I’ll dance again for you some time. I say. What about your little friend, Zizi?”  “Let me tell you.",0
8418,"I support that boy, but I don’t want to have him around.” “He is rather hard.” “You know I think that boy’s got a future. But personally I don’t want him around.”",0
8419,"“Jake’s rather the same way.”  “He gives me the willys.” “Well,” the count shrugged his shoulders. “About his future you can’t ever tell. Anyhow, his father was a great friend of my father.”  “Come on.",0
8420,"Let’s dance,” Brett said. We danced. It was crowded and close.",0
8421,"“Oh, darling,” Brett said, “I’m so miserable.” I had that feeling of going through something that has all happened before. “You were happy a minute ago.”",0
8422,The drummer shouted: “You can’t two time—”  “It’s all gone.”  “What’s the matter?”  “I don’t know. I just feel terribly.”  “. . . . . .” the drummer chanted. Then turned to his sticks.,0
8423,"“Want to go?”  I had the feeling as in a nightmare of it all being something repeated, something I had been through and that now I must go through again. “. . . . . .” the drummer sang softly.",0
8424,"“Let’s go,” said Brett. “You don’t mind.”  “. . . . . .” the drummer shouted and grinned at Brett.",0
8425,"“All right,” I said. We got out from the crowd. Brett went to the dressing-room.",0
8426,"“Brett wants to go,” I said to the count. He nodded. “Does she? That’s fine. You take the car. I’m going to stay here for a while, Mr. Barnes.”",0
8427,"We shook hands. “It was a wonderful time,” I said. “I wish you would let me get this.” I took a note out of my pocket.",0
8428,"“Mr. Barnes, don’t be ridiculous,” the count said. Brett came over with her wrap on. She kissed the count and put her hand on his shoulder to keep him from standing up. As we went out the door I looked back and there were three girls at his table. We got into the big car. Brett gave the chauffeur the address of her hotel.",0
8429,"“No, don’t come up,” she said at the hotel. She had rung and the door was unlatched. “Really?”  “No. Please.”  “Good night, Brett,” I said.",0
8430,"“I’m sorry you feel rotten.”  “Good night, Jake. Good night, darling. I won’t see you again.” We kissed standing at the door. She pushed me away. We kissed again. “Oh, don’t!” Brett said.",0
8431,"She turned quickly and went into the hotel. The chauffeur drove me around to my flat. I gave him twenty francs and he touched his cap and said: “Good night, sir,” and drove off. I rang the bell. The door opened and I went up-stairs and went to bed.",0
8432,"BOOK II   CHAPTER 8 I did not see Brett again until she came back from San Sebastian. One card came from her from there. It had a picture of the Concha, and said: “Darling. Very quiet and healthy. Love to all the chaps. Brett.”",0
8433,"Nor did I see Robert Cohn again. I heard Frances had left for England and I had a note from Cohn saying he was going out in the country for a couple of weeks, he did not know where, but that he wanted to hold me to the fishing-trip in Spain we had talked about last winter. I could reach him always, he wrote, through his bankers.",0
8434,"Brett was gone, I was not bothered by Cohn’s troubles, I rather enjoyed not having to play tennis, there was plenty of work to do, I went often to the races, dined with friends, and put in some extra time at the office getting things ahead so I could leave it in charge of my secretary when Bill Gorton and I should shove off to Spain the end of June. Bill Gorton arrived, put up a couple of days at the flat and went off to Vienna. He was very cheerful and said the States were wonderful. New York was wonderful. There had been a grand theatrical season and a whole crop of great young light heavyweights. Any one of them was a good prospect to grow up, put on weight and trim Dempsey. Bill was very happy. He had made a lot of money on his last book, and was going to make a lot more. We had a good time while he was in Paris, and then he went off to Vienna. He was coming back in three weeks and we would leave for Spain to get in some fishing and go to the fiesta at Pamplona. He wrote that Vienna was wonderful. Then a card from Budapest: “Jake, Budapest is wonderful.” Then I got a wire: “Back on Monday.”",0
8435,"Monday evening he turned up at the flat. I heard his taxi stop and went to the window and called to him; he waved and started up-stairs carrying his bags. I met him on the stairs, and took one of the bags.",0
8436,"“Well,” I said, “I hear you had a wonderful trip.”  “Wonderful,” he said. “Budapest is absolutely wonderful.” “How about Vienna?”  “Not so good, Jake.",0
8437,Not so good. It seemed better than it was.” “How do you mean?” I was getting glasses and a siphon.,0
8438,"“Tight, Jake. I was tight.” “That’s strange. Better have a drink.”",0
8439,"Bill rubbed his forehead. “Remarkable thing,” he said. “Don’t know how it happened. Suddenly it happened.”  “Last long?”  “Four days, Jake.",0
8440,Lasted just four days.” “Where did you go?”  “Don’t remember. Wrote you a post-card. Remember that perfectly.”  “Do anything else?”  “Not so sure.,0
8441,Possible.”  “Go on. Tell me about it.” “Can’t remember. Tell you anything I could remember.”  “Go on.,0
8442,"Take that drink and remember.”  “Might remember a little,” Bill said. “Remember something about a prize-fight. Enormous Vienna prize-fight. Had a nigger in it. Remember the nigger perfectly.”  “Go on.”  “Wonderful nigger.",0
8443,"Looked like Tiger Flowers, only four times as big. All of a sudden everybody started to throw things. Not me. Nigger’d just knocked local boy down. Nigger put up his glove. Wanted to make a speech. Awful noble-looking nigger. Started to make a speech. Then local white boy hit him. Then he knocked white boy cold. Then everybody commenced to throw chairs. Nigger went home with us in our car. Couldn’t get his clothes. Wore my coat. Remember the whole thing now. Big sporting evening.”  “What happened?”  “Loaned the nigger some clothes and went around with him to try and get his money.",0
8444,Claimed nigger owed them money on account of wrecking hall. Wonder who translated? Was it me?”  “Probably it wasn’t you.”,0
8445,"“You’re right. Wasn’t me at all. Was another fellow. Think we called him the local Harvard man. Remember him now. Studying music.”  “How’d you come out?”  “Not so good, Jake.",0
8446,"Injustice everywhere. Promoter claimed nigger promised let local boy stay. Claimed nigger violated contract. Can’t knock out Vienna boy in Vienna. ‘My God, Mister Gorton,’ said nigger, ‘I didn’t do nothing in there for forty minutes but try and let him stay. That white boy musta ruptured himself swinging at me. I never did hit him.’ ”  “Did you get any money?”  “No money, Jake.",0
8447,"All we could get was nigger’s clothes. Somebody took his watch, too. Splendid nigger. Big mistake to have come to Vienna. Not so good, Jake. Not so good.”",0
8448,“What became of the nigger?”  “Went back to Cologne. Lives there. Married. Got a family. Going to write me a letter and send me the money I loaned him. Wonderful nigger. Hope I gave him the right address.”,0
8449,"“You probably did.” “Well, anyway, let’s eat,” said Bill. “Unless you want me to tell you some more travel stories.”  “Go on.”  “Let’s eat.”",0
8450,We went down-stairs and out onto the Boulevard St. Michel in the warm June evening. “Where will we go?”  “Want to eat on the island?”  “Sure.” We walked down the Boulevard. At the juncture of the Rue Denfert-Rochereau with the Boulevard is a statue of two men in flowing robes.,0
8451,“I know who they are.” Bill eyed the monument. “Gentlemen who invented pharmacy. Don’t try and fool me on Paris.”,0
8452,"We went on. “Here’s a taxidermist’s,” Bill said. “Want to buy anything? Nice stuffed dog?”  “Come on,” I said.",0
8453,"“You’re pie-eyed.”  “Pretty nice stuffed dogs,” Bill said. “Certainly brighten up your flat.”  “Come on.” “Just one stuffed dog. I can take ’em or leave ’em alone. But listen, Jake. Just one stuffed dog.”  “Come on.”",0
8454,“Mean everything in the world to you after you bought it. Simple exchange of values. You give them money. They give you a stuffed dog.”,0
8455,“We’ll get one on the way back.” “All right. Have it your own way. Road to hell paved with unbought stuffed dogs. Not my fault.”,0
8456,We went on. “How’d you feel that way about dogs so sudden?”  “Always felt that way about dogs. Always been a great lover of stuffed animals.”,0
8457,"We stopped and had a drink. “Certainly like to drink,” Bill said. “You ought to try it some times, Jake.”  “You’re about a hundred and forty-four ahead of me.”  “Ought not to daunt you.",0
8458,Never be daunted. Secret of my success. Never been daunted. Never been daunted in public.”,0
8459,“Where were you drinking?”  “Stopped at the Crillon. George made me a couple of Jack Roses. George’s a great man. Know the secret of his success? Never been daunted.”,0
8460,“You’ll be daunted after about three more pernods.” “Not in public. If I begin to feel daunted I’ll go off by myself. I’m like a cat that way.”,0
8461,“When did you see Harvey Stone?”  “At the Crillon. Harvey was just a little daunted. Hadn’t eaten for three days. Doesn’t eat any more. Just goes off like a cat. Pretty sad.”  “He’s all right.”  “Splendid.,0
8462,"Wish he wouldn’t keep going off like a cat, though. Makes me nervous.” “What’ll we do to-night?”  “Doesn’t make any difference.",0
8463,Only let’s not get daunted. Suppose they got any hard-boiled eggs here? If they had hard-boiled eggs here we wouldn’t have to go all the way down to the island to eat.”,0
8464,"“Nix,” I said. “We’re going to have a regular meal.” “Just a suggestion,” said Bill. “Want to start now?”  “Come on.”",0
8465,We started on again down the Boulevard. A horse-cab passed us. Bill looked at it.,0
8466,“See that horse-cab? Going to have that horse-cab stuffed for you for Christmas. Going to give all my friends stuffed animals. I’m a nature-writer.”,0
8467,"A taxi passed, some one in it waved, then banged for the driver to stop. The taxi backed up to the curb. In it was Brett.",0
8468,"“Beautiful lady,” said Bill. “Going to kidnap us.” “Hullo!” Brett said. “Hullo!”  “This is Bill Gorton.",0
8469,Lady Ashley.” Brett smiled at Bill. “I say I’m just back. Haven’t bathed even. Michael comes in to-night.”,0
8470,"“Good. Come on and eat with us, and we’ll all go to meet him.”  “Must clean myself.” “Oh, rot! Come on.”",0
8471,"“Must bathe. He doesn’t get in till nine.”  “Come and have a drink, then, before you bathe.” “Might do that. Now you’re not talking rot.”",0
8472,"We got in the taxi. The driver looked around. “Stop at the nearest bistro,” I said.",0
8473,"“We might as well go to the Closerie,” Brett said. “I can’t drink these rotten brandies.” “Closerie des Lilas.”",0
8474,Brett turned to Bill. “Have you been in this pestilential city long?”  “Just got in to-day from Budapest.” “How was Budapest?”  “Wonderful.,0
8475,"Budapest was wonderful.”  “Ask him about Vienna.” “Vienna,” said Bill, “is a strange city.” “Very much like Paris,” Brett smiled at him, wrinkling the corners of her eyes.",0
8476,"“Exactly,” Bill said. “Very much like Paris at this moment.” “You have a good start.”  Sitting out on the terraces of the Lilas Brett ordered a whiskey and soda, I took one, too, and Bill took another pernod.",0
8477,"“How are you, Jake?”  “Great,” I said. “I’ve had a good time.”  Brett looked at me. “I was a fool to go away,” she said. “One’s an ass to leave Paris.”",0
8478,"“Did you have a good time?”  “Oh, all right. Interesting. Not frightfully amusing.”  “See anybody?”  “No, hardly anybody.",0
8479,"I never went out.”  “Didn’t you swim?”  “No. Didn’t do a thing.” “Sounds like Vienna,” Bill said. Brett wrinkled up the corners of her eyes at him.",0
8480,“So that’s the way it was in Vienna.” “It was like everything in Vienna.” Brett smiled at him again.,0
8481,"“You’ve a nice friend, Jake.”  “He’s all right,” I said. “He’s a taxidermist.” “That was in another country,” Bill said. “And besides all the animals were dead.”",0
8482,"“One more,” Brett said, “and I must run. Do send the waiter for a taxi.” “There’s a line of them. Right out in front.”",0
8483,“Good.” We had the drink and put Brett into her taxi. “Mind you’re at the Select around ten. Make him come. Michael will be there.”,0
8484,"“We’ll be there,” Bill said. The taxi started and Brett waved. “Quite a girl,” Bill said. “She’s damned nice. Who’s Michael?”  “The man she’s going to marry.”",0
8485,"“Well, well,” Bill said. “That’s always just the stage I meet anybody. What’ll I send them? Think they’d like a couple of stuffed race-horses?”  “We better eat.”",0
8486,"“Is she really Lady something or other?” Bill asked in the taxi on our way down to the Ile Saint Louis. “Oh, yes. In the stud-book and everything.”  “Well, well.”",0
8487,"We ate dinner at Madame Lecomte’s restaurant on the far side of the island. It was crowded with Americans and we had to stand up and wait for a place. Some one had put it in the American Women’s Club list as a quaint restaurant on the Paris quais as yet untouched by Americans, so we had to wait forty-five minutes for a table. Bill had eaten at the restaurant in 1918, and right after the armistice, and Madame Lecomte made a great fuss over seeing him.",0
8488,"“Doesn’t get us a table, though,” Bill said. “Grand woman, though.” We had a good meal, a roast chicken, new green beans, mashed potatoes, a salad, and some apple-pie and cheese.",0
8489,"“You’ve got the world here all right,” Bill said to Madame Lecomte. She raised her hand. “Oh, my God!”  “You’ll be rich.”",0
8490,"“I hope so.” After the coffee and a fine we got the bill, chalked up the same as ever on a slate, that was doubtless one of the “quaint” features, paid it, shook hands, and went out. “You never come here any more, Monsieur Barnes,” Madame Lecomte said.",0
8491,“Too many compatriots.”  “Come at lunch-time. It’s not crowded then.” “Good. I’ll be down soon.”,0
8492,We walked along under the trees that grew out over the river on the Quai d’Orléans side of the island. Across the river were the broken walls of old houses that were being torn down. “They’re going to cut a street through.”,0
8493,"“They would,” Bill said. We walked on and circled the island. The river was dark and a bateau mouche went by, all bright with lights, going fast and quiet up and out of sight under the bridge. Down the river was Notre Dame squatting against the night sky. We crossed to the left bank of the Seine by the wooden foot-bridge from the Quai de Bethune, and stopped on the bridge and looked down the river at Notre Dame. Standing on the bridge the island looked dark, the houses were high against the sky, and the trees were shadows.",0
8494,"“It’s pretty grand,” Bill said. “God, I love to get back.” We leaned on the wooden rail of the bridge and looked up the river to the lights of the big bridges. Below the water was smooth and black. It made no sound against the piles of the bridge. A man and a girl passed us. They were walking with their arms around each other.",0
8495,"We crossed the bridge and walked up the Rue du Cardinal Lemoine. It was steep walking, and we went all the way up to the Place Contrescarpe. The arc-light shone through the leaves of the trees in the square, and underneath the trees was an S bus ready to start. Music came out of the door of the Negre Joyeux. Through the window of the Café Aux Amateurs I saw the long zinc bar. Outside on the terrace working people were drinking. In the open kitchen of the Amateurs a girl was cooking potato-chips in oil. There was an iron pot of stew. The girl ladled some onto a plate for an old man who stood holding a bottle of red wine in one hand.",0
8496,"“Want to have a drink?”  “No,” said Bill. “I don’t need it.” We turned to the right off the Place Contrescarpe, walking along smooth narrow streets with high old houses on both sides. Some of the houses jutted out toward the street. Others were cut back. We came onto the Rue du Pot de Fer and followed it along until it brought us to the rigid north and south of the Rue Saint Jacques and then walked south, past Val de Grâce, set back behind the courtyard and the iron fence, to the Boulevard du Port Royal.",0
8497,"“What do you want to do?” I asked. “Go up to the café and see Brett and Mike?”  “Why not?”  We walked along Port Royal until it became Montparnasse, and then on past the Lilas, Lavigne’s, and all the little cafés, Damoy’s, crossed the street to the Rotonde, past its lights and tables to the Select.",0
8498,"Michael came toward us from the tables. He was tanned and healthy-looking. “Hel-lo, Jake,” he said. “Hel-lo! Hel-lo! How are you, old lad?”  “You look very fit, Mike.”",0
8499,"“Oh, I am. I’m frightfully fit. I’ve done nothing but walk. Walk all day long. One drink a day with my mother at tea.”",0
8500,"Bill had gone into the bar. He was standing talking with Brett, who was sitting on a high stool, her legs crossed. She had no stockings on.",0
8501,"“It’s good to see you, Jake,” Michael said. “I’m a little tight you know. Amazing, isn’t it? Did you see my nose?”  There was a patch of dried blood on the bridge of his nose.",0
8502,"“An old lady’s bags did that,” Mike said. “I reached up to help her with them and they fell on me.” Brett gestured at him from the bar with her cigarette-holder and wrinkled the corners of her eyes.",0
8503,"“An old lady,” said Mike. “Her bags fell on me. Let’s go in and see Brett. I say, she is a piece. You are a lovely lady, Brett. Where did you get that hat?”  “Chap bought it for me.",0
8504,"Don’t you like it?”  “It’s a dreadful hat. Do get a good hat.” “Oh, we’ve so much money now,” Brett said. “I say, haven’t you met Bill yet? You are a lovely host, Jake.”",0
8505,"She turned to Mike. “This is Bill Gorton. This drunkard is Mike Campbell. Mr. Campbell is an undischarged bankrupt.”  “Aren’t I, though?",0
8506,You know I met my ex-partner yesterday in London. Chap who did me in.” “What did he say?”  “Bought me a drink.,0
8507,"I thought I might as well take it. I say, Brett, you are a lovely piece. Don’t you think she’s beautiful?”  “Beautiful.",0
8508,"With this nose?”  “It’s a lovely nose. Go on, point it at me. Isn’t she a lovely piece?”  “Couldn’t we have kept the man in Scotland?”  “I say, Brett, let’s turn in early.”  “Don’t be indecent, Michael.",0
8509,"Remember there are ladies at this bar.”  “Isn’t she a lovely piece? Don’t you think so, Jake?”  “There’s a fight to-night,” Bill said. “Like to go?”  “Fight,” said Mike.",0
8510,"“Who’s fighting?”  “Ledoux and somebody.” “He’s very good, Ledoux,” Mike said. “I’d like to see it, rather”—he was making an effort to pull himself together—“but I can’t go. I had a date with this thing here. I say, Brett, do get a new hat.”",0
8511,Brett pulled the felt hat down far over one eye and smiled out from under it. “You two run along to the fight. I’ll have to be taking Mr. Campbell home directly.”,0
8512,"“I’m not tight,” Mike said. “Perhaps just a little. I say, Brett, you are a lovely piece.”",0
8513,"“Go on to the fight,” Brett said. “Mr. Campbell’s getting difficult. What are these outbursts of affection, Michael?”  “I say, you are a lovely piece.”",0
8514,"We said good night. “I’m sorry I can’t go,” Mike said. Brett laughed. I looked back from the door. Mike had one hand on the bar and was leaning toward Brett, talking. Brett was looking at him quite coolly, but the corners of her eyes were smiling.",0
8515,"Outside on the pavement I said: “Do you want to go to the fight?”  “Sure,” said Bill. “If we don’t have to walk.” “Mike was pretty excited about his girl friend,” I said in the taxi.",0
8516,"“Well,” said Bill. “You can’t blame him such a hell of a lot.” CHAPTER 9 The Ledoux-Kid Francis fight was the night of the 20th of June. It was a good fight. The morning after the fight I had a letter from Robert Cohn, written from Hendaye. He was having a very quiet time, he said, bathing, playing some golf and much bridge. Hendaye had a splendid beach, but he was anxious to start on the fishing-trip. When would I be down? If I would buy him a double-tapered line he would pay me when I came down.",0
8517,"That same morning I wrote Cohn from the office that Bill and I would leave Paris on the 25th unless I wired him otherwise, and would meet him at Bayonne, where we could get a bus over the mountains to Pamplona. The same evening about seven o’clock I stopped in at the Select to see Michael and Brett. They were not there, and I went over to the Dingo. They were inside sitting at the bar.",0
8518,"“Hello, darling.” Brett put out her hand. “Hello, Jake,” Mike said. “I understand I was tight last night.”  “Weren’t you, though,” Brett said.",0
8519,"“Disgraceful business.”  “Look,” said Mike, “when do you go down to Spain? Would you mind if we came down with you?”  “It would be grand.” “You wouldn’t mind, really? I’ve been at Pamplona, you know. Brett’s mad to go. You’re sure we wouldn’t just be a bloody nuisance?”  “Don’t talk like a fool.”",0
8520,"“I’m a little tight, you know. I wouldn’t ask you like this if I weren’t. You’re sure you don’t mind?”  “Oh, shut up, Michael,” Brett said.",0
8521,"“How can the man say he’d mind now? I’ll ask him later.” “But you don’t mind, do you?”  “Don’t ask that again unless you want to make me sore.",0
8522,"Bill and I go down on the morning of the 25th.” “By the way, where is Bill?” Brett asked.",0
8523,"“He’s out at Chantilly dining with some people.” “He’s a good chap.”  “Splendid chap,” said Mike. “He is, you know.”",0
8524,"“You don’t remember him,” Brett said. “I do. Remember him perfectly. Look, Jake, we’ll come down the night of the 25th. Brett can’t get up in the morning.”",0
8525,"“Indeed not!”  “If our money comes and you’re sure you don’t mind.” “It will come, all right. I’ll see to that.”",0
8526,"“Tell me what tackle to send for.”  “Get two or three rods with reels, and lines, and some flies.” “I won’t fish,” Brett put in. “Get two rods, then, and Bill won’t have to buy one.”",0
8527,"“Right,” said Mike. “I’ll send a wire to the keeper.” “Won’t it be splendid,” Brett said. “Spain! We will have fun.”",0
8528,"“The 25th. When is that?”  “Saturday.”  “We will have to get ready.” “I say,” said Mike, “I’m going to the barber’s.”",0
8529,"“I must bathe,” said Brett. “Walk up to the hotel with me, Jake. Be a good chap.”",0
8530,"“We have got the loveliest hotel,” Mike said. “I think it’s a brothel!” “We left our bags here at the Dingo when we got in, and they asked us at this hotel if we wanted a room for the afternoon only. Seemed frightfully pleased we were going to stay all night.”",0
8531,"“I believe it’s a brothel,” Mike said. “And I should know.” “Oh, shut it and go and get your hair cut.”",0
8532,"Mike went out. Brett and I sat on at the bar. “Have another?”  “Might.”  “I needed that,” Brett said.",0
8533,"We walked up the Rue Delambre. “I haven’t seen you since I’ve been back,” Brett said. “No.”  “How are you, Jake?”  “Fine.”  Brett looked at me.",0
8534,"“I say,” she said, “is Robert Cohn going on this trip?”  “Yes. Why?”  “Don’t you think it will be a bit rough on him?”  “Why should it?”  “Who did you think I went down to San Sebastian with?”  “Congratulations,” I said. We walked along.",0
8535,"“What did you say that for?”  “I don’t know. What would you like me to say?”  We walked along and turned a corner. “He behaved rather well, too. He gets a little dull.”",0
8536,"“Does he?”  “I rather thought it would be good for him.” “You might take up social service.”  “Don’t be nasty.” “I won’t.”  “Didn’t you really know?”  “No,” I said.",0
8537,"“I guess I didn’t think about it.” “Do you think it will be too rough on him?”  “That’s up to him,” I said. “Tell him you’re coming. He can always not come.”  “I’ll write him and give him a chance to pull out of it.”",0
8538,I did not see Brett again until the night of the 24th of June. “Did you hear from Cohn?”  “Rather. He’s keen about it.”,0
8539,“My God!”  “I thought it was rather odd myself.” “Says he can’t wait to see me.” “Does he think you’re coming alone?”  “No.,0
8540,"I told him we were all coming down together. Michael and all.”  “He’s wonderful.”  “Isn’t he?”  They expected their money the next day. We arranged to meet at Pamplona. They would go directly to San Sebastian and take the train from there. We would all meet at the Montoya in Pamplona. If they did not turn up on Monday at the latest we would go on ahead up to Burguete in the mountains, to start fishing. There was a bus to Burguete. I wrote out an itinerary so they could follow us.",0
8541,"Bill and I took the morning train from the Gare d’Orsay. It was a lovely day, not too hot, and the country was beautiful from the start. We went back into the diner and had breakfast. Leaving the dining-car I asked the conductor for tickets for the first service.",0
8542,"“Nothing until the fifth.”  “What’s this?”  There were never more than two servings of lunch on that train, and always plenty of places for both of them. “They’re all reserved,” the dining-car conductor said. “There will be a fifth service at three-thirty.”",0
8543,"“This is serious,” I said to Bill. “Give him ten francs.” “Here,” I said. “We want to eat in the first service.”",0
8544,"The conductor put the ten francs in his pocket. “Thank you,” he said. “I would advise you gentlemen to get some sandwiches. All the places for the first four services were reserved at the office of the company.”",0
8545,"“You’ll go a long way, brother,” Bill said to him in English. “I suppose if I’d given you five francs you would have advised us to jump off the train.”  “Comment?”  “Go to hell!” said Bill. “Get the sandwiches made and a bottle of wine. You tell him, Jake.”  “And send it up to the next car.”",0
8546,"I described where we were. In our compartment were a man and his wife and their young son. “I suppose you’re Americans, aren’t you?” the man asked. “Having a good trip?”  “Wonderful,” said Bill.",0
8547,"“That’s what you want to do. Travel while you’re young. Mother and I always wanted to get over, but we had to wait a while.”",0
8548,"“You could have come over ten years ago, if you’d wanted to,” the wife said. “What you always said was: ‘See America first!’ I will say we’ve seen a good deal, take it one way and another.”  “Say, there’s plenty of Americans on this train,” the husband said.",0
8549,"“They’ve got seven cars of them from Dayton, Ohio. They’ve been on a pilgrimage to Rome, and now they’re going down to Biarritz and Lourdes.” “So, that’s what they are. Pilgrims. Goddam Puritans,” Bill said.",0
8550,"“What part of the States you boys from?”  “Kansas City,” I said. “He’s from Chicago.” “You both going to Biarritz?”  “No.",0
8551,"We’re going fishing in Spain.” “Well, I never cared for it, myself. There’s plenty that do out where I come from, though. We got some of the best fishing in the State of Montana. I’ve been out with the boys, but I never cared for it any.”",0
8552,"“Mighty little fishing you did on them trips,” his wife said. He winked at us. “You know how the ladies are. If there’s a jug goes along, or a case of beer, they think it’s hell and damnation.”",0
8553,"“That’s the way men are,” his wife said to us. She smoothed her comfortable lap. “I voted against prohibition to please him, and because I like a little beer in the house, and then he talks that way. It’s a wonder they ever find any one to marry them.”  “Say,” said Bill, “do you know that gang of Pilgrim Fathers have cornered the dining-car until half past three this afternoon?”  “How do you mean?",0
8554,"They can’t do a thing like that.” “You try and get seats.” “Well, mother, it looks as though we better go back and get another breakfast.”",0
8555,"She stood up and straightened her dress. “Will you boys keep an eye on our things? Come on, Hubert.”",0
8556,"They all three went up to the wagon restaurant. A little while after they were gone a steward went through announcing the first service, and pilgrims, with their priests, commenced filing down the corridor. Our friend and his family did not come back. A waiter passed in the corridor with our sandwiches and the bottle of Chablis, and we called him in.",0
8557,"“You’re going to work to-day,” I said. He nodded his head. “They start now, at ten-thirty.”",0
8558,"“When do we eat?”  “Huh! When do I eat?”  He left two glasses for the bottle, and we paid him for the sandwiches and tipped him. “I’ll get the plates,” he said, “or bring them with you.”",0
8559,"We ate the sandwiches and drank the Chablis and watched the country out of the window. The grain was just beginning to ripen and the fields were full of poppies. The pastureland was green, and there were fine trees, and sometimes big rivers and chateaux off in the trees.",0
8560,"At Tours we got off and bought another bottle of wine, and when we got back in the compartment the gentleman from Montana and his wife and his son, Hubert, were sitting comfortably. “Is there good swimming in Biarritz?” asked Hubert.",0
8561,"“That boy’s just crazy till he can get in the water,” his mother said. “It’s pretty hard on youngsters travelling.” “There’s good swimming,” I said. “But it’s dangerous when it’s rough.”  “Did you get a meal?”",0
8562,"Bill asked. “We sure did. We set right there when they started to come in, and they must have just thought we were in the party. One of the waiters said something to us in French, and then they just sent three of them back.”",0
8563,"“They thought we were snappers, all right,” the man said. “It certainly shows you the power of the Catholic Church. It’s a pity you boys ain’t Catholics. You could get a meal, then, all right.”",0
8564,"“I am,” I said. “That’s what makes me so sore.” Finally at a quarter past four we had lunch. Bill had been rather difficult at the last. He buttonholed a priest who was coming back with one of the returning streams of pilgrims.",0
8565,"“When do us Protestants get a chance to eat, father?”  “I don’t know anything about it. Haven’t you got tickets?”  “It’s enough to make a man join the Klan,” Bill said. The priest looked back at him.",0
8566,Inside the dining-car the waiters served the fifth successive table d’hôte meal. The waiter who served us was soaked through. His white jacket was purple under the arms.,0
8567,“He must drink a lot of wine.”  “Or wear purple undershirts.” “Let’s ask him.”  “No. He’s too tired.”,0
8568,"The train stopped for half an hour at Bordeaux and we went out through the station for a little walk. There was not time to get in to the town. Afterward we passed through the Landes and watched the sun set. There were wide fire-gaps cut through the pines, and you could look up them like avenues and see wooded hills way off. About seven-thirty we had dinner and watched the country through the open window in the diner. It was all sandy pine country full of heather. There were little clearings with houses in them, and once in a while we passed a sawmill. It got dark and we could feel the country hot and sandy and dark outside of the window, and about nine o’clock we got into Bayonne. The man and his wife and Hubert all shook hands with us. They were going on to LaNegresse to change for Biarritz.",0
8569,"“Well, I hope you have lots of luck,” he said. “Be careful about those bull-fights.” “Maybe we’ll see you at Biarritz,” Hubert said.",0
8570,"We got off with our bags and rod-cases and passed through the dark station and out to the lights and the line of cabs and hotel buses. There, standing with the hotel runners, was Robert Cohn. He did not see us at first. Then he started forward.",0
8571,"“Hello, Jake. Have a good trip?”  “Fine,” I said. “This is Bill Gorton.” “How are you?”  “Come on,” said Robert.",0
8572,"“I’ve got a cab.” He was a little near-sighted. I had never noticed it before. He was looking at Bill, trying to make him out. He was shy, too.",0
8573,“We’ll go up to my hotel. It’s all right. It’s quite nice.”,0
8574,"We got into the cab, and the cabman put the bags up on the seat beside him and climbed up and cracked his whip, and we drove over the dark bridge and into the town. “I’m awfully glad to meet you,” Robert said to Bill. “I’ve heard so much about you from Jake and I’ve read your books. Did you get my line, Jake?”  The cab stopped in front of the hotel and we all got out and went in.",0
8575,"It was a nice hotel, and the people at the desk were very cheerful, and we each had a good small room. CHAPTER 10 In the morning it was bright, and they were sprinkling the streets of the town, and we all had breakfast in a café. Bayonne is a nice town. It is like a very clean Spanish town and it is on a big river. Already, so early in the morning, it was very hot on the bridge across the river. We walked out on the bridge and then took a walk through the town.",0
8576,"I was not at all sure Mike’s rods would come from Scotland in time, so we hunted a tackle store and finally bought a rod for Bill up-stairs over a drygoods store. The man who sold the tackle was out, and we had to wait for him to come back. Finally he came in, and we bought a pretty good rod cheap, and two landing-nets.",0
8577,"We went out into the street again and took a look at the cathedral. Cohn made some remark about it being a very good example of something or other, I forget what. It seemed like a nice cathedral, nice and dim, like Spanish churches. Then we went up past the old fort and out to the local Syndicat d’Initiative office, where the bus was supposed to start from. There they told us the bus service did not start until the 1st of July. We found out at the tourist office what we ought to pay for a motor-car to Pamplona and hired one at a big garage just around the corner from the Municipal Theatre for four hundred francs. The car was to pick us up at the hotel in forty minutes, and we stopped at the café on the square where we had eaten breakfast, and had a beer. It was hot, but the town had a cool, fresh, early-morning smell and it was pleasant sitting in the café. A breeze started to blow, and you could feel that the air came from the sea. There were pigeons out in the square, and the houses were a yellow, sun-baked color, and I did not want to leave the café. But we had to go to the hotel to get our bags packed and pay the bill. We paid for the beers, we matched and I think Cohn paid, and went up to the hotel. It was only sixteen francs apiece for Bill and me, with ten per cent added for the service, and we had the bags sent down and waited for Robert Cohn. While we were waiting I saw a cockroach on the parquet floor that must have been at least three inches long. I pointed him out to Bill and then put my shoe on him. We agreed he must have just come in from the garden. It was really an awfully clean hotel.",0
8578,"Cohn came down, finally, and we all went out to the car. It was a big, closed car, with a driver in a white duster with blue collar and cuffs, and we had him put the back of the car down. He piled in the bags and we started off up the street and out of the town. We passed some lovely gardens and had a good look back at the town, and then we were out in the country, green and rolling, and the road climbing all the time. We passed lots of Basques with oxen, or cattle, hauling carts along the road, and nice farmhouses, low roofs, and all white-plastered. In the Basque country the land all looks very rich and green and the houses and villages look well-off and clean. Every village had a pelota court and on some of them kids were playing in the hot sun. There were signs on the walls of the churches saying it was forbidden to play pelota against them, and the houses in the villages had red tiled roofs, and then the road turned off and commenced to climb and we were going way up close along a hillside, with a valley below and hills stretched off back toward the sea. You couldn’t see the sea. It was too far away. You could see only hills and more hills, and you knew where the sea was.",0
8579,"We crossed the Spanish frontier. There was a little stream and a bridge, and Spanish carabineers, with patent-leather Bonaparte hats, and short guns on their backs, on one side, and on the other fat Frenchmen in kepis and mustaches. They only opened one bag and took the passports in and looked at them. There was a general store and inn on each side of the line. The chauffeur had to go in and fill out some papers about the car and we got out and went over to the stream to see if there were any trout. Bill tried to talk some Spanish to one of the carabineers, but it did not go very well. Robert Cohn asked, pointing with his finger, if there were any trout in the stream, and the carabineer said yes, but not many.",0
8580,"I asked him if he ever fished, and he said no, that he didn’t care for it. Just then an old man with long, sunburned hair and beard, and clothes that looked as though they were made of gunny-sacking, came striding up to the bridge. He was carrying a long staff, and he had a kid slung on his back, tied by the four legs, the head hanging down.",0
8581,"The carabineer waved him back with his sword. The man turned without saying anything, and started back up the white road into Spain. “What’s the matter with the old one?” I asked.",0
8582,“He hasn’t got any passport.” I offered the guard a cigarette. He took it and thanked me.,0
8583,“What will he do?” I asked. The guard spat in the dust.,0
8584,"“Oh, he’ll just wade across the stream.” “Do you have much smuggling?”  “Oh,” he said, “they go through.” The chauffeur came out, folding up the papers and putting them in the inside pocket of his coat. We all got in the car and it started up the white dusty road into Spain. For a while the country was much as it had been; then, climbing all the time, we crossed the top of a Col, the road winding back and forth on itself, and then it was really Spain. There were long brown mountains and a few pines and far-off forests of beech-trees on some of the mountainsides. The road went along the summit of the Col and then dropped down, and the driver had to honk, and slow up, and turn out to avoid running into two donkeys that were sleeping in the road. We came down out of the mountains and through an oak forest, and there were white cattle grazing in the forest. Down below there were grassy plains and clear streams, and then we crossed a stream and went through a gloomy little village, and started to climb again. We climbed up and up and crossed another high Col and turned along it, and the road ran down to the right, and we saw a whole new range of mountains off to the south, all brown and baked-looking and furrowed in strange shapes.",0
8585,"After a while we came out of the mountains, and there were trees along both sides of the road, and a stream and ripe fields of grain, and the road went on, very white and straight ahead, and then lifted to a little rise, and off on the left was a hill with an old castle, with buildings close around it and a field of grain going right up to the walls and shifting in the wind. I was up in front with the driver and I turned around. Robert Cohn was asleep, but Bill looked and nodded his head. Then we crossed a wide plain, and there was a big river off on the right shining in the sun from between the line of trees, and away off you could see the plateau of Pamplona rising out of the plain, and the walls of the city, and the great brown cathedral, and the broken skyline of the other churches. In back of the plateau were the mountains, and every way you looked there were other mountains, and ahead the road stretched out white across the plain going toward Pamplona.",0
8586,"We came into the town on the other side of the plateau, the road slanting up steeply and dustily with shade-trees on both sides, and then levelling out through the new part of town they are building up outside the old walls. We passed the bull-ring, high and white and concrete-looking in the sun, and then came into the big square by a side street and stopped in front of the Hotel Montoya. The driver helped us down with the bags. There was a crowd of kids watching the car, and the square was hot, and the trees were green, and the flags hung on their staffs, and it was good to get out of the sun and under the shade of the arcade that runs all the way around the square. Montoya was glad to see us, and shook hands and gave us good rooms looking out on the square, and then we washed and cleaned up and went down-stairs in the dining-room for lunch. The driver stayed for lunch, too, and afterward we paid him and he started back to Bayonne.",0
8587,"There are two dining-rooms in the Montoya. One is up-stairs on the second floor and looks out on the square. The other is down one floor below the level of the square and has a door that opens on the back street that the bulls pass along when they run through the streets early in the morning on their way to the ring. It is always cool in the down-stairs dining-room and we had a very good lunch. The first meal in Spain was always a shock with the hors d’œuvres, an egg course, two meat courses, vegetables, salad, and dessert and fruit. You have to drink plenty of wine to get it all down. Robert Cohn tried to say he did not want any of the second meat course, but we would not interpret for him, and so the waitress brought him something else as a replacement, a plate of cold meats, I think. Cohn had been rather nervous ever since we had met at Bayonne. He did not know whether we knew Brett had been with him at San Sebastian, and it made him rather awkward.",0
8588,"“Well,” I said, “Brett and Mike ought to get in to-night.” “I’m not sure they’ll come,” Cohn said. “Why not?” Bill said. “Of course they’ll come.”",0
8589,"“They’re always late,” I said. “I rather think they’re not coming,” Robert Cohn said. He said it with an air of superior knowledge that irritated both of us.",0
8590,"“I’ll bet you fifty pesetas they’re here to-night,” Bill said. He always bets when he is angered, and so he usually bets foolishly. “I’ll take it,” Cohn said. “Good. You remember it, Jake. Fifty pesetas.”  “I’ll remember it myself,” Bill said.",0
8591,"I saw he was angry and wanted to smooth him down. “It’s a sure thing they’ll come,” I said. “But maybe not to-night.”  “Want to call it off?”",0
8592,Cohn asked. “No. Why should I? Make it a hundred if you like.”,0
8593,"“All right. I’ll take that.” “That’s enough,” I said. “Or you’ll have to make a book and give me some of it.”",0
8594,"“I’m satisfied,” Cohn said. He smiled. “You’ll probably win it back at bridge, anyway.”",0
8595,"“You haven’t got it yet,” Bill said. We went out to walk around under the arcade to the Café Iruña for coffee. Cohn said he was going over and get a shave.",0
8596,"“Say,” Bill said to me, “have I got any chance on that bet?”  “You’ve got a rotten chance. They’ve never been on time anywhere. If their money doesn’t come it’s a cinch they won’t get in to-night.”",0
8597,"“I was sorry as soon as I opened my mouth. But I had to call him. He’s all right, I guess, but where does he get this inside stuff? Mike and Brett fixed it up with us about coming down here.”",0
8598,"I saw Cohn coming over across the square. “Here he comes.” “Well, let him not get superior and Jewish.”",0
8599,"“The barber shop’s closed,” Cohn said. “It’s not open till four.” We had coffee at the Iruña, sitting in comfortable wicker chairs looking out from the cool of the arcade at the big square. After a while Bill went to write some letters and Cohn went over to the barber-shop. It was still closed, so he decided to go up to the hotel and get a bath, and I sat out in front of the café and then went for a walk in the town. It was very hot, but I kept on the shady side of the streets and went through the market and had a good time seeing the town again. I went to the Ayuntamiento and found the old gentleman who subscribes for the bull-fight tickets for me every year, and he had gotten the money I sent him from Paris and renewed my subscriptions, so that was all set. He was the archivist, and all the archives of the town were in his office. That has nothing to do with the story. Anyway, his office had a green baize door and a big wooden door, and when I went out I left him sitting among the archives that covered all the walls, and I shut both the doors, and as I went out of the building into the street the porter stopped me to brush off my coat.",0
8600,"“You must have been in a motor-car,” he said. The back of the collar and the upper part of the shoulders were gray with dust. “From Bayonne.”  “Well, well,” he said.",0
8601,"“I knew you were in a motor-car from the way the dust was.” So I gave him two copper coins. At the end of the street I saw the cathedral and walked up toward it. The first time I ever saw it I thought the façade was ugly but I liked it now. I went inside. It was dim and dark and the pillars went high up, and there were people praying, and it smelt of incense, and there were some wonderful big windows. I knelt and started to pray and prayed for everybody I thought of, Brett and Mike and Bill and Robert Cohn and myself, and all the bull-fighters, separately for the ones I liked, and lumping all the rest, then I prayed for myself again, and while I was praying for myself I found I was getting sleepy, so I prayed that the bull-fights would be good, and that it would be a fine fiesta, and that we would get some fishing. I wondered if there was anything else I might pray for, and I thought I would like to have some money, so I prayed that I would make a lot of money, and then I started to think how I would make it, and thinking of making money reminded me of the count, and I started wondering about where he was, and regretting I hadn’t seen him since that night in Montmartre, and about something funny Brett told me about him, and as all the time I was kneeling with my forehead on the wood in front of me, and was thinking of myself as praying, I was a little ashamed, and regretted that I was such a rotten Catholic, but realized there was nothing I could do about it, at least for a while, and maybe never, but that anyway it was a grand religion, and I only wished I felt religious and maybe I would the next time; and then I was out in the hot sun on the steps of the cathedral, and the forefingers and the thumb of my right hand were still damp, and I felt them dry in the sun. The sunlight was hot and hard, and I crossed over beside some buildings, and walked back along side-streets to the hotel.",0
8602,"At dinner that night we found that Robert Cohn had taken a bath, had had a shave and a haircut and a shampoo, and something put on his hair afterward to make it stay down. He was nervous, and I did not try to help him any. The train was due in at nine o’clock from San Sebastian, and, if Brett and Mike were coming, they would be on it. At twenty minutes to nine we were not half through dinner. Robert Cohn got up from the table and said he would go to the station. I said I would go with him, just to devil him. Bill said he would be damned if he would leave his dinner. I said we would be right back.",0
8603,"We walked to the station. I was enjoying Cohn’s nervousness. I hoped Brett would be on the train. At the station the train was late, and we sat on a baggage-truck and waited outside in the dark. I have never seen a man in civil life as nervous as Robert Cohn—nor as eager. I was enjoying it. It was lousy to enjoy it, but I felt lousy. Cohn had a wonderful quality of bringing out the worst in anybody.",0
8604,"After a while we heard the train-whistle way off below on the other side of the plateau, and then we saw the headlight coming up the hill. We went inside the station and stood with a crowd of people just back of the gates, and the train came in and stopped, and everybody started coming out through the gates. They were not in the crowd. We waited till everybody had gone through and out of the station and gotten into buses, or taken cabs, or were walking with their friends or relatives through the dark into the town.",0
8605,"“I knew they wouldn’t come,” Robert said. We were going back to the hotel. “I thought they might,” I said.",0
8606,"Bill was eating fruit when we came in and finishing a bottle of wine. “Didn’t come, eh?”  “No.”  “Do you mind if I give you that hundred pesetas in the morning, Cohn?” Bill asked. “I haven’t changed any money here yet.”",0
8607,"“Oh, forget about it,” Robert Cohn said. “Let’s bet on something else. Can you bet on bull-fights?”  “You could,” Bill said, “but you don’t need to.”",0
8608,"“It would be like betting on the war,” I said. “You don’t need any economic interest.” “I’m very curious to see them,” Robert said.",0
8609,Montoya came up to our table. He had a telegram in his hand. “It’s for you.” He handed it to me.,0
8610,"It read: “Stopped night San Sebastian.” “It’s from them,” I said. I put it in my pocket. Ordinarily I should have handed it over.",0
8611,"“They’ve stopped over in San Sebastian,” I said. “Send their regards to you.” Why I felt that impulse to devil him I do not know. Of course I do know. I was blind, unforgivingly jealous of what had happened to him. The fact that I took it as a matter of course did not alter that any. I certainly did hate him. I do not think I ever really hated him until he had that little spell of superiority at lunch—that and when he went through all that barbering. So I put the telegram in my pocket. The telegram came to me, anyway.",0
8612,"“Well,” I said. “We ought to pull out on the noon bus for Burguete. They can follow us if they get in to-morrow night.”",0
8613,"There were only two trains up from San Sebastian, an early morning train and the one we had just met. “That sounds like a good idea,” Cohn said. “The sooner we get on the stream the better.”",0
8614,"“It’s all one to me when we start,” Bill said. “The sooner the better.” We sat in the Iruña for a while and had coffee and then took a little walk out to the bull-ring and across the field and under the trees at the edge of the cliff and looked down at the river in the dark, and I turned in early. Bill and Cohn stayed out in the café quite late, I believe, because I was asleep when they came in.",0
8615,In the morning I bought three tickets for the bus to Burguete. It was scheduled to leave at two o’clock. There was nothing earlier. I was sitting over at the Iruña reading the papers when I saw Robert Cohn coming across the square. He came up to the table and sat down in one of the wicker chairs.,0
8616,"“This is a comfortable café,” he said. “Did you have a good night, Jake?”  “I slept like a log.” “I didn’t sleep very well. Bill and I were out late, too.”",0
8617,“Where were you?”  “Here. And after it shut we went over to that other café. The old man there speaks German and English.”,0
8618,“The Café Suizo.”  “That’s it. He seems like a nice old fellow. I think it’s a better café than this one.”,0
8619,"“It’s not so good in the daytime,” I said. “Too hot. By the way, I got the bus tickets.”",0
8620,“I’m not going up to-day. You and Bill go on ahead.” “I’ve got your ticket.”,0
8621,“Give it to me. I’ll get the money back.” “It’s five pesetas.”,0
8622,"Robert Cohn took out a silver five-peseta piece and gave it to me. “I ought to stay,” he said. “You see I’m afraid there’s some sort of misunderstanding.”",0
8623,"“Why,” I said. “They may not come here for three or four days now if they start on parties at San Sebastian.” “That’s just it,” said Robert. “I’m afraid they expected to meet me at San Sebastian, and that’s why they stopped over.”",0
8624,"“What makes you think that?”  “Well, I wrote suggesting it to Brett.”  “Why in hell didn’t you stay there and meet them then?” I started to say, but I stopped. I thought that idea would come to him by itself, but I do not believe it ever did.",0
8625,"He was being confidential now and it was giving him pleasure to be able to talk with the understanding that I knew there was something between him and Brett. “Well, Bill and I will go up right after lunch,” I said.",0
8626,“I wish I could go. We’ve been looking forward to this fishing all winter.” He was being sentimental about it. “But I ought to stay. I really ought. As soon as they come I’ll bring them right up.”  “Let’s find Bill.”,0
8627,“I want to go over to the barber-shop.”  “See you at lunch.” I found Bill up in his room. He was shaving.,0
8628,"“Oh, yes, he told me all about it last night,” Bill said. “He’s a great little confider. He said he had a date with Brett at San Sebastian.”",0
8629,"“The lying bastard!”  “Oh, no,” said Bill. “Don’t get sore. Don’t get sore at this stage of the trip. How did you ever happen to know this fellow, anyway?”  “Don’t rub it in.”",0
8630,"Bill looked around, half-shaved, and then went on talking into the mirror while he lathered his face. “Didn’t you send him with a letter to me in New York last winter? Thank God, I’m a travelling man. Haven’t you got some more Jewish friends you could bring along?” He rubbed his chin with his thumb, looked at it, and then started scraping again.",0
8631,"“You’ve got some fine ones yourself.” “Oh, yes. I’ve got some darbs. But not alongside of this Robert Cohn. The funny thing is he’s nice, too. I like him. But he’s just so awful.”",0
8632,“He can be damn nice.” “I know it. That’s the terrible part.”  I laughed.,0
8633,"“Yes. Go on and laugh,” said Bill. “You weren’t out with him last night until two o’clock.” “Was he very bad?”  “Awful.",0
8634,"What’s all this about him and Brett, anyway? Did she ever have anything to do with him?”  He raised his chin up and pulled it from side to side. “Sure. She went down to San Sebastian with him.”",0
8635,“What a damn-fool thing to do. Why did she do that?”  “She wanted to get out of town and she can’t go anywhere alone. She said she thought it would be good for him.”,0
8636,"“What bloody-fool things people do. Why didn’t she go off with some of her own people? Or you?”—he slurred that over—“or me? Why not me?” He looked at his face carefully in the glass, put a big dab of lather on each cheek-bone. “It’s an honest face. It’s a face any woman would be safe with.”",0
8637,“She’d never seen it.” “She should have. All women should see it. It’s a face that ought to be thrown on every screen in the country. Every woman ought to be given a copy of this face as she leaves the altar. Mothers should tell their daughters about this face. My son”—he pointed the razor at me—“go west with this face and grow up with the country.”,0
8638,"He ducked down to the bowl, rinsed his face with cold water, put on some alcohol, and then looked at himself carefully in the glass, pulling down his long upper lip. “My God!” he said, “isn’t it an awful face?”  He looked in the glass.",0
8639,"“And as for this Robert Cohn,” Bill said, “he makes me sick, and he can go to hell, and I’m damn glad he’s staying here so we won’t have him fishing with us.” “You’re damn right.” “We’re going trout-fishing. We’re going trout-fishing in the Irati River, and we’re going to get tight now at lunch on the wine of the country, and then take a swell bus ride.”  “Come on.",0
8640,"Let’s go over to the Iruña and start,” I said. CHAPTER 11 It was baking hot in the square when we came out after lunch with our bags and the rod-case to go to Burguete. People were on top of the bus, and others were climbing up a ladder. Bill went up and Robert sat beside Bill to save a place for me, and I went back in the hotel to get a couple of bottles of wine to take with us. When I came out the bus was crowded. Men and women were sitting on all the baggage and boxes on top, and the women all had their fans going in the sun. It certainly was hot. Robert climbed down and I fitted into the place he had saved on the one wooden seat that ran across the top.",0
8641,"Robert Cohn stood in the shade of the arcade waiting for us start. A Basque with a big leather wine-bag in his lap lay across the top of the bus in front of our seat, leaning back against our legs. He offered the wine-skin to Bill and to me, and when I tipped it up to drink he imitated the sound of a klaxon motor-horn so well and so suddenly that I spilled some of the wine, and everybody laughed. He apologized and made me take another drink. He made the klaxon again a little later, and it fooled me the second time. He was very good at it. The Basques liked it. The man next to Bill was talking to him in Spanish and Bill was not getting it, so he offered the man one of the bottles of wine. The man waved it away. He said it was too hot and he had drunk too much at lunch. When Bill offered the bottle the second time he took a long drink, and then the bottle went all over that part of the bus. Every one took a drink very politely, and then they made us cork it up and put it away. They all wanted us to drink from their leather wine-bottles. They were peasants going up into the hills.",0
8642,"Finally, after a couple more false klaxons, the bus started, and Robert Cohn waved good-by to us, and all the Basques waved good-by to him. As soon as we started out on the road outside of town it was cool. It felt nice riding high up and close under the trees. The bus went quite fast and made a good breeze, and as we went out along the road with the dust powdering the trees and down the hill, we had a fine view, back through the trees, of the town rising up from the bluff above the river. The Basque lying against my knees pointed out the view with the neck of the wine-bottle, and winked at us. He nodded his head.",0
8643,"“Pretty nice, eh?”  “These Basques are swell people,” Bill said. The Basque lying against my legs was tanned the color of saddle-leather. He wore a black smock like all the rest. There were wrinkles in his tanned neck. He turned around and offered his wine-bag to Bill. Bill handed him one of our bottles. The Basque wagged a forefinger at him and handed the bottle back, slapping in the cork with the palm of his hand. He shoved the wine-bag up.",0
8644,“Arriba! Arriba!” he said. “Lift it up.”,0
8645,"Bill raised the wine-skin and let the stream of wine spurt out and into his mouth, his head tipped back. When he stopped drinking and tipped the leather bottle down a few drops ran down his chin. “No! No!” several Basques said. “Not like that.” One snatched the bottle away from the owner, who was himself about to give a demonstration. He was a young fellow and he held the wine-bottle at full arms’ length and raised it high up, squeezing the leather bag with his hand so the stream of wine hissed into his mouth. He held the bag out there, the wine making a flat, hard trajectory into his mouth, and he kept on swallowing smoothly and regularly.",0
8646,“Hey!” the owner of the bottle shouted. “Whose wine is that?”  The drinker waggled his little finger at him and smiled at us with his eyes.,0
8647,"Then he bit the stream off sharp, made a quick lift with the wine-bag and lowered it down to the owner. He winked at us. The owner shook the wine-skin sadly.",0
8648,"We passed through a town and stopped in front of the posada, and the driver took on several packages. Then we started on again, and outside the town the road commenced to mount. We were going through farming country with rocky hills that sloped down into the fields. The grain-fields went up the hillsides. Now as we went higher there was a wind blowing the grain. The road was white and dusty, and the dust rose under the wheels and hung in the air behind us. The road climbed up into the hills and left the rich grain-fields below. Now there were only patches of grain on the bare hillsides and on each side of the water-courses. We turned sharply out to the side of the road to give room to pass to a long string of six mules, following one after the other, hauling a high-hooded wagon loaded with freight. The wagon and the mules were covered with dust. Close behind was another string of mules and another wagon. This was loaded with lumber, and the arriero driving the mules leaned back and put on the thick wooden brakes as we passed. Up here the country was quite barren and the hills were rocky and hard-baked clay furrowed by the rain.",0
8649,"We came around a curve into a town, and on both sides opened out a sudden green valley. A stream went through the centre of the town and fields of grapes touched the houses. The bus stopped in front of a posada and many of the passengers got down, and a lot of the baggage was unstrapped from the roof from under the big tarpaulins and lifted down. Bill and I got down and went into the posada. There was a low, dark room with saddles and harness, and hay-forks made of white wood, and clusters of canvas rope-soled shoes and hams and slabs of bacon and white garlics and long sausages hanging from the roof. It was cool and dusky, and we stood in front of a long wooden counter with two women behind it serving drinks. Behind them were shelves stacked with supplies and goods.",0
8650,"We each had an aguardiente and paid forty centimes for the two drinks. I gave the woman fifty centimes to make a tip, and she gave me back the copper piece, thinking I had misunderstood the price. Two of our Basques came in and insisted on buying a drink. So they bought a drink and then we bought a drink, and then they slapped us on the back and bought another drink. Then we bought, and then we all went out into the sunlight and the heat, and climbed back on top of the bus. There was plenty of room now for every one to sit on the seat, and the Basque who had been lying on the tin roof now sat between us. The woman who had been serving drinks came out wiping her hands on her apron and talked to somebody inside the bus. Then the driver came out swinging two flat leather mail-pouches and climbed up, and everybody waving we started off.",0
8651,"The road left the green valley at once, and we were up in the hills again. Bill and the wine-bottle Basque were having a conversation. A man leaned over from the other side of the seat and asked in English: “You’re Americans?”  “Sure.”  “I been there,” he said.",0
8652,"“Forty years ago.”  He was an old man, as brown as the others, with the stubble of a white beard. “How was it?”  “What you say?”  “How was America?”  “Oh, I was in California. It was fine.”",0
8653,“Why did you leave?”  “What you say?”  “Why did you come back here?”  “Oh! I come back to get married. I was going to go back but my wife she don’t like to travel. Where you from?”  “Kansas City.”,0
8654,"“I been there,” he said. “I been in Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Denver, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City.” He named them carefully.",0
8655,"“How long were you over?”  “Fifteen years. Then I come back and got married.”  “Have a drink?”  “All right,” he said. “You can’t get this in America, eh?”  “There’s plenty if you can pay for it.”",0
8656,"“What you come over here for?”  “We’re going to the fiesta at Pamplona.” “You like the bull-fights?”  “Sure. Don’t you?”  “Yes,” he said. “I guess I like them.”",0
8657,"Then after a little:  “Where you go now?”  “Up to Burguete to fish.” “Well,” he said, “I hope you catch something.” He shook hands and turned around to the back seat again. The other Basques had been impressed. He sat back comfortably and smiled at me when I turned around to look at the country. But the effort of talking American seemed to have tired him. He did not say anything after that.",0
8658,"The bus climbed steadily up the road. The country was barren and rocks stuck up through the clay. There was no grass beside the road. Looking back we could see the country spread out below. Far back the fields were squares of green and brown on the hillsides. Making the horizon were the brown mountains. They were strangely shaped. As we climbed higher the horizon kept changing. As the bus ground slowly up the road we could see other mountains coming up in the south. Then the road came over the crest, flattened out, and went into a forest. It was a forest of cork oaks, and the sun came through the trees in patches, and there were cattle grazing back in the trees. We went through the forest and the road came out and turned along a rise of land, and out ahead of us was a rolling green plain, with dark mountains beyond it. These were not like the brown, heat-baked mountains we had left behind. These were wooded and there were clouds coming down from them. The green plain stretched off. It was cut by fences and the white of the road showed through the trunks of a double line of trees that crossed the plain toward the north. As we came to the edge of the rise we saw the red roofs and white houses of Burguete ahead strung out on the plain, and away off on the shoulder of the first dark mountain was the gray metal-sheathed roof of the monastery of Roncesvalles.",0
8659,"“There’s Roncevaux,” I said. “Where?”  “Way off there where the mountain starts.” “It’s cold up here,” Bill said.",0
8660,"“It’s high,” I said. “It must be twelve hundred metres.” “It’s awful cold,” Bill said.",0
8661,"The bus levelled down onto the straight line of road that ran to Burguete. We passed a crossroads and crossed a bridge over a stream. The houses of Burguete were along both sides of the road. There were no side-streets. We passed the church and the school-yard, and the bus stopped. We got down and the driver handed down our bags and the rod-case. A carabineer in his cocked hat and yellow leather cross-straps came up.",0
8662,“What’s in there?” he pointed to the rod-case. I opened it and showed him. He asked to see our fishing permits and I got them out. He looked at the date and then waved us on.,0
8663,“Is that all right?” I asked. “Yes. Of course.”,0
8664,"We went up the street, past the whitewashed stone houses, families sitting in their doorways watching us, to the inn. The fat woman who ran the inn came out from the kitchen and shook hands with us. She took off her spectacles, wiped them, and put them on again. It was cold in the inn and the wind was starting to blow outside. The woman sent a girl up-stairs with us to show the room. There were two beds, a washstand, a clothes-chest, and a big, framed steel-engraving of Nuestra Señora de Roncesvalles. The wind was blowing against the shutters. The room was on the north side of the inn. We washed, put on sweaters, and came down-stairs into the dining-room. It had a stone floor, low ceiling, and was oak-panelled. The shutters were up and it was so cold you could see your breath.",0
8665,“My God!” said Bill. “It can’t be this cold to-morrow. I’m not going to wade a stream in this weather.”,0
8666,"There was an upright piano in the far corner of the room beyond the wooden tables and Bill went over and started to play. “I got to keep warm,” he said. I went out to find the woman and ask her how much the room and board was. She put her hands under her apron and looked away from me.",0
8667,"“Twelve pesetas.”  “Why, we only paid that in Pamplona.” She did not say anything, just took off her glasses and wiped them on her apron. “That’s too much,” I said. “We didn’t pay more than that at a big hotel.”",0
8668,"“We’ve put in a bathroom.”  “Haven’t you got anything cheaper?”  “Not in the summer. Now is the big season.” We were the only people in the inn. Well, I thought, it’s only a few days.",0
8669,"“Is the wine included?”  “Oh, yes.”  “Well,” I said. “It’s all right.” I went back to Bill. He blew his breath at me to show how cold it was, and went on playing. I sat at one of the tables and looked at the pictures on the wall. There was one panel of rabbits, dead, one of pheasants, also dead, and one panel of dead ducks. The panels were all dark and smoky-looking. There was a cupboard full of liqueur bottles. I looked at them all. Bill was still playing. “How about a hot rum punch?” he said. “This isn’t going to keep me warm permanently.”",0
8670,"I went out and told the woman what a rum punch was and how to make it. In a few minutes a girl brought a stone pitcher, steaming, into the room. Bill came over from the piano and we drank the hot punch and listened to the wind.",0
8671,"“There isn’t too much rum in that.” I went over to the cupboard and brought the rum bottle and poured a half-tumblerful into the pitcher. “Direct action,” said Bill. “It beats legislation.”",0
8672,"The girl came in and laid the table for supper. “It blows like hell up here,” Bill said. The girl brought in a big bowl of hot vegetable soup and the wine. We had fried trout afterward and some sort of a stew and a big bowl full of wild strawberries. We did not lose money on the wine, and the girl was shy but nice about bringing it. The old woman looked in once and counted the empty bottles.",0
8673,After supper we went up-stairs and smoked and read in bed to keep warm. Once in the night I woke and heard the wind blowing. It felt good to be warm and in bed.,0
8674,"CHAPTER 12 When I woke in the morning I went to the window and looked out. It had cleared and there were no clouds on the mountains. Outside under the window were some carts and an old diligence, the wood of the roof cracked and split by the weather. It must have been left from the days before the motor-buses. A goat hopped up on one of the carts and then to the roof of the diligence. He jerked his head at the other goats below and when I waved at him he bounded down.",0
8675,"Bill was still sleeping, so I dressed, put on my shoes outside in the hall, and went down-stairs. No one was stirring down-stairs, so I unbolted the door and went out. It was cool outside in the early morning and the sun had not yet dried the dew that had come when the wind died down. I hunted around in the shed behind the inn and found a sort of mattock, and went down toward the stream to try and dig some worms for bait. The stream was clear and shallow but it did not look trouty. On the grassy bank where it was damp I drove the mattock into the earth and loosened a chunk of sod. There were worms underneath. They slid out of sight as I lifted the sod and I dug carefully and got a good many. Digging at the edge of the damp ground I filled two empty tobacco-tins with worms and sifted dirt onto them. The goats watched me dig.",0
8676,"When I went back into the inn the woman was down in the kitchen, and I asked her to get coffee for us, and that we wanted a lunch. Bill was awake and sitting on the edge of the bed. “I saw you out of the window,” he said. “Didn’t want to interrupt you. What were you doing? Burying your money?”  “You lazy bum!”  “Been working for the common good?",0
8677,"Splendid. I want you to do that every morning.”  “Come on,” I said. “Get up.”  “What?",0
8678,Get up? I never get up.” He climbed into bed and pulled the sheet up to his chin.,0
8679,“Try and argue me into getting up.” I went on looking for the tackle and putting it all together in the tackle-bag. “Aren’t you interested?” Bill asked.,0
8680,“I’m going down and eat.”  “Eat? Why didn’t you say eat? I thought you just wanted me to get up for fun. Eat? Fine. Now you’re reasonable. You go out and dig some more worms and I’ll be right down.”,0
8681,"“Oh, go to hell!” “Work for the good of all.” Bill stepped into his underclothes. “Show irony and pity.”",0
8682,"I started out of the room with the tackle-bag, the nets, and the rod-case. “Hey! come back!” I put my head in the door.",0
8683,"“Aren’t you going to show a little irony and pity?”  I thumbed my nose. “That’s not irony.” As I went down-stairs I heard Bill singing, “Irony and Pity. When you’re feeling . . . Oh, Give them Irony and Give them Pity. Oh, give them Irony. When they’re feeling . . . Just a little irony. Just a little pity . . .” He kept on singing until he came down-stairs. The tune was: “The Bells are Ringing for Me and my Gal.” I was reading a week-old Spanish paper.",0
8684,“What’s all this irony and pity?”  “What? Don’t you know about Irony and Pity?”  “No. Who got it up?”  “Everybody.,0
8685,"They’re mad about it in New York. It’s just like the Fratellinis used to be.” The girl came in with the coffee and buttered toast. Or, rather, it was bread toasted and buttered.",0
8686,"“Ask her if she’s got any jam,” Bill said. “Be ironical with her.”  “Have you got any jam?”  “That’s not ironical. I wish I could talk Spanish.”",0
8687,The coffee was good and we drank it out of big bowls. The girl brought in a glass dish of raspberry jam. “Thank you.”,0
8688,"“Hey! that’s not the way,” Bill said. “Say something ironical. Make some crack about Primo de Rivera.”",0
8689,"“I could ask her what kind of a jam they think they’ve gotten into in the Riff.”  “Poor,” said Bill. “Very poor. You can’t do it. That’s all. You don’t understand irony. You have no pity. Say something pitiful.”",0
8690,“Robert Cohn.”  “Not so bad. That’s better. Now why is Cohn pitiful? Be ironic.”,0
8691,"He took a big gulp of coffee. “Aw, hell!” I said. “It’s too early in the morning.”",0
8692,"“There you go. And you claim you want to be a writer, too. You’re only a newspaper man. An expatriated newspaper man. You ought to be ironical the minute you get out of bed. You ought to wake up with your mouth full of pity.”  “Go on,” I said.",0
8693,"“Who did you get this stuff from?”  “Everybody. Don’t you read? Don’t you ever see anybody? You know what you are? You’re an expatriate. Why don’t you live in New York? Then you’d know these things. What do you want me to do? Come over here and tell you every year?”  “Take some more coffee,” I said.",0
8694,"“Good. Coffee is good for you. It’s the caffeine in it. Caffeine, we are here. Caffeine puts a man on her horse and a woman in his grave. You know what’s the trouble with you? You’re an expatriate. One of the worst type. Haven’t you heard that? Nobody that ever left their own country ever wrote anything worth printing. Not even in the newspapers.”",0
8695,"He drank the coffee. “You’re an expatriate. You’ve lost touch with the soil. You get precious. Fake European standards have ruined you. You drink yourself to death. You become obsessed by sex. You spend all your time talking, not working. You are an expatriate, see? You hang around cafés.”",0
8696,"“It sounds like a swell life,” I said. “When do I work?”  “You don’t work. One group claims women support you. Another group claims you’re impotent.”",0
8697,"“No,” I said. “I just had an accident.” “Never mention that,” Bill said. “That’s the sort of thing that can’t be spoken of. That’s what you ought to work up into a mystery. Like Henry’s bicycle.”",0
8698,"He had been going splendidly, but he stopped. I was afraid he thought he had hurt me with that crack about being impotent. I wanted to start him again.",0
8699,"“It wasn’t a bicycle,” I said. “He was riding horseback.” “I heard it was a tricycle.”",0
8700,"“Well,” I said. “A plane is sort of like a tricycle. The joystick works the same way.”",0
8701,"“But you don’t pedal it.” “No,” I said, “I guess you don’t pedal it.”  “Let’s lay off that,” Bill said. “All right. I was just standing up for the tricycle.”",0
8702,"“I think he’s a good writer, too,” Bill said. “And you’re a hell of a good guy. Anybody ever tell you you were a good guy?”  “I’m not a good guy.”  “Listen.",0
8703,"You’re a hell of a good guy, and I’m fonder of you than anybody on earth. I couldn’t tell you that in New York. It’d mean I was a faggot. That was what the Civil War was about. Abraham Lincoln was a faggot. He was in love with General Grant. So was Jefferson Davis. Lincoln just freed the slaves on a bet. The Dred Scott case was framed by the Anti-Saloon League. Sex explains it all. The Colonel’s Lady and Judy O’Grady are Lesbians under their skin.”",0
8704,"He stopped. “Want to hear some more?”  “Shoot,” I said. “I don’t know any more. Tell you some more at lunch.”",0
8705,"“Old Bill,” I said. “You bum!” We packed the lunch and two bottles of wine in the rucksack, and Bill put it on. I carried the rod-case and the landing-nets slung over my back. We started up the road and then went across a meadow and found a path that crossed the fields and went toward the woods on the slope of the first hill. We walked across the fields on the sandy path. The fields were rolling and grassy and the grass was short from the sheep grazing. The cattle were up in the hills. We heard their bells in the woods.",0
8706,"The path crossed a stream on a foot-log. The log was surfaced off, and there was a sapling bent across for a rail. In the flat pool beside the stream tadpoles spotted the sand. We went up a steep bank and across the rolling fields. Looking back we saw Burguete, white houses and red roofs, and the white road with a truck going along it and the dust rising.",0
8707,"Beyond the fields we crossed another faster-flowing stream. A sandy road led down to the ford and beyond into the woods. The path crossed the stream on another foot-log below the ford, and joined the road, and we went into the woods.",0
8708,"It was a beech wood and the trees were very old. Their roots bulked above the ground and the branches were twisted. We walked on the road between the thick trunks of the old beeches and the sunlight came through the leaves in light patches on the grass. The trees were big, and the foliage was thick but it was not gloomy. There was no undergrowth, only the smooth grass, very green and fresh, and the big gray trees well spaced as though it were a park.",0
8709,"“This is country,” Bill said. The road went up a hill and we got into thick woods, and the road kept on climbing. Sometimes it dipped down but rose again steeply. All the time we heard the cattle in the woods. Finally, the road came out on the top of the hills. We were on the top of the height of land that was the highest part of the range of wooded hills we had seen from Burguete. There were wild strawberries growing on the sunny side of the ridge in a little clearing in the trees.",0
8710,"Ahead the road came out of the forest and went along the shoulder of the ridge of hills. The hills ahead were not wooded, and there were great fields of yellow gorse. Way off we saw the steep bluffs, dark with trees and jutting with gray stone, that marked the course of the Irati River.",0
8711,"“We have to follow this road along the ridge, cross these hills, go through the woods on the far hills, and come down to the Irati valley,” I pointed out to Bill. “That’s a hell of a hike.” “It’s too far to go and fish and come back the same day, comfortably.”  “Comfortably.",0
8712,"That’s a nice word. We’ll have to go like hell to get there and back and have any fishing at all.” It was a long walk and the country was very fine, but we were tired when we came down the steep road that led out of the wooded hills into the valley of the Rio de la Fabrica.",0
8713,The road came out from the shadow of the woods into the hot sun. Ahead was a river-valley. Beyond the river was a steep hill. There was a field of buckwheat on the hill. We saw a white house under some trees on the hillside. It was very hot and we stopped under some trees beside a dam that crossed the river.,0
8714,"Bill put the pack against one of the trees and we jointed up the rods, put on the reels, tied on leaders, and got ready to fish. “You’re sure this thing has trout in it?” Bill asked.",0
8715,“It’s full of them.” “I’m going to fish a fly. You got any McGintys?”  “There’s some in there.”,0
8716,"“You going to fish bait?”  “Yeah. I’m going to fish the dam here.” “Well, I’ll take the fly-book, then.” He tied on a fly. “Where’d I better go? Up or down?”  “Down is the best.",0
8717,"They’re plenty up above, too.” Bill went down the bank. “Take a worm can.”",0
8718,"“No, I don’t want one. If they won’t take a fly I’ll just flick it around.” Bill was down below watching the stream.",0
8719,"“Say,” he called up against the noise of the dam. “How about putting the wine in that spring up the road?”  “All right,” I shouted. Bill waved his hand and started down the stream. I found the two wine-bottles in the pack, and carried them up the road to where the water of a spring flowed out of an iron pipe. There was a board over the spring and I lifted it and, knocking the corks firmly into the bottles, lowered them down into the water. It was so cold my hand and wrist felt numbed. I put back the slab of wood, and hoped nobody would find the wine.",0
8720,"I got my rod that was leaning against the tree, took the bait-can and landing-net, and walked out onto the dam. It was built to provide a head of water for driving logs. The gate was up, and I sat on one of the squared timbers and watched the smooth apron of water before the river tumbled into the falls. In the white water at the foot of the dam it was deep. As I baited up, a trout shot up out of the white water into the falls and was carried down. Before I could finish baiting, another trout jumped at the falls, making the same lovely arc and disappearing into the water that was thundering down. I put on a good-sized sinker and dropped into the white water close to the edge of the timbers of the dam.",0
8721,"I did not feel the first trout strike. When I started to pull up I felt that I had one and brought him, fighting and bending the rod almost double, out of the boiling water at the foot of the falls, and swung him up and onto the dam. He was a good trout, and I banged his head against the timber so that he quivered out straight, and then slipped him into my bag.",0
8722,"While I had him on, several trout had jumped at the falls. As soon as I baited up and dropped in again I hooked another and brought him in the same way. In a little while I had six. They were all about the same size. I laid them out, side by side, all their heads pointing the same way, and looked at them. They were beautifully colored and firm and hard from the cold water. It was a hot day, so I slit them all and shucked out the insides, gills and all, and tossed them over across the river. I took the trout ashore, washed them in the cold, smoothly heavy water above the dam, and then picked some ferns and packed them all in the bag, three trout on a layer of ferns, then another layer of fems, then three more trout, and then covered them with ferns. They looked nice in the ferns, and now the bag was bulky, and I put it in the shade of the tree.",0
8723,"It was very hot on the dam, so I put my worm-can in the shade with the bag, and got a book out of the pack and settled down under the tree to read until Bill should come up for lunch. It was a little past noon and there was not much shade, but I sat against the trunk of two of the trees that grew together, and read. The book was something by A. E. W. Mason, and I was reading a wonderful story about a man who had been frozen in the Alps and then fallen into a glacier and disappeared, and his bride was going to wait twenty-four years exactly for his body to come out on the moraine, while her true love waited too, and they were still waiting when Bill came up.",0
8724,"“Get any?” he asked. He had his rod and his bag and his net all in one hand, and he was sweating. I hadn’t heard him come up, because of the noise from the dam.",0
8725,"“Six. What did you get?”  Bill sat down, opened up his bag, laid a big trout on the grass. He took out three more, each one a little bigger than the last, and laid them side by side in the shade from the tree. His face was sweaty and happy.",0
8726,“How are yours?”  “Smaller.”  “Let’s see them.”  “They’re packed.”  “How big are they really?”  “They’re all about the size of your smallest.” “You’re not holding out on me?”  “I wish I were.” “Get them all on worms?”  “Yes.”  “You lazy bum!”,0
8727,"Bill put the trout in the bag and started for the river, swinging the open bag. He was wet from the waist down and I knew he must have been wading the stream.",0
8728,"I walked up the road and got out the two bottles of wine. They were cold. Moisture beaded on the bottles as I walked back to the trees. I spread the lunch on a newspaper, and uncorked one of the bottles and leaned the other against a tree. Bill came up drying his hands, his bag plump with ferns.",0
8729,"“Let’s see that bottle,” he said. He pulled the cork, and tipped up the bottle and drank. “Whew! That makes my eyes ache.”  “Let’s try it.”",0
8730,"The wine was icy cold and tasted faintly rusty. “That’s not such filthy wine,” Bill said. “The cold helps it,” I said.",0
8731,"We unwrapped the little parcels of lunch. “Chicken.”  “There’s hard-boiled eggs.” “Find any salt?”  “First the egg,” said Bill.",0
8732,“Then the chicken. Even Bryan could see that.” “He’s dead. I read it in the paper yesterday.”,0
8733,"“No. Not really?”  “Yes. Bryan’s dead.” Bill laid down the egg he was peeling. “Gentlemen,” he said, and unwrapped a drumstick from a piece of newspaper. “I reverse the order. For Bryan’s sake. As a tribute to the Great Commoner. First the chicken; then the egg.”  “Wonder what day God created the chicken?”  “Oh,” said Bill, sucking the drumstick, “how should we know?",0
8734,We should not question. Our stay on earth is not for long. Let us rejoice and believe and give thanks.”  “Eat an egg.”,0
8735,"Bill gestured with the drumstick in one hand and the bottle of wine in the other. “Let us rejoice in our blessings. Let us utilize the fowls of the air. Let us utilize the product of the vine. Will you utilize a little, brother?”  “After you, brother.”",0
8736,"Bill took a long drink. “Utilize a little, brother,” he handed me the bottle. “Let us not doubt, brother. Let us not pry into the holy mysteries of the hen-coop with simian fingers. Let us accept on faith and simply say—I want you to join with me in saying—What shall we say, brother?” He pointed the drumstick at me and went on. “Let me tell you. We will say, and I for one am proud to say—and I want you to say with me, on your knees, brother. Let no man be ashamed to kneel here in the great out-of-doors. Remember the woods were God’s first temples. Let us kneel and say: ‘Don’t eat that, Lady—that’s Mencken.’ ”  “Here,” I said.",0
8737,"“Utilize a little of this.” We uncorked the other bottle. “What’s the matter?” I said. “Didn’t you like Bryan?”  “I loved Bryan,” said Bill.",0
8738,“We were like brothers.” “Where did you know him?”  “He and Mencken and I all went to Holy Cross together.” “And Frankie Fritsch.”  “It’s a lie.,0
8739,"Frankie Fritsch went to Fordham.” “Well,” I said, “I went to Loyola with Bishop Manning.” “It’s a lie,” Bill said. “I went to Loyola with Bishop Manning myself.”",0
8740,"“You’re cock-eyed,” I said. “On wine?”  “Why not?”  “It’s the humidity,” Bill said. “They ought to take this damn humidity away.”",0
8741,“Have another shot.” “Is this all we’ve got?”  “Only the two bottles.” “Do you know what you are?” Bill looked at the bottle affectionately.,0
8742,"“No,” I said. “You’re in the pay of the Anti-Saloon League.” “I went to Notre Dame with Wayne B. Wheeler.”",0
8743,"“It’s a lie,” said Bill. “I went to Austin Business College with Wayne B. Wheeler. He was class president.”",0
8744,"“Well,” I said, “the saloon must go.” “You’re right there, old classmate,” Bill said. “The saloon must go, and I will take it with me.”",0
8745,"“You’re cock-eyed.” “On wine?”  “On wine.”  “Well, maybe I am.” “Want to take a nap?”  “All right.”",0
8746,"We lay with our heads in the shade and looked up into the trees. “You asleep?”  “No,” Bill said. “I was thinking.”",0
8747,"I shut my eyes. It felt good lying on the ground. “Say,” Bill said, “what about this Brett business?”  “What about it?”  “Were you ever in love with her?”  “Sure.”  “For how long?”  “Off and on for a hell of a long time.”",0
8748,"“Oh, hell!” Bill said. “I’m sorry, fella.”",0
8749,"“It’s all right,” I said. “I don’t give a damn any more.”  “Really?”  “Really. Only I’d a hell of a lot rather not talk about it.”",0
8750,"“You aren’t sore I asked you?”  “Why the hell should I be?”  “I’m going to sleep,” Bill said. He put a newspaper over his face.",0
8751,"“Listen, Jake,” he said, “are you really a Catholic?”  “Technically.”  “What does that mean?”  “I don’t know.” “All right, I’ll go to sleep now,” he said. “Don’t keep me awake by talking so much.”",0
8752,"I went to sleep, too. When I woke up Bill was packing the rucksack. It was late in the afternoon and the shadow from the trees was long and went out over the dam. I was stiff from sleeping on the ground.",0
8753,“What did you do? Wake up?” Bill asked. “Why didn’t you spend the night?” I stretched and rubbed my eyes.,0
8754,"“I had a lovely dream,” Bill said. “I don’t remember what it was about, but it was a lovely dream.” “I don’t think I dreamt.”",0
8755,"“You ought to dream,” Bill said. “All our biggest business men have been dreamers. Look at Ford. Look at President Coolidge. Look at Rockefeller. Look at Jo Davidson.”",0
8756,I disjointed my rod and Bill’s and packed them in the rod-case. I put the reels in the tackle-bag. Bill had packed the rucksack and we put one of the trout-bags in. I carried the other.,0
8757,"“Well,” said Bill, “have we got everything?”  “The worms.” “Your worms. Put them in there.”",0
8758,He had the pack on his back and I put the worm-cans in one of the outside flap pockets. “You got everything now?”  I looked around on the grass at the foot of the elm-trees.,0
8759,"“Yes.” We started up the road into the woods. It was a long walk home to Burguete, and it was dark when we came down across the fields to the road, and along the road between the houses of the town, their windows lighted, to the inn.",0
8760,"We stayed five days at Burguete and had good fishing. The nights were cold and the days were hot, and there was always a breeze even in the heat of the day. It was hot enough so that it felt good to wade in a cold stream, and the sun dried you when you came out and sat on the bank. We found a stream with a pool deep enough to swim in. In the evenings we played three-handed bridge with an Englishman named Harris, who had walked over from Saint Jean Pied de Port and was stopping at the inn for the fishing. He was very pleasant and went with us twice to the Irati River. There was no word from Robert Cohn nor from Brett and Mike.",0
8761,"CHAPTER 13 One morning I went down to breakfast and the Englishman, Harris, was already at the table. He was reading the paper through spectacles. He looked up and smiled.",0
8762,"“Good morning,” he said. “Letter for you. I stopped at the post and they gave it me with mine.”",0
8763,"The letter was at my place at the table, leaning against a coffee-cup. Harris was reading the paper again. I opened the letter. It had been forwarded from Pamplona. It was dated San Sebastian, Sunday:  Dear Jake,  We got here Friday, Brett passed out on the train, so brought her here for 3 days rest with old friends of ours.",0
8764,"We go to Montoya Hotel Pamplona Tuesday, arriving at I don’t know what hour. Will you send a note by the bus to tell us what to do to rejoin you all on Wednesday. All our love and sorry to be late, but Brett was really done in and will be quite all right by Tues. and is practically so now. I know her so well and try to look after her but it’s not so easy. Love to all the chaps,  Michael.",0
8765,"“What day of the week is it?” I asked Harris. “Wednesday, I think. Yes, quite. Wednesday. Wonderful how one loses track of the days up here in the mountains.”",0
8766,“Yes. We’ve been here nearly a week.” “I hope you’re not thinking of leaving?”  “Yes.,0
8767,"We’ll go in on the afternoon bus, I’m afraid.” “What a rotten business. I had hoped we’d all have another go at the Irati together.”",0
8768,“We have to go into Pamplona. We’re meeting people there.”  “What rotten luck for me. We’ve had a jolly time here at Burguete.”  “Come on in to Pamplona.,0
8769,"We can play some bridge there, and there’s going to be a damned fine fiesta.”  “I’d like to. Awfully nice of you to ask me. I’d best stop on here, though. I’ve not much more time to fish.”",0
8770,"“You want those big ones in the Irati.” “I say, I do, you know. They’re enormous trout there.”",0
8771,“I’d like to try them once more.”  “Do. Stop over another day. Be a good chap.”,0
8772,"“We really have to get into town,” I said. “What a pity.” After breakfast Bill and I were sitting warming in the sun on a bench out in front of the inn and talking it over. I saw a girl coming up the road from the centre of the town. She stopped in front of us and took a telegram out of the leather wallet that hung against her skirt.",0
8773,"“Por ustedes?”  I looked at it. The address was: “Barnes, Burguete.”  “Yes. It’s for us.”",0
8774,"She brought out a book for me to sign, and I gave her a couple of coppers. The telegram was in Spanish: “Vengo Jueves Cohn.” I handed it to Bill.",0
8775,"“What does the word Cohn mean?” he asked. “What a lousy telegram!” I said. “He could send ten words for the same price. ‘I come Thursday.’ That gives you a lot of dope, doesn’t it?”  “It gives you all the dope that’s of interest to Cohn.”",0
8776,"“We’re going in, anyway,” I said. “There’s no use trying to move Brett and Mike out here and back before the fiesta. Should we answer it?”  “We might as well,” said Bill.",0
8777,“There’s no need for us to be snooty.” We walked up to the post-office and asked for a telegraph blank. “What will we say?” Bill asked.,0
8778,“ ‘Arriving to-night.’ That’s enough.” We paid for the message and walked back to the inn. Harris was there and the three of us walked up to Roncesvalles. We went through the monastery.,0
8779,"“It’s a remarkable place,” Harris said, when we came out. “But you know I’m not much on those sort of places.” “Me either,” Bill said.",0
8780,"“It’s a remarkable place, though,” Harris said. “I wouldn’t not have seen it. I’d been intending coming up each day.”",0
8781,"“It isn’t the same as fishing, though, is it?” Bill asked. He liked Harris.",0
8782,"“I say not.” We were standing in front of the old chapel of the monastery. “Isn’t that a pub across the way?” Harris asked. “Or do my eyes deceive me?”  “It has the look of a pub,” Bill said.",0
8783,"“It looks to me like a pub,” I said. “I say,” said Harris, “let’s utilize it.” He had taken up utilizing from Bill.",0
8784,"We had a bottle of wine apiece. Harris would not let us pay. He talked Spanish quite well, and the innkeeper would not take our money.",0
8785,"“I say. You don’t know what it’s meant to me to have you chaps up here.” “We’ve had a grand time, Harris.”",0
8786,Harris was a little tight. “I say. Really you don’t know how much it means. I’ve not had much fun since the war.”,0
8787,"“We’ll fish together again, some time. Don’t you forget it, Harris.” “We must. We have had such a jolly good time.”",0
8788,"“How about another bottle around?”  “Jolly good idea,” said Harris. “This is mine,” said Bill. “Or we don’t drink it.”",0
8789,"“I wish you’d let me pay for it. It does give me pleasure, you know.” “This is going to give me pleasure,” Bill said.",0
8790,The innkeeper brought in the fourth bottle. We had kept the same glasses. Harris lifted his glass.,0
8791,“I say. You know this does utilize well.” Bill slapped him on the back.,0
8792,"“Good old Harris.”  “I say. You know my name isn’t really Harris. It’s Wilson-Harris. All one name. With a hyphen, you know.”  “Good old Wilson-Harris,” Bill said.",0
8793,"“We call you Harris because we’re so fond of you.” “I say, Barnes. You don’t know what this all means to me.”  “Come on and utilize another glass,” I said.",0
8794,"“Barnes. Really, Barnes, you can’t know. That’s all.”  “Drink up, Harris.”",0
8795,"We walked back down the road from Roncesvalles with Harris between us. We had lunch at the inn and Harris went with us to the bus. He gave us his card, with his address in London and his club and his business address, and as we got on the bus he handed us each an envelope. I opened mine and there were a dozen flies in it. Harris had tied them himself. He tied all his own flies.",0
8796,"“I say, Harris—” I began. “No, no!” he said. He was climbing down from the bus. “They’re not first-rate flies at all. I only thought if you fished them some time it might remind you of what a good time we had.”",0
8797,"The bus started. Harris stood in front of the post-office. He waved. As we started along the road he turned and walked back toward the inn.  “Say, wasn’t that Harris nice?”",0
8798,Bill said. “I think he really did have a good time.”  “Harris? You bet he did.”,0
8799,"“I wish he’d come into Pamplona.” “He wanted to fish.” “Yes. You couldn’t tell how English would mix with each other, anyway.”",0
8800,"“I suppose not.” We got into Pamplona late in the afternoon and the bus stopped in front of the Hotel Montoya. Out in the plaza they were stringing electric-light wires to light the plaza for the fiesta. A few kids came up when the bus stopped, and a customs officer for the town made all the people getting down from the bus open their bundles on the sidewalk. We went into the hotel and on the stairs I met Montoya. He shook hands with us, smiling in his embarrassed way.",0
8801,"“Your friends are here,” he said. “Mr. Campbell?”  “Yes. Mr. Cohn and Mr. Campbell and Lady Ashley.”",0
8802,He smiled as though there were something I would hear about. “When did they get in?”  “Yesterday. I’ve saved you the rooms you had.”,0
8803,“That’s fine. Did you give Mr. Campbell the room on the plaza?”  “Yes. All the rooms we looked at.”  “Where are our friends now?”  “I think they went to the pelota.”,0
8804,"“And how about the bulls?”  Montoya smiled. “To-night,” he said. “To-night at seven o’clock they bring in the Villar bulls, and to-morrow come the Miuras. Do you all go down?”  “Oh, yes.",0
8805,They’ve never seen a desencajonada.” Montoya put his hand on my shoulder. “I’ll see you there.”,0
8806,"He smiled again. He always smiled as though bull-fighting were a very special secret between the two of us; a rather shocking but really very deep secret that we knew about. He always smiled as though there were something lewd about the secret to outsiders, but that it was something that we understood. It would not do to expose it to people who would not understand.",0
8807,"“Your friend, is he aficionado, too?” Montoya smiled at Bill. “Yes. He came all the way from New York to see the San Fermines.”",0
8808,“Yes?” Montoya politely disbelieved. “But he’s not aficionado like you.”,0
8809,"He put his hand on my shoulder again embarrassedly. “Yes,” I said. “He’s a real aficionado.”",0
8810,"“But he’s not aficionado like you are.” Aficion means passion. An aficionado is one who is passionate about the bull-fights. All the good bull-fighters stayed at Montoya’s hotel; that is, those with aficion stayed there. The commercial bull-fighters stayed once, perhaps, and then did not come back. The good ones came each year. In Montoya’s room were their photographs. The photographs were dedicated to Juanito Montoya or to his sister. The photographs of bull-fighters Montoya had really believed in were framed. Photographs of bull-fighters who had been without aficion Montoya kept in a drawer of his desk. They often had the most flattering inscriptions. But they did not mean anything. One day Montoya took them all out and dropped them in the waste-basket. He did not want them around.",0
8811,"We often talked about bulls and bull-fighters. I had stopped at the Montoya for several years. We never talked for very long at a time. It was simply the pleasure of discovering what we each felt. Men would come in from distant towns and before they left Pamplona stop and talk for a few minutes with Montoya about bulls. These men were aficionados. Those who were aficionados could always get rooms even when the hotel was full. Montoya introduced me to some of them. They were always very polite at first, and it amused them very much that I should be an American. Somehow it was taken for granted that an American could not have aficion. He might simulate it or confuse it with excitement, but he could not really have it. When they saw that I had aficion, and there was no password, no set questions that could bring it out, rather it was a sort of oral spiritual examination with the questions always a little on the defensive and never apparent, there was this same embarrassed putting the hand on the shoulder, or a “Buen hombre.” But nearly always there was the actual touching. It seemed as though they wanted to touch you to make it certain.",0
8812,"Montoya could forgive anything of a bull-fighter who had aficion. He could forgive attacks of nerves, panic, bad unexplainable actions, all sorts of lapses. For one who had aficion he could forgive anything. At once he forgave me all my friends. Without his ever saying anything they were simply a little something shameful between us, like the spilling open of the horses in bull-fighting.",0
8813,"Bill had gone up-stairs as we came in, and I found him washing and changing in his room. “Well,” he said, “talk a lot of Spanish?”  “He was telling me about the bulls coming in to-night.”  “Let’s find the gang and go down.” “All right. They’ll probably be at the café.”",0
8814,"“Have you got tickets?”  “Yes. I got them for all the unloadings.” “What’s it like?” He was pulling his cheek before the glass, looking to see if there were unshaved patches under the line of the jaw.",0
8815,"“It’s pretty good,” I said. “They let the bulls out of the cages one at a time, and they have steers in the corral to receive them and keep them from fighting, and the bulls tear in at the steers and the steers run around like old maids trying to quiet them down.” “Do they ever gore the steers?”  “Sure.",0
8816,"Sometimes they go right after them and kill them.”  “Can’t the steers do anything?”  “No. They’re trying to make friends.” “What do they have them in for?”  “To quiet down the bulls and keep them from breaking horns against the stone walls, or goring each other.”  “Must be swell being a steer.”",0
8817,"We went down the stairs and out of the door and walked across the square toward the Café Iruña. There were two lonely looking ticket-houses standing in the square. Their windows, marked SOL, SOL Y SOMBRA, and SOMBRA, were shut. They would not open until the day before the fiesta.",0
8818,Across the square the white wicker tables and chairs of the Iruña extended out beyond the Arcade to the edge of the street. I looked for Brett and Mike at the tables. There they were. Brett and Mike and Robert Cohn. Brett was wearing a Basque beret. So was Mike. Robert Cohn was bare-headed and wearing his spectacles. Brett saw us coming and waved. Her eyes crinkled up as we came up to the table.,0
8819,"“Hello, you chaps!” she called. Brett was happy. Mike had a way of getting an intensity of feeling into shaking hands. Robert Cohn shook hands because we were back.",0
8820,"“Where the hell have you been?” I asked. “I brought them up here,” Cohn said.",0
8821,"“What rot,” Brett said. “We’d have gotten here earlier if you hadn’t come.” “You’d never have gotten here.”",0
8822,“What rot! You chaps are brown. Look at Bill.”,0
8823,“Did you get good fishing?” Mike asked. “We wanted to join you.”,0
8824,"“It wasn’t bad. We missed you.” “I wanted to come,” Cohn said, “but I thought I ought to bring them.”",0
8825,“You bring us. What rot.”  “Was it really good?” Mike asked. “Did you take many?”  “Some days we took a dozen apiece.,0
8826,"There was an Englishman up there.”  “Named Harris,” Bill said. “Ever know him, Mike? He was in the war, too.”",0
8827,"“Fortunate fellow,” Mike said. “What times we had. How I wish those dear days were back.”  “Don’t be an ass.”  “Were you in the war, Mike?”",0
8828,"Cohn asked. “Was I not.” “He was a very distinguished soldier,” Brett said. “Tell them about the time your horse bolted down Piccadilly.”",0
8829,"“I’ll not. I’ve told that four times.” “You never told me,” Robert Cohn said.",0
8830,“I’ll not tell that story. It reflects discredit on me.” “Tell them about your medals.”,0
8831,“I’ll not. That story reflects great discredit on me.”  “What story’s that?”  “Brett will tell you. She tells all the stories that reflect discredit on me.”  “Go on.,0
8832,"Tell it, Brett.” “Should I?”  “I’ll tell it myself.” “What medals have you got, Mike?”  “I haven’t got any medals.”",0
8833,"“You must have some.” “I suppose I’ve the usual medals. But I never sent in for them. One time there was this wopping big dinner and the Prince of Wales was to be there, and the cards said medals will be worn. So naturally I had no medals, and I stopped at my tailor’s and he was impressed by the invitation, and I thought that’s a good piece of business, and I said to him: ‘You’ve got to fix me up with some medals.’ He said: ‘What medals, sir?’ And I said: ‘Oh, any medals. Just give me a few medals.’ So he said: ‘What medals have you, sir?’ And I said: ‘How should I know?’ Did he think I spent all my time reading the bloody gazette? ‘Just give me a good lot. Pick them out yourself.’ So he got me some medals, you know, miniature medals, and handed me the box, and I put it in my pocket and forgot it. Well, I went to the dinner, and it was the night they’d shot Henry Wilson, so the Prince didn’t come and the King didn’t come, and no one wore any medals, and all these coves were busy taking off their medals, and I had mine in my pocket.”",0
8834,He stopped for us to laugh. “Is that all?”  “That’s all. Perhaps I didn’t tell it right.”,0
8835,"“You didn’t,” said Brett. “But no matter.” We were all laughing.",0
8836,"“Ah, yes,” said Mike. “I know now. It was a damn dull dinner, and I couldn’t stick it, so I left. Later on in the evening I found the box in my pocket. What’s this? I said. Medals? Bloody military medals? So I cut them all off their backing—you know, they put them on a strip—and gave them all around. Gave one to each girl. Form of souvenir. They thought I was hell’s own shakes of a soldier. Give away medals in a night club. Dashing fellow.”  “Tell the rest,” Brett said.",0
8837,"“Don’t you think that was funny?” Mike asked. We were all laughing. “It was. I swear it was. Any rate, my tailor wrote me and wanted the medals back. Sent a man around. Kept on writing for months. Seems some chap had left them to be cleaned. Frightfully military cove. Set hell’s own store by them.” Mike paused. “Rotten luck for the tailor,” he said.",0
8838,"“You don’t mean it,” Bill said. “I should think it would have been grand for the tailor.” “Frightfully good tailor. Never believe it to see me now,” Mike said. “I used to pay him a hundred pounds a year just to keep him quiet. So he wouldn’t send me any bills. Frightful blow to him when I went bankrupt. It was right after the medals. Gave his letters rather a bitter tone.”",0
8839,"“How did you go bankrupt?” Bill asked. “Two ways,” Mike said. “Gradually and then suddenly.”  “What brought it on?”  “Friends,” said Mike.",0
8840,"“I had a lot of friends. False friends. Then I had creditors, too. Probably had more creditors than anybody in England.”",0
8841,"“Tell them about in the court,” Brett said. “I don’t remember,” Mike said. “I was just a little tight.”",0
8842,"“Tight!” Brett exclaimed. “You were blind!”  “Extraordinary thing,” Mike said.",0
8843,"“Met my former partner the other day. Offered to buy me a drink.”  “Tell them about your learned counsel,” Brett said. “I will not,” Mike said. “My learned counsel was blind, too. I say this is a gloomy subject. Are we going down and see these bulls unloaded or not?”  “Let’s go down.”",0
8844,"We called the waiter, paid, and started to walk through the town. I started off walking with Brett, but Robert Cohn came up and joined her on the other side. The three of us walked along, past the Ayuntamiento with the banners hung from the balcony, down past the market and down past the steep street that led to the bridge across the Arga. There were many people walking to go and see the bulls, and carriages drove down the hill and across the bridge, the drivers, the horses, and the whips rising above the walking people in the street. Across the bridge we turned up a road to the corrals. We passed a wine-shop with a sign in the window: Good Wine 30 Centimes A Liter.",0
8845,"“That’s where we’ll go when funds get low,” Brett said. The woman standing in the door of the wine-shop looked at us as we passed. She called to some one in the house and three girls came to the window and stared. They were staring at Brett.",0
8846,"At the gate of the corrals two men took tickets from the people that went in. We went in through the gate. There were trees inside and a low, stone house. At the far end was the stone wall of the corrals, with apertures in the stone that were like loopholes running all along the face of each corral. A ladder led up to the top of the wall, and people were climbing up the ladder and spreading down to stand on the walls that separated the two corrals. As we came up the ladder, walking across the grass under the trees, we passed the big, gray painted cages with the bulls in them. There was one bull in each travelling-box. They had come by train from a bull-breeding ranch in Castile, and had been unloaded off flat-cars at the station and brought up here to be let out of their cages into the corrals. Each cage was stencilled with the name and the brand of the bull-breeder.",0
8847,"We climbed up and found a place on the wall looking down into the corral. The stone walls were whitewashed, and there was straw on the ground and wooden feed-boxes and water-troughs set against the wall. “Look up there,” I said.",0
8848,Beyond the river rose the plateau of the town. All along the old walls and ramparts people were standing. The three lines of fortifications made three black lines of people. Above the walls there were heads in the windows of the houses. At the far end of the plateau boys had climbed into the trees.,0
8849,"“They must think something is going to happen,” Brett said. “They want to see the bulls.” Mike and Bill were on the other wall across the pit of the corral. They waved to us. People who had come late were standing behind us, pressing against us when other people crowded them.",0
8850,"“Why don’t they start?” Robert Cohn asked. A single mule was hitched to one of the cages and dragged it up against the gate in the corral wall. The men shoved and lifted it with crowbars into position against the gate. Men were standing on the wall ready to pull up the gate of the corral and then the gate of the cage. At the other end of the corral a gate opened and two steers came in, swaying their heads and trotting, their lean flanks swinging. They stood together at the far end, their heads toward the gate where the bull would enter.",0
8851,"“They don’t look happy,” Brett said. The men on top of the wall leaned back and pulled up the door of the corral. Then they pulled up the door of the cage.",0
8852,"I leaned way over the wall and tried to see into the cage. It was dark. Some one rapped on the cage with an iron bar. Inside something seemed to explode. The bull, striking into the wood from side to side with his horns, made a great noise. Then I saw a dark muzzle and the shadow of horns, and then, with a clattering on the wood in the hollow box, the bull charged and came out into the corral, skidding with his forefeet in the straw as he stopped, his head up, the great hump of muscle on his neck swollen tight, his body muscles quivering as he looked up at the crowd on the stone walls. The two steers backed away against the wall, their heads sunken, their eyes watching the bull.",0
8853,"The bull saw them and charged. A man shouted from behind one of the boxes and slapped his hat against the planks, and the bull, before he reached the steer, turned, gathered himself and charged where the man had been, trying to reach him behind the planks with a half-dozen quick, searching drives with the right horn. “My God, isn’t he beautiful?” Brett said. We were looking right down on him.",0
8854,"“Look how he knows how to use his horns,” I said. “He’s got a left and a right just like a boxer.” “Not really?”  “You watch.”",0
8855,"“It goes too fast.”  “Wait. There’ll be another one in a minute.” They had backed up another cage into the entrance. In the far corner a man, from behind one of the plank shelters, attracted the bull, and while the bull was facing away the gate was pulled up and a second bull came out into the corral.",0
8856,"He charged straight for the steers and two men ran out from behind the planks and shouted, to turn him. He did not change his direction and the men shouted: “Hah! Hah! Toro!” and waved their arms; the two steers turned sideways to take the shock, and the bull drove into one of the steers. “Don’t look,” I said to Brett. She was watching, fascinated.",0
8857,"“Fine,” I said. “If it doesn’t buck you.”  “I saw it,” she said. “I saw him shift from his left to his right horn.”",0
8858,"“Damn good!” The steer was down now, his neck stretched out, his head twisted, he lay the way he had fallen. Suddenly the bull left off and made for the other steer which had been standing at the far end, his head swinging, watching it all. The steer ran awkwardly and the bull caught him, hooked him lightly in the flank, and then turned away and looked up at the crowd on the walls, his crest of muscle rising. The steer came up to him and made as though to nose at him and the bull hooked perfunctorily. The next time he nosed at the steer and then the two of them trotted over to the other bull.",0
8859,"When the next bull came out, all three, the two bulls and the steer, stood together, their heads side by side, their horns against the newcomer. In a few minutes the steer picked the new bull up, quieted him down, and made him one of the herd. When the last two bulls had been unloaded the herd were all together.",0
8860,"The steer who had been gored had gotten to his feet and stood against the stone wall. None of the bulls came near him, and he did not attempt to join the herd. We climbed down from the wall with the crowd, and had a last look at the bulls through the loopholes in the wall of the corral. They were all quiet now, their heads down. We got a carriage outside and rode up to the café. Mike and Bill came in half an hour later. They had stopped on the way for several drinks.",0
8861,"We were sitting in the café. “That’s an extraordinary business,” Brett said. “Will those last ones fight as well as the first?” Robert Cohn asked. “They seemed to quiet down awfully fast.”",0
8862,"“They all know each other,” I said. “They’re only dangerous when they’re alone, or only two or three of them together.” “What do you mean, dangerous?” Bill said. “They all looked dangerous to me.”",0
8863,"“They only want to kill when they’re alone. Of course, if you went in there you’d probably detach one of them from the herd, and he’d be dangerous.”  “That’s too complicated,” Bill said. “Don’t you ever detach me from the herd, Mike.”",0
8864,"“I say,” Mike said, “they were fine bulls, weren’t they? Did you see their horns?”  “Did I not,” said Brett. “I had no idea what they were like.”",0
8865,“Did you see the one hit that steer?” Mike asked. “That was extraordinary.”,0
8866,"“It’s no life being a steer,” Robert Cohn said. “Don’t you think so?” Mike said. “I would have thought you’d loved being a steer, Robert.”  “What do you mean, Mike?”  “They lead such a quiet life.",0
8867,They never say anything and they’re always hanging about so.” We were embarrassed. Bill laughed. Robert Cohn was angry. Mike went on talking.,0
8868,"“I should think you’d love it. You’d never have to say a word. Come on, Robert. Do say something. Don’t just sit there.”",0
8869,"“I said something, Mike. Don’t you remember? About the steers.”",0
8870,"“Oh, say something more. Say something funny. Can’t you see we’re all having a good time here?”  “Come off it, Michael.",0
8871,"You’re drunk,” Brett said. “I’m not drunk. I’m quite serious. Is Robert Cohn going to follow Brett around like a steer all the time?”  “Shut up, Michael.",0
8872,"Try and show a little breeding.” “Breeding be damned. Who has any breeding, anyway, except the bulls? Aren’t the bulls lovely? Don’t you like them, Bill? Why don’t you say something, Robert? Don’t sit there looking like a bloody funeral. What if Brett did sleep with you? She’s slept with lots of better people than you.”  “Shut up,” Cohn said.",0
8873,"He stood up. “Shut up, Mike.” “Oh, don’t stand up and act as though you were going to hit me. That won’t make any difference to me. Tell me, Robert. Why do you follow Brett around like a poor bloody steer? Don’t you know you’re not wanted? I know when I’m not wanted. Why don’t you know when you’re not wanted? You came down to San Sebastian where you weren’t wanted, and followed Brett around like a bloody steer. Do you think that’s right?”  “Shut up.",0
8874,"You’re drunk.” “Perhaps I am drunk. Why aren’t you drunk? Why don’t you ever get drunk, Robert? You know you didn’t have a good time at San Sebastian because none of our friends would invite you on any of the parties. You can’t blame them hardly. Can you? I asked them to. They wouldn’t do it. You can’t blame them, now. Can you? Now, answer me. Can you blame them?”  “Go to hell, Mike.”",0
8875,"“I can’t blame them. Can you blame them? Why do you follow Brett around? Haven’t you any manners? How do you think it makes me feel?”  “You’re a splendid one to talk about manners,” Brett said.",0
8876,"“You’ve such lovely manners.”  “Come on, Robert,” Bill said. “What do you follow her around for?”  Bill stood up and took hold of Cohn. “Don’t go,” Mike said. “Robert Cohn’s going to buy a drink.”",0
8877,Bill went off with Cohn. Cohn’s face was sallow. Mike went on talking. I sat and listened for a while. Brett looked disgusted.,0
8878,"“I say, Michael, you might not be such a bloody ass,” she interrupted. “I’m not saying he’s not right, you know.” She turned to me.",0
8879,"The emotion left Mike’s voice. We were all friends together. “I’m not so damn drunk as I sounded,” he said.",0
8880,"“I know you’re not,” Brett said. “We’re none of us sober,” I said. “I didn’t say anything I didn’t mean.”",0
8881,"“But you put it so badly,” Brett laughed. “He was an ass, though. He came down to San Sebastian where he damn well wasn’t wanted. He hung around Brett and just looked at her. It made me damned well sick.”",0
8882,"“He did behave very badly,” Brett said. “Mark you. Brett’s had affairs with men before. She tells me all about everything. She gave me this chap Cohn’s letters to read. I wouldn’t read them.”",0
8883,"“Damned noble of you.”  “No, listen, Jake. Brett’s gone off with men. But they weren’t ever Jews, and they didn’t come and hang about afterward.”  “Damned good chaps,” Brett said.",0
8884,“It’s all rot to talk about it. Michael and I understand each other.” “She gave me Robert Cohn’s letters. I wouldn’t read them.”,0
8885,"“You wouldn’t read any letters, darling. You wouldn’t read mine.” “I can’t read letters,” Mike said. “Funny, isn’t it?”  “You can’t read anything.”  “No.",0
8886,You’re wrong there. I read quite a bit. I read when I’m at home.”,0
8887,"“You’ll be writing next,” Brett said. “Come on, Michael. Do buck up. You’ve got to go through with this thing now. He’s here. Don’t spoil the fiesta.”",0
8888,"“Well, let him behave, then.”  “He’ll behave. I’ll tell him.” “You tell him, Jake. Tell him either he must behave or get out.”",0
8889,"“Yes,” I said, “it would be nice for me to tell him.”  “Look, Brett. Tell Jake what Robert calls you. That is perfect, you know.”",0
8890,"“Oh, no. I can’t.” “Go on. We’re all friends. Aren’t we all friends, Jake?”  “I can’t tell him.",0
8891,"It’s too ridiculous.” “I’ll tell him.” “You won’t, Michael. Don’t be an ass.”",0
8892,"“He calls her Circe,” Mike said. “He claims she turns men into swine. Damn good. I wish I were one of these literary chaps.”",0
8893,"“He’d be good, you know,” Brett said. “He writes a good letter.” “I know,” I said. “He wrote me from San Sebastian.”",0
8894,"“That was nothing,” Brett said. “He can write a damned amusing letter.” “She made me write that. She was supposed to be ill.”",0
8895,"“I damned well was, too.”  “Come on,” I said, “we must go in and eat.” “How should I meet Cohn?” Mike said.",0
8896,"“Just act as though nothing had happened.”  “It’s quite all right with me,” Mike said. “I’m not embarrassed.” “If he says anything, just say you were tight.”  “Quite.",0
8897,"And the funny thing is I think I was tight.”  “Come on,” Brett said. “Are these poisonous things paid for? I must bathe before dinner.”",0
8898,We walked across the square. It was dark and all around the square were the lights from the cafés under the arcades. We walked across the gravel under the trees to the hotel.,0
8899,"They went up-stairs and I stopped to speak with Montoya. “Well, how did you like the bulls?” he asked. “Good. They were nice bulls.”",0
8900,“They’re all right”—Montoya shook his head—“but they’re not too good.” “What didn’t you like about them?”  “I don’t know. They just didn’t give me the feeling that they were so good.”,0
8901,“I know what you mean.” “They’re all right.” “Yes. They’re all right.”,0
8902,"“How did your friends like them?”  “Fine.”  “Good,” Montoya said. I went up-stairs. Bill was in his room standing on the balcony looking out at the square. I stood beside him.",0
8903,"“Where’s Cohn?”  “Up-stairs in his room.”  “How does he feel?”  “Like hell, naturally. Mike was awful. He’s terrible when he’s tight.”",0
8904,“He wasn’t so tight.” “The hell he wasn’t. I know what we had before we came to the café.”,0
8905,"“He sobered up afterward.” “Good. He was terrible. I don’t like Cohn, God knows, and I think it was a silly trick for him to go down to San Sebastian, but nobody has any business to talk like Mike.”",0
8906,“How’d you like the bulls?”  “Grand. It’s grand the way they bring them out.”  “To-morrow come the Miuras.” “When does the fiesta start?”  “Day after to-morrow.”,0
8907,“We’ve got to keep Mike from getting so tight. That kind of stuff is terrible.” “We’d better get cleaned up for supper.”,0
8908,“Yes. That will be a pleasant meal.” “Won’t it?”,0
8909,"As a matter of fact, supper was a pleasant meal. Brett wore a black, sleeveless evening dress. She looked quite beautiful. Mike acted as though nothing had happened. I had to go up and bring Robert Cohn down. He was reserved and formal, and his face was still taut and sallow, but he cheered up finally. He could not stop looking at Brett. It seemed to make him happy. It must have been pleasant for him to see her looking so lovely, and know he had been away with her and that every one knew it. They could not take that away from him. Bill was very funny. So was Michael. They were good together.",0
8910,"It was like certain dinners I remember from the war. There was much wine, an ignored tension, and a feeling of things coming that you could not prevent happening. Under the wine I lost the disgusted feeling and was happy. It seemed they were all such nice people.",0
8911,"CHAPTER 14 I do not know what time I got to bed. I remember undressing, putting on a bathrobe, and standing out on the balcony. I knew I was quite drunk, and when I came in I put on the light over the head of the bed and started to read. I was reading a book by Turgenieff. Probably I read the same two pages over several times. It was one of the stories in “A Sportsman’s Sketches.” I had read it before, but it seemed quite new. The country became very clear and the feeling of pressure in my head seemed to loosen. I was very drunk and I did not want to shut my eyes because the room would go round and round. If I kept on reading that feeling would pass.",0
8912,"I heard Brett and Robert Cohn come up the stairs. Cohn said good night outside the door and went on up to his room. I heard Brett go into the room next door. Mike was already in bed. He had come in with me an hour before. He woke as she came in, and they talked together. I heard them laugh. I turned off the light and tried to go to sleep. It was not necessary to read any more. I could shut my eyes without getting the wheeling sensation. But I could not sleep. There is no reason why because it is dark you should look at things differently from when it is light. The hell there isn’t!",0
8913,"I figured that all out once, and for six months I never slept with the electric light off. That was another bright idea. To hell with women, anyway. To hell with you, Brett Ashley.",0
8914,"Women made such swell friends. Awfully swell. In the first place, you had to be in love with a woman to have a basis of friendship. I had been having Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it. I had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the presentation of the bill. The bill always came. That was one of the swell things you could count on.",0
8915,"I thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays and pays. No idea of retribution or punishment. Just exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for something. You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances, or by money. Enjoying living was learning to get your money’s worth and knowing when you had it. You could get your money’s worth. The world was a good place to buy in. It seemed like a fine philosophy. In five years, I thought, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies I’ve had.",0
8916,"Perhaps that wasn’t true, though. Perhaps as you went along you did learn something. I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to know was how to live in it. Maybe if you found out how to live in it you learned from that what it was all about.",0
8917,"I wished Mike would not behave so terribly to Cohn, though. Mike was a bad drunk. Brett was a good drunk. Bill was a good drunk. Cohn was never drunk. Mike was unpleasant after he passed a certain point. I liked to see him hurt Cohn. I wished he would not do it, though, because afterward it made me disgusted at myself. That was morality; things that made you disgusted afterward. No, that must be immorality. That was a large statement. What a lot of bilge I could think up at night. What rot, I could hear Brett say it. What rot! When you were with English you got into the habit of using English expressions in your thinking. The English spoken language—the upper classes, anyway—must have fewer words than the Eskimo. Of course I didn’t know anything about the Eskimo. Maybe the Eskimo was a fine language. Say the Cherokee. I didn’t know anything about the Cherokee, either. The English talked with inflected phrases. One phrase to mean everything. I liked them, though. I liked the way they talked. Take Harris. Still Harris was not the upper classes.",0
8918,"I turned on the light again and read. I read the Turgenieff. I knew that now, reading it in the oversensitized state of my mind after much too much brandy, I would remember it somewhere, and afterward it would seem as though it had really happened to me. I would always have it. That was another good thing you paid for and then had. Some time along toward daylight I went to sleep.",0
8919,"The next two days in Pamplona were quiet, and there were no more rows. The town was getting ready for the fiesta. Workmen put up the gate-posts that were to shut off the side streets when the bulls were released from the corrals and came running through the streets in the morning on their way to the ring. The workmen dug holes and fitted in the timbers, each timber numbered for its regular place. Out on the plateau beyond the town employees of the bull-ring exercised picador horses, galloping them stiff-legged on the hard, sun-baked fields behind the bull-ring. The big gate of the bull-ring was open, and inside the amphitheatre was being swept. The ring was rolled and sprinkled, and carpenters replaced weakened or cracked planks in the barrera. Standing at the edge of the smooth rolled sand you could look up in the empty stands and see old women sweeping out the boxes.",0
8920,"Outside, the fence that led from the last street of the town to the entrance of the bull-ring was already in place and made a long pen; the crowd would come running down with the bulls behind them on the morning of the day of the first bull-fight. Out across the plain, where the horse and cattle fair would be, some gypsies had camped under the trees. The wine and aguardiente sellers were putting up their booths. One booth advertised ANIS DEL TORO. The cloth sign hung against the planks in the hot sun. In the big square that was the centre of the town there was no change yet. We sat in the white wicker chairs on the terrasse of the café and watched the motor-buses come in and unload peasants from the country coming in to the market, and we watched the buses fill up and start out with peasants sitting with their saddle-bags full of the things they had bought in the town. The tall gray motor-buses were the only life of the square except for the pigeons and the man with a hose who sprinkled the gravelled square and watered the streets.",0
8921,"In the evening was the paseo. For an hour after dinner every one, all the good-looking girls, the officers from the garrison, all the fashionable people of the town, walked in the street on one side of the square while the café tables filled with the regular after-dinner crowd. During the morning I usually sat in the café and read the Madrid papers and then walked in the town or out into the country. Sometimes Bill went along. Sometimes he wrote in his room. Robert Cohn spent the mornings studying Spanish or trying to get a shave at the barber-shop. Brett and Mike never got up until noon. We all had a vermouth at the café. It was a quiet life and no one was drunk. I went to church a couple of times, once with Brett. She said she wanted to hear me go to confession, but I told her that not only was it impossible but it was not as interesting as it sounded, and, besides, it would be in a language she did not know. We met Cohn as we came out of church, and although it was obvious he had followed us, yet he was very pleasant and nice, and we all three went for a walk out to the gypsy camp, and Brett had her fortune told.",0
8922,"It was a good morning, there were high white clouds above the mountains. It had rained a little in the night and it was fresh and cool on the plateau, and there was a wonderful view. We all felt good and we felt healthy, and I felt quite friendly to Cohn. You could not be upset about anything on a day like that.",0
8923,"That was the last day before the fiesta. CHAPTER 15 At noon of Sunday, the 6th of July, the fiesta exploded. There is no other way to describe it. People had been coming in all day from the country, but they were assimilated in the town and you did not notice them. The square was as quiet in the hot sun as on any other day. The peasants were in the outlying wine-shops. There they were drinking, getting ready for the fiesta. They had come in so recently from the plains and the hills that it was necessary that they make their shifting in values gradually. They could not start in paying café prices. They got their money’s worth in the wine-shops. Money still had a definite value in hours worked and bushels of grain sold. Late in the fiesta it would not matter what they paid, nor where they bought.",0
8924,"Now on the day of the starting of the fiesta of San Fermin they had been in the wine-shops of the narrow streets of the town since early morning. Going down the streets in the morning on the way to mass in the cathedral, I heard them singing through the open doors of the shops. They were warming up. There were many people at the eleven o’clock mass. San Fermin is also a religious festival.",0
8925,I walked down the hill from the cathedral and up the street to the café on the square. It was a little before noon. Robert Cohn and Bill were sitting at one of the tables. The marble-topped tables and the white wicker chairs were gone. They were replaced by cast-iron tables and severe folding chairs. The café was like a battleship stripped for action. To-day the waiters did not leave you alone all morning to read without asking if you wanted to order something. A waiter came up as soon as I sat down.,0
8926,"“What are you drinking?” I asked Bill and Robert. “Sherry,” Cohn said.",0
8927,"“Jerez,” I said to the waiter. Before the waiter brought the sherry the rocket that announced the fiesta went up in the square. It burst and there was a gray ball of smoke high up above the Theatre Gayarre, across on the other side of the plaza. The ball of smoke hung in the sky like a shrapnel burst, and as I watched, another rocket came up to it, trickling smoke in the bright sunlight. I saw the bright flash as it burst and another little cloud of smoke appeared. By the time the second rocket had burst there were so many people in the arcade, that had been empty a minute before, that the waiter, holding the bottle high up over his head, could hardly get through the crowd to our table. People were coming into the square from all sides, and down the street we heard the pipes and the fifes and the drums coming. They were playing the riau-riau music, the pipes shrill and the drums pounding, and behind them came the men and boys dancing. When the fifers stopped they all crouched down in the street, and when the reed-pipes and the fifes shrilled, and the flat, dry, hollow drums tapped it out again, they all went up in the air dancing. In the crowd you saw only the heads and shoulders of the dancers going up and down.",0
8928,"In the square a man, bent over, was playing on a reed-pipe, and a crowd of children were following him shouting, and pulling at his clothes. He came out of the square, the children following him, and piped them past the café and down a side street. We saw his blank pockmarked face as he went by, piping, the children close behind him shouting and pulling at him.",0
8929,"“He must be the village idiot,” Bill said. “My God! look at that!” Down the street came dancers. The street was solid with dancers, all men. They were all dancing in time behind their own fifers and drummers. They were a club of some sort, and all wore workmen’s blue smocks, and red handkerchiefs around their necks, and carried a great banner on two poles. The banner danced up and down with them as they came down surrounded by the crowd.",0
8930,“Hurray for Wine! Hurray for the Foreigners!” was painted on the banner. “Where are the foreigners?” Robert Cohn asked.,0
8931,"“We’re the foreigners,” Bill said. All the time rockets were going up. The café tables were all full now. The square was emptying of people and the crowd was filling the cafés.",0
8932,"“Where’s Brett and Mike?” Bill asked. “I’ll go and get them,” Cohn said.",0
8933,"“Bring them here.” The fiesta was really started. It kept up day and night for seven days. The dancing kept up, the drinking kept up, the noise went on. The things that happened could only have happened during a fiesta. Everything became quite unreal finally and it seemed as though nothing could have any consequences. It seemed out of place to think of consequences during the fiesta. All during the fiesta you had the feeling, even when it was quiet, that you had to shout any remark to make it heard. It was the same feeling about any action. It was a fiesta and it went on for seven days.",0
8934,"That afternoon was the big religious procession. San Fermin was translated from one church to another. In the procession were all the dignitaries, civil and religious. We could not see them because the crowd was too great. Ahead of the formal procession and behind it danced the riau-riau dancers. There was one mass of yellow shirts dancing up and down in the crowd. All we could see of the procession through the closely pressed people that crowded all the side streets and curbs were the great giants, cigar-store Indians, thirty feet high, Moors, a King and Queen, whirling and waltzing solemnly to the riau-riau.",0
8935,"They were all standing outside the chapel where San Fermin and the dignitaries had passed in, leaving a guard of soldiers, the giants, with the men who danced in them standing beside their resting frames, and the dwarfs moving with their whacking bladders through the crowd. We started inside and there was a smell of incense and people filing back into the church, but Brett was stopped just inside the door because she had no hat, so we went out again and along the street that ran back from the chapel into town. The street was lined on both sides with people keeping their place at the curb for the return of the procession. Some dancers formed a circle around Brett and started to dance. They wore big wreaths of white garlics around their necks. They took Bill and me by the arms and put us in the circle. Bill started to dance, too. They were all chanting. Brett wanted to dance but they did not want her to. They wanted her as an image to dance around. When the song ended with the sharp riau-riau! they rushed us into a wine-shop.",0
8936,"We stood at the counter. They had Brett seated on a wine-cask. It was dark in the wine-shop and full of men singing, hard-voiced singing. Back of the counter they drew the wine from casks. I put down money for the wine, but one of the men picked it up and put it back in my pocket.",0
8937,"“I want a leather wine-bottle,” Bill said. “There’s a place down the street,” I said. “I’ll go get a couple.”",0
8938,"The dancers did not want me to go out. Three of them were sitting on the high wine-cask beside Brett, teaching her to drink out of the wine-skins. They had hung a wreath of garlics around her neck. Some one insisted on giving her a glass. Somebody was teaching Bill a song. Singing it into his ear. Beating time on Bill’s back.",0
8939,"I explained to them that I would be back. Outside in the street I went down the street looking for the shop that made leather wine-bottles. The crowd was packed on the sidewalks and many of the shops were shuttered, and I could not find it. I walked as far as the church, looking on both sides of the street. Then I asked a man and he took me by the arm and led me to it. The shutters were up but the door was open.",0
8940,"Inside it smelled of fresh tanned leather and hot tar. A man was stencilling completed wine-skins. They hung from the roof in bunches. He took one down, blew it up, screwed the nozzle tight, and then jumped on it  “See!",0
8941,"It doesn’t leak.” “I want another one, too. A big one.”",0
8942,"He took down a big one that would hold a gallon or more, from the roof. He blew it up, his cheeks puffing ahead of the wine-skin, and stood on the bota holding on to a chair. “What are you going to do? Sell them in Bayonne?”  “No. Drink out of them.”",0
8943,He slapped me on the back. “Good man. Eight pesetas for the two. The lowest price.”,0
8944,"The man who was stencilling the new ones and tossing them into a pile stopped. “It’s true,” he said. “Eight pesetas is cheap.”  I paid and went out and along the street back to the wine-shop.",0
8945,"It was darker than ever inside and very crowded. I did not see Brett and Bill, and some one said they were in the back room. At the counter the girl filled the two wine-skins for me. One held two litres. The other held five litres. Filling them both cost three pesetas sixty centimos. Some one at the counter, that I had never seen before, tried to pay for the wine, but I finally paid for it myself. The man who had wanted to pay then bought me a drink. He would not let me buy one in return, but said he would take a rinse of the mouth from the new wine-bag. He tipped the big five-litre bag up and squeezed it so the wine hissed against the back of his throat.",0
8946,"“All right,” he said, and handed back the bag. In the back room Brett and Bill were sitting on barrels surrounded by the dancers. Everybody had his arms on everybody else’s shoulders, and they were all singing. Mike was sitting at a table with several men in their shirt-sleeves, eating from a bowl of tuna fish, chopped onions and vinegar. They were all drinking wine and mopping up the oil and vinegar with pieces of bread.",0
8947,"“Hello, Jake. Hello!” Mike called. “Come here. I want you to meet my friends. We’re all having an hors-d’œuvre.”",0
8948,"I was introduced to the people at the table. They supplied their names to Mike and sent for a fork for me. “Stop eating their dinner, Michael,” Brett shouted from the wine-barrels.",0
8949,"“I don’t want to eat up your meal,” I said when some one handed me a fork. “Eat,” he said. “What do you think it’s here for?”  I unscrewed the nozzle of the big wine-bottle and handed it around.",0
8950,"Every one took a drink, tipping the wine-skin at arm’s length. Outside, above the singing, we could hear the music of the procession going by. “Isn’t that the procession?” Mike asked.",0
8951,"“Nada,” some one said. “It’s nothing. Drink up. Lift the bottle.”",0
8952,"“Where did they find you?” I asked Mike. “Some one brought me here,” Mike said. “They said you were here.”",0
8953,"“Where’s Cohn?”  “He’s passed out,” Brett called. “They’ve put him away somewhere.” “Where is he?”  “I don’t know.”",0
8954,"“How should we know,” Bill said. “I think he’s dead.” “He’s not dead,” Mike said. “I know he’s not dead. He’s just passed out on Anis del Mono.”",0
8955,"As he said Anis del Mono one of the men at the table looked up, brought out a bottle from inside his smock, and handed it to me. “No,” I said. “No, thanks!”  “Yes.",0
8956,Yes. Arriba! Up with the bottle!”  I took a drink.,0
8957,"It tasted of licorice and warmed all the way. I could feel it warming in my stomach. “Where the hell is Cohn?”  “I don’t know,” Mike said.",0
8958,“I’ll ask. Where is the drunken comrade?” he asked in Spanish.,0
8959,"“You want to see him?”  “Yes,” I said. “Not me,” said Mike. “This gent.”",0
8960,The Anis del Mono man wiped his mouth and stood up. “Come on.” In a back room Robert Cohn was sleeping quietly on some wine-casks. It was almost too dark to see his face. They had covered him with a coat and another coat was folded under his head. Around his neck and on his chest was a big wreath of twisted garlics.,0
8961,"“Let him sleep,” the man whispered. “He’s all right.” Two hours later Cohn appeared. He came into the front room still with the wreath of garlics around his neck. The Spaniards shouted when he came in. Cohn wiped his eyes and grinned.",0
8962,"“I must have been sleeping,” he said. “Oh, not at all,” Brett said. “You were only dead,” Bill said.",0
8963,“Aren’t we going to go and have some supper?” Cohn asked. “Do you want to eat?”  “Yes.,0
8964,"Why not? I’m hungry.” “Eat those garlics, Robert,” Mike said. “I say. Do eat those garlics.”",0
8965,"Cohn stood there. His sleep had made him quite all right. “Do let’s go and eat,” Brett said. “I must get a bath.”  “Come on,” Bill said.",0
8966,“Let’s translate Brett to the hotel.” We said good-bye to many people and shook hands with many people and went out. Outside it was dark.,0
8967,"“What time is it do you suppose?” Cohn asked. “It’s to-morrow,” Mike said. “You’ve been asleep two days.”",0
8968,"“No,” said Cohn, “what time is it?”  “It’s ten o’clock.”  “What a lot we’ve drunk.” “You mean what a lot we’ve drunk. You went to sleep.”",0
8969,"Going down the dark streets to the hotel we saw the sky-rockets going up in the square. Down the side streets that led to the square we saw the square solid with people, those in the centre all dancing. It was a big meal at the hotel. It was the first meal of the prices being doubled for the fiesta, and there were several new courses. After the dinner we were out in the town. I remember resolving that I would stay up all night to watch the bulls go through the streets at six o’clock in the morning, and being so sleepy that I went to bed around four o’clock. The others stayed up.",0
8970,"My own room was locked and I could not find the key, so I went up-stairs and slept on one of the beds in Cohn’s room. The fiesta was going on outside in the night, but I was too sleepy for it to keep me awake. When I woke it was the sound of the rocket exploding that announced the release of the bulls from the corrals at the edge of town. They would race through the streets and out to the bull-ring. I had been sleeping heavily and I woke feeling I was too late. I put on a coat of Cohn’s and went out on the balcony. Down below the narrow street was empty. All the balconies were crowded with people. Suddenly a crowd came down the street. They were all running, packed close together. They passed along and up the street toward the bull-ring and behind them came more men running faster, and then some stragglers who were really running. Behind them was a little bare space, and then the bulls galloping, tossing their heads up and down. It all went out of sight around the corner. One man fell, rolled to the gutter, and lay quiet. But the bulls went right on and did not notice him. They were all running together.",0
8971,"After they went out of sight a great roar came from the bull-ring. It kept on. Then finally the pop of the rocket that meant the bulls had gotten through the people in the ring and into the corrals. I went back in the room and got into bed. I had been standing on the stone balcony in bare feet. I knew our crowd must have all been out at the bull-ring. Back in bed, I went to sleep.",0
8972,Cohn woke me when he came in. He started to undress and went over and closed the window because the people on the balcony of the house just across the street were looking in. “Did you see the show?” I asked.,0
8973,“Yes. We were all there.” “Anybody get hurt?”  “One of the bulls got into the crowd in the ring and tossed six or eight people.”,0
8974,“How did Brett like it?”  “It was all so sudden there wasn’t any time for it to bother anybody.” “I wish I’d been up.” “We didn’t know where you were. We went to your room but it was locked.”,0
8975,"“Where did you stay up?”  “We danced at some club.” “I got sleepy,” I said. “My gosh! I’m sleepy now,” Cohn said. “Doesn’t this thing ever stop?”  “Not for a week.”",0
8976,"Bill opened the door and put his head in. “Where were you, Jake?”  “I saw them go through from the balcony. How was it?”  “Grand.”  “Where you going?”  “To sleep.”",0
8977,"No one was up before noon. We ate at tables set out under the arcade. The town was full of people. We had to wait for a table. After lunch we went over to the Iruña. It had filled up, and as the time for the bull-fight came it got fuller, and the tables were crowded closer. There was a close, crowded hum that came every day before the bull-fight. The café did not make this same noise at any other time, no matter how crowded it was. This hum went on, and we were in it and a part of it.",0
8978,"I had taken six seats for all the fights. Three of them were barreras, the first row at the ring-side, and three were sobrepuertos, seats with wooden backs, half-way up the amphitheatre. Mike thought Brett had best sit high up for her first time, and Cohn wanted to sit with them. Bill and I were going to sit in the barreras, and I gave the extra ticket to a waiter to sell. Bill said something to Cohn about what to do and how to look so he would not mind the horses. Bill had seen one season of bull-fights.",0
8979,"“I’m not worried about how I’ll stand it. I’m only afraid I may be bored,” Cohn said. “You think so?”  “Don’t look at the horses, after the bull hits them,” I said to Brett.",0
8980,"“Watch the charge and see the picador try and keep the bull off, but then don’t look again until the horse is dead if it’s been hit.” “I’m a little nervy about it,” Brett said. “I’m worried whether I’ll be able to go through with it all right.”  “You’ll be all right.",0
8981,"There’s nothing but that horse part that will bother you, and they’re only in for a few minutes with each bull. Just don’t watch when it’s bad.” “She’ll be all right,” Mike said. “I’ll look after her.”",0
8982,"“I don’t think you’ll be bored,” Bill said. “I’m going over to the hotel to get the glasses and the wine-skin,” I said. “See you back here. Don’t get cock-eyed.”",0
8983,"“I’ll come along,” Bill said. Brett smiled at us. We walked around through the arcade to avoid the heat of the square.",0
8984,"“That Cohn gets me,” Bill said. “He’s got this Jewish superiority so strong that he thinks the only emotion he’ll get out of the fight will be being bored.” “We’ll watch him with the glasses,” I said.",0
8985,"“Oh, to hell with him!”  “He spends a lot of time there.” “I want him to stay there.” In the hotel on the stairs we met Montoya.  “Come on,” said Montoya.",0
8986,"“Do you want to meet Pedro Romero?”  “Fine,” said Bill. “Let’s go see him.” We followed Montoya up a flight and down the corridor.",0
8987,"“He’s in room number eight,” Montoya explained. “He’s getting dressed for the bull-fight.” Montoya knocked on the door and opened it. It was a gloomy room with a little light coming in from the window on the narrow street. There were two beds separated by a monastic partition. The electric light was on. The boy stood very straight and unsmiling in his bull-fighting clothes. His jacket hung over the back of a chair. They were just finishing winding his sash. His black hair shone under the electric light. He wore a white linen shirt and the sword-handler finished his sash and stood up and stepped back. Pedro Romero nodded, seeming very far away and dignified when we shook hands. Montoya said something about what great aficionados we were, and that we wanted to wish him luck. Romero listened very seriously. Then he turned to me. He was the best-looking boy I have ever seen.",0
8988,"“You go to the bull-fight,” he said in English. “You know English,” I said, feeling like an idiot. “No,” he answered, and smiled.",0
8989,One of three men who had been sitting on the beds came up and asked us if we spoke French. “Would you like me to interpret for you? Is there anything you would like to ask Pedro Romero?”  We thanked him.,0
8990,"What was there that you would like to ask? The boy was nineteen years old, alone except for his sword-handler, and the three hangers-on, and the bull-fight was to commence in twenty minutes. We wished him “Mucha suerte,” shook hands, and went out. He was standing, straight and handsome and altogether by himself, alone in the room with the hangers-on as we shut the door.",0
8991,"“He’s a fine boy, don’t you think so?” Montoya asked. “He’s a good-looking kid,” I said.",0
8992,"“He looks like a torero,” Montoya said. “He has the type.” “He’s a fine boy.”",0
8993,"“We’ll see how he is in the ring,” Montoya said. We found the big leather wine-bottle leaning against the wall in my room, took it and the field-glasses, locked the door, and went down-stairs. It was a good bull-fight. Bill and I were very excited about Pedro Romero. Montoya was sitting about ten places away. After Romero had killed his first bull Montoya caught my eye and nodded his head. This was a real one. There had not been a real one for a long time. Of the other two matadors, one was very fair and the other was passable. But there was no comparison with Romero, although neither of his bulls was much.",0
8994,"Several times during the bull-fight I looked up at Mike and Brett and Cohn, with the glasses. They seemed to be all right. Brett did not look upset. All three were leaning forward on the concrete railing in front of them.",0
8995,"“Let me take the glasses,” Bill said. “Does Cohn look bored?” I asked.",0
8996,"“That kike!”  Outside the ring, after the bull-fight was over, you could not move in the crowd. We could not make our way through but had to be moved with the whole thing, slowly, as a glacier, back to town. We had that disturbed emotional feeling that always comes after a bull-fight, and the feeling of elation that comes after a good bull-fight. The fiesta was going on. The drums pounded and the pipe music was shrill, and everywhere the flow of the crowd was broken by patches of dancers. The dancers were in a crowd, so you did not see the intricate play of the feet. All you saw was the heads and shoulders going up and down, up and down. Finally, we got out of the crowd and made for the café. The waiter saved chairs for the others, and we each ordered an absinthe and watched the crowd in the square and the dancers.",0
8997,“What do you suppose that dance is?” Bill asked. “It’s a sort of jota.”,0
8998,"“They’re not all the same,” Bill said. “They dance differently to all the different tunes.” “It’s swell dancing.”",0
8999,In front of us on a clear part of the street a company of boys were dancing. The steps were very intricate and their faces were intent and concentrated. They all looked down while they danced. Their rope-soled shoes tapped and spatted on the pavement. The toes touched. The heels touched. The balls of the feet touched. Then the music broke wildly and the step was finished and they were all dancing on up the street.,0
9000,"“Here come the gentry,” Bill said. They were crossing the street  “Hello, men,” I said. “Hello, gents!” said Brett. “You saved us seats? How nice.”  “I say,” Mike said, “that Romero what’shisname is somebody.",0
9001,"Am I wrong?”  “Oh, isn’t he lovely,” Brett said. “And those green trousers.”  “Brett never took her eyes off them.” “I say, I must borrow your glasses to-morrow.”",0
9002,"“How did it go?”  “Wonderfully! Simply perfect. I say, it is a spectacle!”  “How about the horses?”  “I couldn’t help looking at them.”",0
9003,"“She couldn’t take her eyes off them,” Mike said. “She’s an extraordinary wench.” “They do have some rather awful things happen to them,” Brett said. “I couldn’t look away, though.”",0
9004,"“Did you feel all right?”  “I didn’t feel badly at all.”  “Robert Cohn did,” Mike put in. “You were quite green, Robert.” “The first horse did bother me,” Cohn said.",0
9005,"“You weren’t bored, were you?” asked Bill. Cohn laughed.",0
9006,"“No. I wasn’t bored. I wish you’d forgive me that.” “It’s all right,” Bill said, “so long as you weren’t bored.”  “He didn’t look bored,” Mike said.",0
9007,“I thought he was going to be sick.” “I never felt that bad. It was just for a minute.”,0
9008,"“I thought he was going to be sick. You weren’t bored, were you, Robert?”  “Let up on that, Mike. I said I was sorry I said it.”",0
9009,"“He was, you know. He was positively green.” “Oh, shove it along, Michael.”",0
9010,"“You mustn’t ever get bored at your first bull-fight, Robert,” Mike said. “It might make such a mess.” “Oh, shove it along, Michael,” Brett said.",0
9011,"“He said Brett was a sadist,” Mike said. “Brett’s not a sadist. She’s just a lovely, healthy wench.”  “Are you a sadist, Brett?”",0
9012,"I asked. “Hope not.” “He said Brett was a sadist just because she has a good, healthy stomach.”  “Won’t be healthy long.”",0
9013,"Bill got Mike started on something else than Cohn. The waiter brought the absinthe glasses. “Did you really like it?” Bill asked Cohn.  “No, I can’t say I liked it.",0
9014,"I think it’s a wonderful show.”  “Gad, yes! What a spectacle!” Brett said.",0
9015,"“I wish they didn’t have the horse part,” Cohn said. “They’re not important,” Bill said. “After a while you never notice anything disgusting.”",0
9016,"“It is a bit strong just at the start,” Brett said. “There’s a dreadful moment for me just when the bull starts for the horse.” “The bulls were fine,” Cohn said.",0
9017,"“They were very good,” Mike said. “I want to sit down below, next time.” Brett drank from her glass of absinthe.",0
9018,"“She wants to see the bull-fighters close by,” Mike said. “They are something,” Brett said. “That Romero lad is just a child.”",0
9019,"“He’s a damned good-looking boy,” I said. “When we were up in his room I never saw a better-looking kid.” “How old do you suppose he is?”  “Nineteen or twenty.”  “Just imagine it.”",0
9020,"The bull-fight on the second day was much better than on the first. Brett sat between Mike and me at the barrera, and Bill and Cohn went up above. Romero was the whole show. I do not think Brett saw any other bull-fighter. No one else did either, except the hard-shelled technicians. It was all Romero. There were two other matadors, but they did not count. I sat beside Brett and explained to Brett what it was all about. I told her about watching the bull, not the horse, when the bulls charged the picadors, and got her to watching the picador place the point of his pic so that she saw what it was all about, so that it became more something that was going on with a definite end, and less of a spectacle with unexplained horrors. I had her watch how Romero took the bull away from a fallen horse with his cape, and how he held him with the cape and turned him, smoothly and suavely, never wasting the bull. She saw how Romero avoided every brusque movement and saved his bulls for the last when he wanted them, not winded and discomposed but smoothly worn down. She saw how close Romero always worked to the bull, and I pointed out to her the tricks the other bull-fighters used to make it look as though they were working closely. She saw why she liked Romero’s cape-work and why she did not like the others.",0
9021,"Romero never made any contortions, always it was straight and pure and natural in line. The others twisted themselves like corkscrews, their elbows raised, and leaned against the flanks of the bull after his horns had passed, to give a faked look of danger. Afterward, all that was faked turned bad and gave an unpleasant feeling. Romero’s bull-fighting gave real emotion, because he kept the absolute purity of line in his movements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass him close each time. He did not have to emphasize their closeness. Brett saw how something that was beautiful done close to the bull was ridiculous if it were done a little way off. I told her how since the death of Joselito all the bull-fighters had been developing a technic that simulated this appearance of danger in order to give a fake emotional feeling, while the bull-fighter was really safe. Romero had the old thing, the holding of his purity of line through the maximum of exposure, while he dominated the bull by making him realize he was unattainable, while he prepared him for the killing.",0
9022,"“I’ve never seen him do an awkward thing,” Brett said. “You won’t until he gets frightened,” I said. “He’ll never be frightened,” Mike said. “He knows too damned much.”",0
9023,"“He knew everything when he started. The others can’t ever learn what he was born with.” “And God, what looks,” Brett said.",0
9024,"“I believe, you know, that she’s falling in love with this bull-fighter chap,” Mike said. “I wouldn’t be surprised.” “Be a good chap, Jake. Don’t tell her anything more about him. Tell her how they beat their old mothers.”",0
9025,"“Tell me what drunks they are.” “Oh, frightful,” Mike said. “Drunk all day and spend all their time beating their poor old mothers.”  “He looks that way,” Brett said.",0
9026,"“Doesn’t he?” I said. They had hitched the mules to the dead bull and then the whips cracked, the men ran, and the mules, straining forward, their legs pushing, broke into a gallop, and the bull, one horn up, his head on its side, swept a swath smoothly across the sand and out the red gate.",0
9027,"“This next is the last one.” “Not really,” Brett said. She leaned forward on the barrera. Romero waved his picadors to their places, then stood, his cape against his chest, looking across the ring to where the bull would come out.",0
9028,"After it was over we went out and were pressed tight in the crowd. “These bull-fights are hell on one,” Brett said. “I’m limp as a rag.”",0
9029,"“Oh, you’ll get a drink,” Mike said. The next day Pedro Romero did not fight. It was Miura bulls, and a very bad bull-fight. The next day there was no bull-fight scheduled. But all day and all night the fiesta kept on.",0
9030,"CHAPTER 16 In the morning it was raining. A fog had come over the mountains from the sea. You could not see the tops of the mountains. The plateau was dull and gloomy, and the shapes of the trees and the houses were changed. I walked out beyond the town to look at the weather. The bad weather was coming over the mountains from the sea.",0
9031,"The flags in the square hung wet from the white poles and the banners were wet and hung damp against the front of the houses, and in between the steady drizzle the rain came down and drove every one under the arcades and made pools of water in the square, and the streets wet and dark and deserted; yet the fiesta kept up without any pause. It was only driven under cover. The covered seats of the bull-ring had been crowded with people sitting out of the rain watching the concourse of Basque and Navarrais dancers and singers, and afterward the Val Carlos dancers in their costumes danced down the street in the rain, the drums sounding hollow and damp, and the chiefs of the bands riding ahead on their big, heavy-footed horses, their costumes wet, the horses’ coats wet in the rain. The crowd was in the cafés and the dancers came in, too, and sat, their tight-wound white legs under the tables, shaking the water from their belled caps, and spreading their red and purple jackets over the chairs to dry. It was raining hard outside.",0
9032,"I left the crowd in the café and went over to the hotel to get shaved for dinner. I was shaving in my room when there was a knock on the door. “Come in,” I called.",0
9033,Montoya walked in. “How are you?” he said.,0
9034,"“Fine,” I said. “No bulls to-day.” “No,” I said, “nothing but rain.”  “Where are your friends?”  “Over at the Iruña.”",0
9035,"Montoya smiled his embarrassed smile. “Look,” he said. “Do you know the American ambassador?”  “Yes,” I said.",0
9036,"“Everybody knows the American ambassador.” “He’s here in town, now.” “Yes,” I said. “Everybody’s seen them.”",0
9037,"“I’ve seen them, too,” Montoya said. He didn’t say anything. I went on shaving.",0
9038,"“Sit down,” I said. “Let me send for a drink.” “No, I have to go.”",0
9039,"I finished shaving and put my face down into the bowl and washed it with cold water. Montoya was standing there looking more embarrassed. “Look,” he said. “I’ve just had a message from them at the Grand Hotel that they want Pedro Romero and Marcial Lalanda to come over for coffee to-night after dinner.”",0
9040,"“Well,” I said, “it can’t hurt Marcial any.” “Marcial has been in San Sebastian all day. He drove over in a car this morning with Marquez. I don’t think they’ll be back to-night.”",0
9041,"Montoya stood embarrassed. He wanted me to say something. “Don’t give Romero the message,” I said.",0
9042,"“You think so?”  “Absolutely.” Montoya was very pleased. “I wanted to ask you because you were an American,” he said.",0
9043,"“That’s what I’d do.”  “Look,” said Montoya. “People take a boy like that. They don’t know what he’s worth. They don’t know what he means. Any foreigner can flatter him. They start this Grand Hotel business, and in one year they’re through.”  “Like Algabeno,” I said.",0
9044,"“Yes, like Algabeno.”  “They’re a fine lot,” I said. “There’s one American woman down here now that collects bull-fighters.” “I know. They only want the young ones.”",0
9045,"“Yes,” I said. “The old ones get fat.” “Or crazy like Gallo.”",0
9046,"“Well,” I said, “it’s easy. All you have to do is not give him the message.” “He’s such a fine boy,” said Montoya. “He ought to stay with his own people. He shouldn’t mix in that stuff.”",0
9047,"“Won’t you have a drink?” I asked. “No,” said Montoya, “I have to go.” He went out.",0
9048,"I went down-stairs and out the door and took a walk around through the arcades around the square. It was still raining. I looked in at the Iruña for the gang and they were not there, so I walked on around the square and back to the hotel. They were eating dinner in the down-stairs dining-room.",0
9049,They were well ahead of me and it was no use trying to catch them. Bill was buying shoe-shines for Mike. Bootblacks opened the street door and each one Bill called over and started to work on Mike.,0
9050,"“This is the eleventh time my boots have been polished,” Mike said. “I say, Bill is an ass.” The bootblacks had evidently spread the report. Another came in.",0
9051,"“Limpia botas?” he said to Bill. “No,” said Bill. “For this Señor.”",0
9052,"The bootblack knelt down beside the one at work and started on Mike’s free shoe that shone already in the electric light. “Bill’s a yell of laughter,” Mike said. I was drinking red wine, and so far behind them that I felt a little uncomfortable about all this shoe-shining. I looked around the room. At the next table was Pedro Romero. He stood up when I nodded, and asked me to come over and meet a friend. His table was beside ours, almost touching. I met the friend, a Madrid bull-fight critic, a little man with a drawn face. I told Romero how much I liked his work, and he was very pleased. We talked Spanish and the critic knew a little French. I reached to our table for my wine-bottle, but the critic took my arm. Romero laughed.",0
9053,"“Drink here,” he said in English. He was very bashful about his English, but he was really very pleased with it, and as we went on talking he brought out words he was not sure of, and asked me about them. He was anxious to know the English for Corrida de toros, the exact translation. Bull-fight he was suspicious of. I explained that bull-fight in Spanish was the lidia of a toro. The Spanish word corrida means in English the running of bulls—the French translation is Course de taureaux. The critic put that in. There is no Spanish word for bull-fight.",0
9054,"Pedro Romero said he had learned a little English in Gibraltar. He was born in Ronda. That is not far above Gibraltar. He started bull-fighting in Malaga in the bull-fighting school there. He had only been at it three years. The bull-fight critic joked him about the number of Malagueño expressions he used. He was nineteen years old, he said. His older brother was with him as a banderillero, but he did not live in this hotel. He lived in a smaller hotel with the other people who worked for Romero. He asked me how many times I had seen him in the ring. I told him only three. It was really only two, but I did not want to explain after I had made the mistake.",0
9055,"“Where did you see me the other time? In Madrid?”  “Yes,” I lied. I had read the accounts of his two appearances in Madrid in the bull-fight papers, so I was all right.",0
9056,"“The first or the second time?”  “The first.”  “I was very bad,” he said. “The second time I was better. You remember?” He turned to the critic.",0
9057,He was not at all embarrassed. He talked of his work as something altogether apart from himself. There was nothing conceited or braggartly about him.,0
9058,"“I like it very much that you like my work,” he said. “But you haven’t seen it yet. To-morrow, if I get a good bull, I will try and show it to you.”",0
9059,"When he said this he smiled, anxious that neither the bull-fight critic nor I would think he was boasting. “I am anxious to see it,” the critic said. “I would like to be convinced.”",0
9060,“He doesn’t like my work much.” Romero turned to me. He was serious.,0
9061,"The critic explained that he liked it very much, but that so far it had been incomplete. “Wait till to-morrow, if a good one comes out.” “Have you seen the bulls for to-morrow?” the critic asked me.",0
9062,"“Yes. I saw them unloaded.”  Pedro Romero leaned forward. “What did you think of them?”  “Very nice,” I said.",0
9063,"“About twenty-six arrobas. Very short horns. Haven’t you seen them?”  “Oh, yes,” said Romero.",0
9064,"“They won’t weigh twenty-six arrobas,” said the critic. “No,” said Romero. “They’ve got bananas for horns,” the critic said.",0
9065,"“You call them bananas?” asked Romero. He turned to me and smiled. “You wouldn’t call them bananas?”  “No,” I said.",0
9066,"“They’re horns all right.” “They’re very short,” said Pedro Romero. “Very, very short. Still, they aren’t bananas.”",0
9067,"“I say, Jake,” Brett called from the next table, “you have deserted us.” “Just temporarily,” I said. “We’re talking bulls.”",0
9068,"“You are superior.” “Tell him that bulls have no balls,” Mike shouted. He was drunk.",0
9069,"Romero looked at me inquiringly. “Drunk,” I said. “Borracho! Muy borracho!”  “You might introduce your friends,” Brett said.",0
9070,She had not stopped looking at Pedro Romero. I asked them if they would like to have coffee with us. They both stood up. Romero’s face was very brown. He had very nice manners.,0
9071,"I introduced them all around and they started to sit down, but there was not enough room, so we all moved over to the big table by the wall to have coffee. Mike ordered a bottle of Fundador and glasses for everybody. There was a lot of drunken talking.",0
9072,"“Tell him I think writing is lousy,” Bill said. “Go on, tell him. Tell him I’m ashamed of being a writer.”",0
9073,Pedro Romero was sitting beside Brett and listening to her. “Go on. Tell him!” Bill said.,0
9074,"Romero looked up smiling. “This gentleman,” I said, “is a writer.” Romero was impressed. “This other one, too,” I said, pointing at Cohn.  “He looks like Villalta,” Romero said, looking at Bill.",0
9075,"“Rafael, doesn’t he look like Villalta?”  “I can’t see it,” the critic said. “Really,” Romero said in Spanish. “He looks a lot like Villalta. What does the drunken one do?”  “Nothing.”  “Is that why he drinks?”  “No.",0
9076,"He’s waiting to marry this lady.” “Tell him bulls have no balls!” Mike shouted, very drunk, from the other end of the table.",0
9077,"“What does he say?”  “He’s drunk.” “Jake,” Mike called. “Tell him bulls have no balls!”  “You understand?”",0
9078,"I said. “Yes.”  I was sure he didn’t, so it was all right. “Tell him Brett wants to see him put on those green pants.”  “Pipe down, Mike.”  “Tell him Brett is dying to know how he can get into those pants.”  “Pipe down.”",0
9079,"During this Romero was fingering his glass and talking with Brett. Brett was talking French and he was talking Spanish and a little English, and laughing.",0
9080,"Bill was filling the glasses. “Tell him Brett wants to come into——”  “Oh, pipe down, Mike, for Christ’s sake!”  Romero looked up smiling. “Pipe down! I know that,” he said.",0
9081,"Just then Montoya came into the room. He started to smile at me, then he saw Pedro Romero with a big glass of cognac in his hand, sitting laughing between me and a woman with bare shoulders, at a table full of drunks. He did not even nod.",0
9082,"Montoya went out of the room. Mike was on his feet proposing a toast. “Let’s all drink to—” he began. “Pedro Romero,” I said. Everybody stood up. Romero took it very seriously, and we touched glasses and drank it down, I rushing it a little because Mike was trying to make it clear that that was not at all what he was going to drink to. But it went off all right, and Pedro Romero shook hands with every one and he and the critic went out together.",0
9083,"“My God! he’s a lovely boy,” Brett said. “And how I would love to see him get into those clothes. He must use a shoe-horn.”",0
9084,"“I started to tell him,” Mike began. “And Jake kept interrupting me. Why do you interrupt me? Do you think you talk Spanish better than I do?”  “Oh, shut up, Mike!",0
9085,"Nobody interrupted you.” “No, I’d like to get this settled.” He turned away from me. “Do you think you amount to something, Cohn? Do you think you belong here among us? People who are out to have a good time? For God’s sake don’t be so noisy, Cohn!”",0
9086,"“Oh, cut it out, Mike,” Cohn said. “Do you think Brett wants you here? Do you think you add to the party? Why don’t you say something?”  “I said all I had to say the other night, Mike.”",0
9087,"“I’m not one of you literary chaps.” Mike stood shakily and leaned against the table. “I’m not clever. But I do know when I’m not wanted. Why don’t you see when you’re not wanted, Cohn? Go away. Go away, for God’s sake. Take that sad Jewish face away. Don’t you think I’m right?”  He looked at us.",0
9088,"“Sure,” I said. “Let’s all go over to the Iruña.”  “No. Don’t you think I’m right? I love that woman.”",0
9089,"“Oh, don’t start that again. Do shove it along, Michael,” Brett said. “Don’t you think I’m right, Jake?”  Cohn still sat at the table.",0
9090,"His face had the sallow, yellow look it got when he was insulted, but somehow he seemed to be enjoying it. The childish, drunken heroics of it. It was his affair with a lady of title.",0
9091,"“Jake,” Mike said. He was almost crying. “You know I’m right. Listen, you!” He turned to Cohn: “Go away! Go away now!”",0
9092,"“But I won’t go, Mike,” said Cohn. “Then I’ll make you!” Mike started toward him around the table. Cohn stood up and took off his glasses. He stood waiting, his face sallow, his hands fairly low, proudly and firmly waiting for the assault, ready to do battle for his lady love.",0
9093,"I grabbed Mike. “Come on to the café,” I said. “You can’t hit him here in the hotel.”",0
9094,“Good!” said Mike. “Good idea!” We started off. I looked back as Mike stumbled up the stairs and saw Cohn putting his glasses on again. Bill was sitting at the table pouring another glass of Fundador. Brett was sitting looking straight ahead at nothing.,0
9095,"Outside on the square it had stopped raining and the moon was trying to get through the clouds. There was a wind blowing. The military band was playing and the crowd was massed on the far side of the square where the fireworks specialist and his son were trying to send up fire balloons. A balloon would start up jerkily, on a great bias, and be torn by the wind or blown against the houses of the square. Some fell into the crowd. The magnesium flared and the fireworks exploded and chased about in the crowd. There was no one dancing in the square. The gravel was too wet.",0
9096,"Brett came out with Bill and joined us. We stood in the crowd and watched Don Manuel Orquito, the fireworks king, standing on a little platform, carefully starting the balloons with sticks, standing above the heads of the crowd to launch the balloons off into the wind. The wind brought them all down, and Don Manuel Orquito’s face was sweaty in the light of his complicated fireworks that fell into the crowd and charged and chased, sputtering and cracking, between the legs of the people. The people shouted as each new luminous paper bubble careened, caught fire, and fell.",0
9097,"“They’re razzing Don Manuel,” Bill said. “How do you know he’s Don Manuel?” Brett said.",0
9098,"“His name’s on the programme. Don Manuel Orquito, the pirotecnico of esta ciudad.”  “Globos illuminados,” Mike said. “A collection of globos illuminados. That’s what the paper said.”",0
9099,"The wind blew the band music away. “I say, I wish one would go up,” Brett said. “That Don Manuel chap is furious.”",0
9100,"“He’s probably worked for weeks fixing them to go off, spelling out ‘Hail to San Fermin,’ ” Bill said. “Globos illuminados,” Mike said. “A bunch of bloody globos illuminados.”  “Come on,” said Brett.",0
9101,"“We can’t stand here.” “Her ladyship wants a drink,” Mike said. “How you know things,” Brett said.",0
9102,"Inside, the café was crowded and very noisy. No one noticed us come in. We could not find a table. There was a great noise going on.",0
9103,"“Come on, let’s get out of here,” Bill said. Outside the paseo was going in under the arcade. There were some English and Americans from Biarritz in sport clothes scattered at the tables. Some of the women stared at the people going by with lorgnons. We had acquired, at some time, a friend of Bill’s from Biarritz. She was staying with another girl at the Grand Hotel. The other girl had a headache and had gone to bed.",0
9104,"“Here’s the pub,” Mike said. It was the Bar Milano, a small, tough bar where you could get food and where they danced in the back room. We all sat down at a table and ordered a bottle of Fundador. The bar was not full. There was nothing going on.",0
9105,"“This is a hell of a place,” Bill said. “It’s too early.” “Let’s take the bottle and come back later,” Bill said. “I don’t want to sit here on a night like this.”  “Let’s go and look at the English,” Mike said.",0
9106,"“I love to look at the English.” “They’re awful,” Bill said. “Where did they all come from?”  “They come from Biarritz,” Mike said, “They come to see the last day of the quaint little Spanish fiesta.”",0
9107,"“I’ll festa them,” Bill said. “You’re an extraordinarily beautiful girl.” Mike turned to Bill’s friend. “When did you come here?”  “Come off it, Michael.”",0
9108,"“I say, she is a lovely girl. Where have I been? Where have I been looking all this while? You’re a lovely thing. Have we met? Come along with me and Bill. We’re going to festa the English.”",0
9109,"“I’ll festa them,” Bill said, “What the hell are they doing at this fiesta?”  “Come on,” Mike said. “Just us three. We’re going to festa the bloody English. I hope you’re not English? I’m Scotch. I hate the English. I’m going to festa them. Come on, Bill.”",0
9110,"Through the window we saw them, all three arm in arm, going toward the café. Rockets were going up in the square. “I’m going to sit here,” Brett said.",0
9111,"“I’ll stay with you,” Cohn said. “Oh, don’t!” Brett said. “For God’s sake, go off somewhere. Can’t you see Jake and I want to talk?”  “I didn’t,” Cohn said.",0
9112,"“I thought I’d sit here because I felt a little tight.”  “What a hell of a reason for sitting with any one. If you’re tight, go to bed. Go on to bed.”",0
9113,“Was I rude enough to him?” Brett asked. Cohn was gone. “My God! I’m so sick of him!”,0
9114,“He doesn’t add much to the gayety.” “He depresses me so.” “He’s behaved very badly.”  “Damned badly.,0
9115,He had a chance to behave so well.” “He’s probably waiting just outside the door now.” “Yes. He would. You know I do know how he feels. He can’t believe it didn’t mean anything.”,0
9116,"“I know.” “Nobody else would behave as badly. Oh, I’m so sick of the whole thing. And Michael. Michael’s been lovely, too.”",0
9117,“It’s been damned hard on Mike.” “Yes. But he didn’t need to be a swine.”,0
9118,"“Everybody behaves badly,” I said. “Give them the proper chance.” “You wouldn’t behave badly.” Brett looked at me.",0
9119,"“I’d be as big an ass as Cohn,” I said. “Darling, don’t let’s talk a lot of rot.”  “All right. Talk about anything you like.”  “Don’t be difficult.",0
9120,"You’re the only person I’ve got, and I feel rather awful to-night.” “You’ve got Mike.” “Yes, Mike. Hasn’t he been pretty?”  “Well,” I said, “it’s been damned hard on Mike, having Cohn around and seeing him with you.”  “Don’t I know it, darling?",0
9121,Please don’t make me feel any worse than I do.” Brett was nervous as I had never seen her before. She kept looking away from me and looking ahead at the wall.,0
9122,"“Want to go for a walk?”  “Yes. Come on.” I corked up the Fundador bottle and gave it to the bartender. “Let’s have one more drink of that,” Brett said. “My nerves are rotten.”",0
9123,"We each drank a glass of the smooth amontillado brandy. “Come on,” said Brett. As we came out the door I saw Cohn walk out from under the arcade.",0
9124,"“He was there,” Brett said. “He can’t be away from you.”  “Poor devil!” “I’m not sorry for him. I hate him, myself.”",0
9125,"“I hate him, too,” she shivered. “I hate his damned suffering.” We walked arm in arm down the side street away from the crowd and the lights of the square. The street was dark and wet, and we walked along it to the fortifications at the edge of town. We passed wine-shops with light coming out from their doors onto the black, wet street, and sudden bursts of music.",0
9126,"“Want to go in?”  “No.”  We walked out across the wet grass and onto the stone wall of the fortifications. I spread a newspaper on the stone and Brett sat down. Across the plain it was dark, and we could see the mountains. The wind was high up and took the clouds across the moon. Below us were the dark pits of the fortifications. Behind were the trees and the shadow of the cathedral, and the town silhouetted against the moon.",0
9127,"“Don’t feel bad,” I said. “I feel like hell,” Brett said. “Don’t let’s talk.”",0
9128,"We looked out at the plain. The long lines of trees were dark in the moonlight. There were the lights of a car on the road climbing the mountain. Up on the top of the mountain we saw the lights of the fort. Below to the left was the river. It was high from the rain, and black and smooth. Trees were dark along the banks. We sat and looked out. Brett stared straight ahead. Suddenly she shivered.",0
9129,“It’s cold.”  “Want to walk back?”  “Through the park.” We climbed down. It was clouding over again. In the park it was dark under the trees.,0
9130,"“Do you still love me, Jake?”  “Yes,” I said. “Because I’m a goner,” Brett said. “How?”  “I’m a goner.",0
9131,"I’m mad about the Romero boy. I’m in love with him, I think.” “I wouldn’t be if I were you.”",0
9132,“I can’t help it. I’m a goner. It’s tearing me all up inside.”  “Don’t do it.”,0
9133,“I can’t help it. I’ve never been able to help anything.” “You ought to stop it.”,0
9134,“How can I stop it? I can’t stop things. Feel that?”  Her hand was trembling.,0
9135,"“I’m like that all through.” “You oughtn’t to do it.” “I can’t help it. I’m a goner now, anyway. Don’t you see the difference?”  “No.”  “I’ve got to do something.",0
9136,I’ve got to do something I really want to do. I’ve lost my self-respect.” “You don’t have to do that.”,0
9137,"“Oh, darling, don’t be difficult. What do you think it’s meant to have that damned Jew about, and Mike the way he’s acted?”  “Sure.”  “I can’t just stay tight all the time.” “No.”  “Oh, darling, please stay by me.",0
9138,"Please stay by me and see me through this.”  “Sure.”  “I don’t say it’s right. It is right though for me. God knows, I’ve never felt such a bitch.”",0
9139,"“What do you want me to do?”  “Come on,” Brett said. “Let’s go and find him.” Together we walked down the gravel path in the park in the dark, under the trees and then out from under the trees and past the gate into the street that led into town.",0
9140,Pedro Romero was in the café. He was at a table with other bull-fighters and bull-fight critics. They were smoking cigars. When we came in they looked up. Romero smiled and bowed. We sat down at a table half-way down the room.,0
9141,“Ask him to come over and have a drink.”  “Not yet. He’ll come over.” “I can’t look at him.”,0
9142,"“He’s nice to look at,” I said. “I’ve always done just what I wanted.” “I know.”",0
9143,"“I do feel such a bitch.” “Well,” I said. “My God!” said Brett, “the things a woman goes through.”  “Yes?”  “Oh, I do feel such a bitch.”",0
9144,"I looked across at the table. Pedro Romero smiled. He said something to the other people at his table, and stood up. He came over to our table. I stood up and we shook hands.",0
9145,"“Won’t you have a drink?”  “You must have a drink with me,” he said. He seated himself, asking Brett’s permission without saying anything. He had very nice manners. But he kept on smoking his cigar. It went well with his face.",0
9146,"“You like cigars?” I asked. “Oh, yes. I always smoke cigars.”",0
9147,"It was part of his system of authority. It made him seem older. I noticed his skin. It was clear and smooth and very brown. There was a triangular scar on his cheek-bone. I saw he was watching Brett. He felt there was something between them. He must have felt it when Brett gave him her hand. He was being very careful. I think he was sure, but he did not want to make any mistake.",0
9148,"“You fight to-morrow?” I said. “Yes,” he said. “Algabeno was hurt to-day in Madrid. Did you hear?”  “No,” I said.",0
9149,"“Badly?”  He shook his head. “Nothing. Here,” he showed his hand. Brett reached out and spread the fingers apart.",0
9150,"“Oh!” he said in English, “you tell fortunes?”  “Sometimes. Do you mind?”  “No. I like it.” He spread his hand flat on the table. “Tell me I live for always, and be a millionaire.”",0
9151,"He was still very polite, but he was surer of himself. “Look,” he said, “do you see any bulls in my hand?”  He laughed. His hand was very fine and the wrist was small.",0
9152,"“There are thousands of bulls,” Brett said. She was not at all nervous now. She looked lovely.",0
9153,"“Good,” Romero laughed. “At a thousand duros apiece,” he said to me in Spanish. “Tell me some more.”",0
9154,"“It’s a good hand,” Brett said. “I think he’ll live a long time.” “Say it to me. Not to your friend.”",0
9155,"“I said you’d live a long time.” “I know it,” Romero said. “I’m never going to die.”",0
9156,I tapped with my finger-tips on the table. Romero saw it. He shook his head.,0
9157,“No. Don’t do that. The bulls are my best friends.” I translated to Brett.,0
9158,"“You kill your friends?” she asked. “Always,” he said in English, and laughed. “So they don’t kill me.” He looked at her across the table.",0
9159,"“You know English well.” “Yes,” he said. “Pretty well, sometimes. But I must not let anybody know. It would be very bad, a torero who speaks English.”",0
9160,“Why?” asked Brett. “It would be bad. The people would not like it. Not yet.”  “Why not?”  “They would not like it.,0
9161,"Bull-fighters are not like that.” “What are bull-fighters like?”  He laughed and tipped his hat down over his eyes and changed the angle of his cigar and the expression of his face. “Like at the table,” he said. I glanced over. He had mimicked exactly the expression of Nacional. He smiled, his face natural again. “No. I must forget English.”  “Don’t forget it, yet,” Brett said.",0
9162,"“No?”  “No.”  “All right.” He laughed again. “I would like a hat like that,” Brett said.",0
9163,“Good. I’ll get you one.” “Right. See that you do.”,0
9164,"“I will. I’ll get you one to-night.” I stood up. Romero rose, too.",0
9165,"“Sit down,” I said. “I must go and find our friends and bring them here.” He looked at me. It was a final look to ask if it were understood. It was understood all right.",0
9166,"“Sit down,” Brett said to him. “You must teach me Spanish.” He sat down and looked at her across the table. I went out. The hard-eyed people at the bull-fighter table watched me go. It was not pleasant. When I came back and looked in the café, twenty minutes later, Brett and Pedro Romero were gone. The coffee-glasses and our three empty cognac-glasses were on the table. A waiter came with a cloth and picked up the glasses and mopped off the table.",0
9167,"CHAPTER 17 Outside the Bar Milano I found Bill and Mike and Edna. Edna was the girl’s name. “We’ve been thrown out,” Edna said.",0
9168,"“By the police,” said Mike. “There’s some people in there that don’t like me.” “I’ve kept them out of four fights,” Edna said. “You’ve got to help me.”",0
9169,"Bill’s face was red. “Come back in, Edna,” he said. “Go on in there and dance with Mike.”",0
9170,"“It’s silly,” Edna said. “There’ll just be another row.”  “Damned Biarritz swine,” Bill said. “Come on,” Mike said. “After all, it’s a pub. They can’t occupy a whole pub.”",0
9171,"“Good old Mike,” Bill said. “Damned English swine come here and insult Mike and try and spoil the fiesta.” “They’re so bloody,” Mike said. “I hate the English.”",0
9172,"“They can’t insult Mike,” Bill said. “Mike is a swell fellow. They can’t insult Mike. I won’t stand it. Who cares if he is a damn bankrupt?” His voice broke.",0
9173,"“Who cares?” Mike said. “I don’t care. Jake doesn’t care. Do you care?”  “No,” Edna said.",0
9174,"“Are you a bankrupt?”  “Of course I am. You don’t care, do you, Bill?” Bill put his arm around Mike’s shoulder.",0
9175,“I wish to hell I was a bankrupt. I’d show those bastards.”,0
9176,"“They’re just English,” Mike said. “It never makes any difference what the English say.” “The dirty swine,” Bill said. “I’m going to clean them out.”",0
9177,"“Bill,” Edna looked at me. “Please don’t go in again, Bill. They’re so stupid.”",0
9178,"“That’s it,” said Mike. “They’re stupid. I knew that was what it was.”",0
9179,"“They can’t say things like that about Mike,” Bill said. “Do you know them?” I asked Mike.",0
9180,"“No. I never saw them. They say they know me.” “I won’t stand it,” Bill said.",0
9181,"“Come on. Let’s go over to the Suizo,” I said. “They’re a bunch of Edna’s friends from Biarritz,” Bill said.",0
9182,"“They’re simply stupid,” Edna said. “One of them’s Charley Blackman, from Chicago,” Bill said. “I was never in Chicago,” Mike said.",0
9183,"Edna started to laugh and could not stop. “Take me away from here,” she said, “you bankrupts.”  “What kind of a row was it?” I asked Edna. We were walking across the square to the Suizo. Bill was gone.",0
9184,"“I don’t know what happened, but some one had the police called to keep Mike out of the back room. There were some people that had known Mike at Cannes. What’s the matter with Mike?”  “Probably he owes them money” I said.",0
9185,“That’s what people usually get bitter about.” In front of the ticket-booths out in the square there were two lines of people waiting. They were sitting on chairs or crouched on the ground with blankets and newspapers around them. They were waiting for the wickets to open in the morning to buy tickets for the bull-fight. The night was clearing and the moon was out. Some of the people in the line were sleeping.,0
9186,At the Café Suizo we had just sat down and ordered Fundador when Robert Cohn came up. “Where’s Brett?” he asked. “I don’t know.”,0
9187,“She was with you.” “She must have gone to bed.” “She’s not.”,0
9188,“I don’t know where she is.” His face was sallow under the light. He was standing up.,0
9189,"“Tell me where she is.”  “Sit down,” I said. “I don’t know where she is.” “The hell you don’t!”  “You can shut your face.”",0
9190,“Tell me where Brett is.”  “I’ll not tell you a damn thing.” “You know where she is.” “If I did I wouldn’t tell you.”,0
9191,"“Oh, go to hell, Cohn,” Mike called from the table. “Brett’s gone off with the bull-fighter chap. They’re on their honeymoon.”",0
9192,"“You shut up.” “Oh, go to hell!” Mike said languidly.",0
9193,“Is that where she is?” Cohn turned to me. “Go to hell!”,0
9194,“She was with you. Is that where she is?”  “Go to hell!” “I’ll make you tell me”—he stepped forward—“you damned pimp.”,0
9195,"I swung at him and he ducked. I saw his face duck sideways in the light. He hit me and I sat down on the pavement. As I started to get on my feet he hit me twice. I went down backward under a table. I tried to get up and felt I did not have any legs. I felt I must get on my feet and try and hit him. Mike helped me up. Some one poured a carafe of water on my head. Mike had an arm around me, and I found I was sitting on a chair. Mike was pulling at my ears.",0
9196,"“I say, you were cold,” Mike said. “Where the hell were you?” “Oh, I was around.”",0
9197,"“You didn’t want to mix in it?”  “He knocked Mike down, too,” Edna said. “He didn’t knock me out,” Mike said. “I just lay there.”",0
9198,"“Does this happen every night at your fiestas?” Edna asked. “Wasn’t that Mr. Cohn?”  “I’m all right,” I said.",0
9199,“My head’s a little wobbly.” There were several waiters and a crowd of people standing around. “Vaya!” said Mike. “Get away. Go on.”,0
9200,"The waiters moved the people away. “It was quite a thing to watch,” Edna said. “He must be a boxer.”",0
9201,"“He is.” “I wish Bill had been here,” Edna said. “I’d like to have seen Bill knocked down, too. I’ve always wanted to see Bill knocked down. He’s so big.”",0
9202,"“I was hoping he would knock down a waiter,” Mike said, “and get arrested. I’d like to see Mr. Robert Cohn in jail.” “No,” I said.",0
9203,"“Oh, no,” said Edna. “You don’t mean that.” “I do, though,” Mike said. “I’m not one of these chaps likes being knocked about. I never play games, even.”",0
9204,"Mike took a drink. “I never liked to hunt, you know. There was always the danger of having a horse fall on you. How do you feel, Jake?”  “All right.”",0
9205,"“You’re nice,” Edna said to Mike. “Are you really a bankrupt?”  “I’m a tremendous bankrupt,” Mike said. “I owe money to everybody. Don’t you owe any money?”  “Tons.”",0
9206,"“I owe everybody money,” Mike said. “I borrowed a hundred pesetas from Montoya to-night.” “The hell you did,” I said.",0
9207,"“I’ll pay it back,” Mike said. “I always pay everything back.” “That’s why you’re a bankrupt, isn’t it?” Edna said.",0
9208,I stood up. I had heard them talking from a long way away. It all seemed like some bad play.,0
9209,"“I’m going over to the hotel,” I said. Then I heard them talking about me. “Is he all right?” Edna asked.",0
9210,"“We’d better walk with him.” “I’m all right,” I said. “Don’t come. I’ll see you all later.”  I walked away from the café.",0
9211,They were sitting at the table. I looked back at them and at the empty tables. There was a waiter sitting at one of the tables with his head in his hands.,0
9212,"Walking across the square to the hotel everything looked new and changed. I had never seen the trees before. I had never seen the flagpoles before, nor the front of the theatre. It was all different. I felt as I felt once coming home from an out-of-town football game. I was carrying a suitcase with my football things in it, and I walked up the street from the station in the town I had lived in all my life and it was all new. They were raking the lawns and burning leaves in the road, and I stopped for a long time and watched. It was all strange. Then I went on, and my feet seemed to be a long way off, and everything seemed to come from a long way off, and I could hear my feet walking a great distance away. I had been kicked in the head early in the game. It was like that crossing the square. It was like that going up the stairs in the hotel. Going up the stairs took a long time, and I had the feeling that I was carrying my suitcase. There was a light in the room. Bill came out and met me in the hall.",0
9213,"“Say,” he said, “go up and see Cohn. He’s been in a jam, and he’s asking for you.” “The hell with him.”  “Go on.",0
9214,Go on up and see him.” I did not want to climb another flight of stairs. “What are you looking at me that way for?”  “I’m not looking at you.,0
9215,"Go on up and see Cohn. He’s in bad shape.” “You were drunk a little while ago,” I said.",0
9216,"“I’m drunk now,” Bill said. “But you go up and see Cohn. He wants to see you.”",0
9217,"“All right,” I said. It was just a matter of climbing more stairs. I went on up the stairs carrying my phantom suitcase. I walked down the hall to Cohn’s room. The door was shut and I knocked.",0
9218,"“Who is it?”  “Barnes.”  “Come in, Jake.” I opened the door and went in, and set down my suitcase. There was no light in the room. Cohn was lying, face down, on the bed in the dark.",0
9219,"“Hello, Jake.”  “Don’t call me Jake.” I stood by the door. It was just like this that I had come home. Now it was a hot bath that I needed. A deep, hot bath, to lie back in.",0
9220,"“Where’s the bathroom?” I asked. Cohn was crying. There he was, face down on the bed, crying. He had on a white polo shirt, the kind he’d worn at Princeton.",0
9221,"“I’m sorry, Jake. Please forgive me.”  “Forgive you, hell.” “Please forgive me, Jake.”",0
9222,I did not say anything. I stood there by the door. “I was crazy. You must see how it was.”,0
9223,"“Oh, that’s all right.” “I couldn’t stand it about Brett.” “You called me a pimp.”",0
9224,I did not care. I wanted a hot bath. I wanted a hot bath in deep water.,0
9225,“I know. Please don’t remember it. I was crazy.”,0
9226,“That’s all right.” He was crying. His voice was funny. He lay there in his white shirt on the bed in the dark. His polo shirt.,0
9227,"“I’m going away in the morning.” He was crying without making any noise. “I just couldn’t stand it about Brett. I’ve been through hell, Jake. It’s been simply hell. When I met her down here Brett treated me as though I were a perfect stranger. I just couldn’t stand it. We lived together at San Sebastian. I suppose you know it. I can’t stand it any more.”",0
9228,"He lay there on the bed. “Well,” I said, “I’m going to take a bath.” “You were the only friend I had, and I loved Brett so.”",0
9229,"“Well,” I said, “so long.”  “I guess it isn’t any use,” he said. “I guess it isn’t any damn use.”  “What?”  “Everything. Please say you forgive me, Jake.”  “Sure,” I said.",0
9230,"“It’s all right.” “I felt so terribly. I’ve been through such hell, Jake. Now everything’s gone. Everything.”  “Well,” I said, “so long.",0
9231,"I’ve got to go.” He rolled over, sat on the edge of the bed, and then stood up. “So long, Jake,” he said. “You’ll shake hands, won’t you?”  “Sure.",0
9232,"Why not?”  We shook hands. In the dark I could not see his face very well. “Well,” I said, “see you in the morning.”",0
9233,"“I’m going away in the morning.” “Oh, yes,” I said. I went out. Cohn was standing in the door of the room.",0
9234,"“Are you all right, Jake?” he asked. “Oh, yes,” I said. “I’m all right.”",0
9235,I could not find the bathroom. After a while I found it. There was a deep stone tub. I turned on the taps and the water would not run. I sat down on the edge of the bath-tub. When I got up to go I found I had taken off my shoes. I hunted for them and found them and carried them down-stairs. I found my room and went inside and undressed and got into bed.,0
9236,"I woke with a headache and the noise of the bands going by in the street. I remembered I had promised to take Bill’s friend Edna to see the bulls go through the street and into the ring. I dressed and went down-stairs and out into the cold early morning. People were crossing the square, hurrying toward the bull-ring. Across the square were the two lines of men in front of the ticket-booths. They were still waiting for the tickets to go on sale at seven o’clock. I hurried across the street to the café. The waiter told me that my friends had been there and gone.",0
9237,"“How many were they?”  “Two gentlemen and a lady.” That was all right. Bill and Mike were with Edna. She had been afraid last night they would pass out. That was why I was to be sure to take her. I drank the coffee and hurried with the other people toward the bull-ring. I was not groggy now. There was only a bad headache. Everything looked sharp and clear, and the town smelt of the early morning.",0
9238,"The stretch of ground from the edge of the town to the bull-ring was muddy. There was a crowd all along the fence that led to the ring, and the outside balconies and the top of the bull-ring were solid with people. I heard the rocket and I knew I could not get into the ring in time to see the bulls come in, so I shoved through the crowd to the fence. I was pushed close against the planks of the fence. Between the two fences of the runway the police were clearing the crowd along. They walked or trotted on into the bull-ring. Then people commenced to come running. A drunk slipped and fell. Two policemen grabbed him and rushed him over to the fence. The crowd were running fast now. There was a great shout from the crowd, and putting my head through between the boards I saw the bulls just coming out of the street into the long running pen. They were going fast and gaining on the crowd. Just then another drunk started out from the fence with a blouse in his hands. He wanted to do capework with the bulls. The two policemen tore out, collared him, one hit him with a club, and they dragged him against the fence and stood flattened out against the fence as the last of the crowd and the bulls went by. There were so many people running ahead of the bulls that the mass thickened and slowed up going through the gate into the ring, and as the bulls passed, galloping together, heavy, muddy-sided, horns swinging, one shot ahead, caught a man in the running crowd in the back and lifted him in the air. Both the man’s arms were by his sides, his head went back as the horn went in, and the bull lifted him and then dropped him. The bull picked another man running in front, but the man disappeared into the crowd, and the crowd was through the gate and into the ring with the bulls behind them. The red door of the ring went shut, the crowd on the outside balconies of the bull-ring were pressing through to the inside, there was a shout, then another shout.",0
9239,"The man who had been gored lay face down in the trampled mud. People climbed over the fence, and I could not see the man because the crowd was so thick around him. From inside the ring came the shouts. Each shout meant a charge by some bull into the crowd. You could tell by the degree of intensity in the shout how bad a thing it was that was happening. Then the rocket went up that meant the steers had gotten the bulls out of the ring and into the corrals. I left the fence and started back toward the town.",0
9240,Back in the town I went to the café to have a second coffee and some buttered toast. The waiters were sweeping out the café and mopping off the tables. One came over and took my order.,0
9241,“Anything happen at the encierro?”  “I didn’t see it all. One man was badly cogido.” “Where?”  “Here.”,0
9242,"I put one hand on the small of my back and the other on my chest, where it looked as though the horn must have come through. The waiter nodded his head and swept the crumbs from the table with his cloth. “Badly cogido,” he said. “All for sport. All for pleasure.”",0
9243,He went away and came back with the long-handled coffee and milk pots. He poured the milk and coffee. It came out of the long spouts in two streams into the big cup. The waiter nodded his head.,0
9244,"“Badly cogido through the back,” he said. He put the pots down on the table and sat down in the chair at the table. “A big horn wound. All for fun. Just for fun. What do you think of that?”  “I don’t know.”",0
9245,"“That’s it. All for fun. Fun, you understand.”",0
9246,“You’re not an aficionado?”  “Me? What are bulls? Animals. Brute animals.” He stood up and put his hand on the small of his back. “Right through the back. A cornada right through the back. For fun—you understand.”,0
9247,"He shook his head and walked away, carrying the coffee-pots. Two men were going by in the street. The waiter shouted to them. They were grave-looking. One shook his head. “Muerto!” he called.",0
9248,The waiter nodded his head. The two men went on. They were on some errand. The waiter came over to my table.,0
9249,“You hear? Muerto. Dead. He’s dead. With a horn through him. All for morning fun. Es muy flamenco.”,0
9250,"“It’s bad.”  “Not for me,” the waiter said. “No fun in that for me.” Later in the day we learned that the man who was killed was named Vicente Girones, and came from near Tafalla. The next day in the paper we read that he was twenty-eight years old, and had a farm, a wife, and two children. He had continued to come to the fiesta each year after he was married. The next day his wife came in from Tafalla to be with the body, and the day after there was a service in the chapel of San Fermin, and the coffin was carried to the railway-station by members of the dancing and drinking society of Tafalla. The drums marched ahead, and there was music on the fifes, and behind the men who carried the coffin walked the wife and two children. . . . Behind them marched all the members of the dancing and drinking societies of Pamplona, Estella, Tafalla, and Sanguesa who could stay over for the funeral. The coffin was loaded into the baggage-car of the train, and the widow and the two children rode, sitting, all three together, in an open third-class railway-carriage. The train started with a jerk, and then ran smoothly, going down grade around the edge of the plateau and out into the fields of grain that blew in the wind on the plain on the way to Tafalla.",0
9251,"The bull who killed Vicente Girones was named Bocanegra, was Number 118 of the bull-breeding establishment of Sanchez Tabemo, and was killed by Pedro Romero as the third bull of that same afternoon. His ear was cut by popular acclamation and given to Pedro Romero, who, in turn, gave it to Brett, who wrapped it in a handkerchief belonging to myself, and left both ear and handkerchief, along with a number of Muratti cigarette-stubs, shoved far back in the drawer of the bed-table that stood beside her bed in the Hotel Montoya, in Pamplona. Back in the hotel, the night watchman was sitting on a bench inside the door. He had been there all night and was very sleepy. He stood up as I came in. Three of the waitresses came in at the same time. They had been to the morning show at the bull-ring. They went up-stairs laughing. I followed them up-stairs and went into my room. I took off my shoes and lay down on the bed. The window was open onto the balcony and the sunlight was bright in the room. I did not feel sleepy. It must have been half past three o’clock when I had gone to bed and the bands had waked me at six. My jaw was sore on both sides. I felt it with my thumb and fingers. That damn Cohn. He should have hit somebody the first time he was insulted, and then gone away. He was so sure that Brett loved him. He was going to stay, and true love would conquer all. Some one knocked on the door.",0
9252,“Come in.” It was Bill and Mike. They sat down on the bed.,0
9253,"“Some encierro,” Bill said. “Some encierro.”  “I say, weren’t you there?” Mike asked. “Ring for some beer, Bill.”  “What a morning!”",0
9254,"Bill said. He mopped off his face. “My God! what a morning! And here’s old Jake. Old Jake, the human punching-bag.”",0
9255,"“What happened inside?”  “Good God!” Bill said, “what happened, Mike?”  “There were these bulls coming in,” Mike said. “Just ahead of them was the crowd, and some chap tripped and brought the whole lot of them down.”",0
9256,"“And the bulls all came in right over them,” Bill said. “I heard them yell.” “That was Edna,” Bill said.",0
9257,"“Chaps kept coming out and waving their shirts.” “One bull went along the barrera and hooked everybody over.” “They took about twenty chaps to the infirmary,” Mike said.",0
9258,“What a morning!” Bill said. “The damn police kept arresting chaps that wanted to go and commit suicide with the bulls.”,0
9259,"“The steers took them in, in the end,” Mike said. “It took about an hour.” “It was really about a quarter of an hour,” Mike objected.",0
9260,"“Oh, go to hell,” Bill said. “You’ve been in the war. It was two hours and a half for me.”",0
9261,“Where’s that beer?” Mike asked. “What did you do with the lovely Edna?”  “We took her home just now.,0
9262,She’s gone to bed.” “How did she like it?”  “Fine. We told her it was just like that every morning.”,0
9263,"“She was impressed,” Mike said. “She wanted us to go down in the ring, too,” Bill said. “She likes action.”",0
9264,"“I said it wouldn’t be fair to my creditors,” Mike said. “What a morning,” Bill said. “And what a night!”  “How’s your jaw, Jake?”",0
9265,"Mike asked. “Sore,” I said. Bill laughed.",0
9266,"“Why didn’t you hit him with a chair?”  “You can talk,” Mike said. “He’d have knocked you out, too. I never saw him hit me. I rather think I saw him just before, and then quite suddenly I was sitting down in the street, and Jake was lying under a table.”",0
9267,"“Where did he go afterward?” I asked. “Here she is,” Mike said. “Here’s the beautiful lady with the beer.”",0
9268,"The chambermaid put the tray with the beer-bottles and glasses down on the table. “Now bring up three more bottles,” Mike said. “Where did Cohn go after he hit me?” I asked Bill.",0
9269,"“Don’t you know about that?” Mike was opening a beer-bottle. He poured the beer into one of the glasses, holding the glass close to the bottle.",0
9270,"“Really?” Bill asked. “Why he went in and found Brett and the bull-fighter chap in the bull-fighter’s room, and then he massacred the poor, bloody bull-fighter.”  “No.”  “Yes.”  “What a night!” Bill said.",0
9271,"“He nearly killed the poor, bloody bull-fighter. Then Cohn wanted to take Brett away. Wanted to make an honest woman of her, I imagine. Damned touching scene.”",0
9272,He took a long drink of the beer. “He is an ass.”  “What happened?”  “Brett gave him what for. She told him off. I think she was rather good.”,0
9273,"“I’ll bet she was,” Bill said. “Then Cohn broke down and cried, and wanted to shake hands with the bull-fighter fellow. He wanted to shake hands with Brett, too.”",0
9274,"“I know. He shook hands with me.” “Did he? Well, they weren’t having any of it. The bull-fighter fellow was rather good. He didn’t say much, but he kept getting up and getting knocked down again. Cohn couldn’t knock him out. It must have been damned funny.”",0
9275,“Where did you hear all this?”  “Brett. I saw her this morning.” “What happened finally?”  “It seems the bull-fighter fellow was sitting on the bed.,0
9276,"He’d been knocked down about fifteen times, and he wanted to fight some more. Brett held him and wouldn’t let him get up. He was weak, but Brett couldn’t hold him, and he got up. Then Cohn said he wouldn’t hit him again. Said he couldn’t do it. Said it would be wicked. So the bull-fighter chap sort of rather staggered over to him. Cohn went back against the wall.",0
9277,"“ ‘So you won’t hit me?’  “ ‘No,’ said Cohn. ‘I’d be ashamed to.’ “So the bull-fighter fellow hit him just as hard as he could in the face, and then sat down on the floor. He couldn’t get up, Brett said. Cohn wanted to pick him up and carry him to the bed. He said if Cohn helped him he’d kill him, and he’d kill him anyway this morning if Cohn wasn’t out of town. Cohn was crying, and Brett had told him off, and he wanted to shake hands. I’ve told you that before.”",0
9278,"“Tell the rest,” Bill said. “It seems the bull-fighter chap was sitting on the floor. He was waiting to get strength enough to get up and hit Cohn again. Brett wasn’t having any shaking hands, and Cohn was crying and telling her how much he loved her, and she was telling him not to be a ruddy ass. Then Cohn leaned down to shake hands with the bull-fighter fellow. No hard feelings, you know. All for forgiveness. And the bull-fighter chap hit him in the face again.”",0
9279,"“That’s quite a kid,” Bill said. “He ruined Cohn,” Mike said. “You know I don’t think Cohn will ever want to knock people about again.”",0
9280,“When did you see Brett?”  “This morning. She came in to get some things. She’s looking after this Romero lad.”,0
9281,He poured out another bottle of beer. “Brett’s rather cut up. But she loves looking after people. That’s how we came to go off together. She was looking after me.”,0
9282,"“I know,” I said. “I’m rather drunk,” Mike said. “I think I’ll stay rather drunk. This is all awfully amusing, but it’s not too pleasant. It’s not too pleasant for me.”",0
9283,"He drank off the beer. “I gave Brett what for, you know. I said if she would go about with Jews and bull-fighters and such people, she must expect trouble.” He leaned forward. “I say, Jake, do you mind if I drink that bottle of yours? She’ll bring you another one.”",0
9284,"“Please,” I said. “I wasn’t drinking it, anyway.” Mike started to open the bottle. “Would you mind opening it?” I pressed up the wire fastener and poured it for him.",0
9285,"“You know,” Mike went on, “Brett was rather good. She’s always rather good. I gave her a fearful hiding about Jews and bull-fighters, and all those sort of people, and do you know what she said: ‘Yes. I’ve had such a hell of a happy life with the British aristocracy!’ ”  He took a drink.",0
9286,"“That was rather good. Ashley, chap she got the title from, was a sailor, you know. Ninth baronet. When he came home he wouldn’t sleep in a bed. Always made Brett sleep on the floor. Finally, when he got really bad, he used to tell her he’d kill her. Always slept with a loaded service revolver. Brett used to take the shells out when he’d gone to sleep. She hasn’t had an absolutely happy life. Brett. Damned shame, too. She enjoys things so.”",0
9287,He stood up. His hand was shaky. “I’m going in the room. Try and get a little sleep.”,0
9288,He smiled. “We go too long without sleep in these fiestas. I’m going to start now and get plenty of sleep. Damn bad thing not to get sleep. Makes you frightfully nervy.”,0
9289,"“We’ll see you at noon at the Iruña,” Bill said. Mike went out the door. We heard him in the next room.",0
9290,"He rang the bell and the chambermaid came and knocked at the door. “Bring up half a dozen bottles of beer and a bottle of Fundador,” Mike told her. “Si, Señorito.”  “I’m going to bed,” Bill said.",0
9291,“Poor old Mike. I had a hell of a row about him last night.” “Where? At that Milano place?”  “Yes.,0
9292,"There was a fellow there that had helped pay Brett and Mike out of Cannes, once. He was damned nasty.” “I know the story.”",0
9293,“I didn’t. Nobody ought to have a right to say things about Mike.”  “That’s what makes it bad.” “They oughtn’t to have any right. I wish to hell they didn’t have any right. I’m going to bed.”  “Was anybody killed in the ring?”  “I don’t think so.,0
9294,"Just badly hurt.” “A man was killed outside in the runway.”  “Was there?” said Bill. CHAPTER 18 At noon we were all at the café. It was crowded. We were eating shrimps and drinking beer. The town was crowded. Every street was full. Big motor-cars from Biarritz and San Sebastian kept driving up and parking around the square. They brought people for the bull-fight. Sight-seeing cars came up, too. There was one with twenty-five Englishwomen in it. They sat in the big, white car and looked through their glasses at the fiesta. The dancers were all quite drunk. It was the last day of the fiesta.",0
9295,"The fiesta was solid and unbroken, but the motor-cars and tourist-cars made little islands of onlookers. When the cars emptied, the onlookers were absorbed into the crowd. You did not see them again except as sport clothes, odd-looking at a table among the closely packed peasants in black smocks. The fiesta absorbed even the Biarritz English so that you did not see them unless you passed close to a table. All the time there was music in the street. The drums kept on pounding and the pipes were going. Inside the cafés men with their hands gripping the table, or on each other’s shoulders, were singing the hard-voiced singing.",0
9296,"“Here comes Brett,” Bill said. I looked and saw her coming through the crowd in the square, walking, her head up, as though the fiesta were being staged in her honor, and she found it pleasant and amusing. “Hello, you chaps!” she said. “I say, I have a thirst.”  “Get another big beer,” Bill said to the waiter.",0
9297,"“Shrimps?”  “Is Cohn gone?” Brett asked. “Yes,” Bill said. “He hired a car.”",0
9298,"The beer came. Brett started to lift the glass mug and her hand shook. She saw it and smiled, and leaned forward and took a long sip.",0
9299,"“Good beer.”  “Very good,” I said. I was nervous about Mike. I did not think he had slept. He must have been drinking all the time, but he seemed to be under control.",0
9300,"“I heard Cohn had hurt you, Jake,” Brett said. “No. Knocked me out. That was all.”",0
9301,"“I say, he did hurt Pedro Romero,” Brett said. “He hurt him most badly.” “How is he?”  “He’ll be all right.",0
9302,He won’t go out of the room.” “Does he look badly?”  “Very. He was really hurt. I told him I wanted to pop out and see you chaps for a minute.”,0
9303,"“Is he going to fight?”  “Rather. I’m going with you, if you don’t mind.” “How’s your boy friend?” Mike asked. He had not listened to anything that Brett had said.",0
9304,"“Brett’s got a bull-fighter,” he said. “She had a Jew named Cohn, but he turned out badly.” Brett stood up.",0
9305,"“I am not going to listen to that sort of rot from you, Michael.” “How’s your boy friend?”  “Damned well,” Brett said. “Watch him this afternoon.”",0
9306,"“Brett’s got a bull-fighter,” Mike said. “A beautiful, bloody bull-fighter.”  “Would you mind walking over with me? I want to talk to you, Jake.”  “Tell him all about your bull-fighter,” Mike said.",0
9307,"“Oh, to hell with your bull-fighter!” He tipped the table so that all the beers and the dish of shrimps went over in a crash. “Come on,” Brett said. “Let’s get out of this.”",0
9308,"In the crowd crossing the square I said: “How is it?”  “I’m not going to see him after lunch until the fight. His people come in and dress him. They’re very angry about me, he says.”",0
9309,Brett was radiant. She was happy. The sun was out and the day was bright.,0
9310,"“I feel altogether changed,” Brett said. “You’ve no idea, Jake.”  “Anything you want me to do?”  “No, just go to the fight with me.” “We’ll see you at lunch?”  “No.",0
9311,I’m eating with him.” We were standing under the arcade at the door of the hotel. They were carrying tables out and setting them up under the arcade.,0
9312,“Want to take a turn out to the park?” Brett asked. “I don’t want to go up yet. I fancy he’s sleeping.”,0
9313,"We walked along past the theatre and out of the square and along through the barracks of the fair, moving with the crowd between the lines of booths. We came out on a cross-street that led to the Paseo de Sarasate. We could see the crowd walking there, all the fashionably dressed people. They were making the turn at the upper end of the park.",0
9314,"“Don’t let’s go there,” Brett said. “I don’t want staring at just now.” We stood in the sunlight. It was hot and good after the rain and the clouds from the sea.",0
9315,"“I hope the wind goes down,” Brett said. “It’s very bad for him.” “So do I.”  “He says the bulls are all right.”  “They’re good.”  “Is that San Fermin’s?”  Brett looked at the yellow wall of the chapel.",0
9316,“Yes. Where the show started on Sunday.”  “Let’s go in. Do you mind? I’d rather like to pray a little for him or something.”,0
9317,"We went in through the heavy leather door that moved very lightly. It was dark inside. Many people were praying. You saw them as your eyes adjusted themselves to the half-light. We knelt at one of the long wooden benches. After a little I felt Brett stiffen beside me, and saw she was looking straight ahead.",0
9318,"“Come on,” she whispered throatily. “Let’s get out of here. Makes me damned nervous.”",0
9319,"Outside in the hot brightness of the street Brett looked up at the tree-tops in the wind. The praying had not been much of a success. “Don’t know why I get so nervy in church,” Brett said. “Never does me any good.”",0
9320,"We walked along. “I’m damned bad for a religious atmosphere,” Brett said. “I’ve the wrong type of face.",0
9321,"“You know,” Brett said, “I’m not worried about him at all. I just feel happy about him.”  “Good.” “I wish the wind would drop, though.”",0
9322,"“It’s liable to go down by five o’clock.”  “Let’s hope.” “You might pray,” I laughed. “Never does me any good. I’ve never gotten anything I prayed for. Have you?”  “Oh, yes.”",0
9323,"“Oh, rot,” said Brett. “Maybe it works for some people, though. You don’t look very religious, Jake.”",0
9324,"“I’m pretty religious.” “Oh, rot,” said Brett. “Don’t start proselyting to-day. To-day’s going to be bad enough as it is.”",0
9325,"It was the first time I had seen her in the old happy, careless way since before she went off with Cohn. We were back again in front of the hotel. All the tables were set now, and already several were filled with people eating.",0
9326,"“Do look after Mike,” Brett said. “Don’t let him get too bad.” “Your frients haff gone up-stairs,” the German maître d’hôtel said in English. He was a continual eavesdropper. Brett turned to him:  “Thank you, so much.",0
9327,"Have you anything else to say?”  “No, ma’am.”  “Good,” said Brett. “Save us a table for three,” I said to the German. He smiled his dirty little pink-and-white smile.",0
9328,"“Iss madam eating here?”  “No,” Brett said. “Den I think a tabul for two will be enuff.”  “Don’t talk to him,” Brett said. “Mike must have been in bad shape,” she said on the stairs. We passed Montoya on the stairs. He bowed and did not smile.",0
9329,"“I’ll see you at the café,” Brett said. “Thank you, so much, Jake.” We had stopped at the floor our rooms were on. She went straight down the hall and into Romero’s room. She did not knock. She simply opened the door, went in, and closed it behind her.",0
9330,I stood in front of the door of Mike’s room and knocked. There was no answer. I tried the knob and it opened. Inside the room was in great disorder. All the bags were opened and clothing was strewn around. There were empty bottles beside the bed. Mike lay on the bed looking like a death mask of himself. He opened his eyes and looked at me.,0
9331,"“Hello, Jake,” he said very slowly. “I’m getting a lit tle sleep. I’ve want ed a lit tle sleep for a long time.”  “Let me cover you over.”",0
9332,“No. I’m quite warm.”  “Don’t go. I have n’t got ten to sleep yet.”,0
9333,"“You’ll sleep, Mike. Don’t worry, boy.” “Brett’s got a bull-fighter,” Mike said. “But her Jew has gone away.”",0
9334,"He turned his head and looked at me. “Damned good thing, what?”  “Yes. Now go to sleep, Mike. You ought to get some sleep.”  “I’m just start ing.",0
9335,I’m go ing to get a lit tle sleep.” He shut his eyes. I went out of the room and turned the door to quietly. Bill was in my room reading the paper.,0
9336,“See Mike?”  “Yes.”  “Let’s go and eat.” “I won’t eat down-stairs with that German head waiter. He was damned snotty when I was getting Mike up-stairs.”,0
9337,"“He was snotty to us, too.”  “Let’s go out and eat in the town.” We went down the stairs. On the stairs we passed a girl coming up with a covered tray.",0
9338,"“There goes Brett’s lunch,” Bill said. “And the kid’s,” I said. Outside on the terrace under the arcade the German head waiter came up. His red cheeks were shiny. He was being polite.",0
9339,"“I haff a tabul for two for you gentlemen,” he said. “Go sit at it,” Bill said. We went on out across the street.",0
9340,We ate at a restaurant in a side street off the square. They were all men eating in the restaurant. It was full of smoke and drinking and singing. The food was good and so was the wine. We did not talk much. Afterward we went to the café and watched the fiesta come to the boiling-point. Brett came over soon after lunch. She said she had looked in the room and that Mike was asleep.,0
9341,"When the fiesta boiled over and toward the bull-ring we went with the crowd. Brett sat at the ringside between Bill and me. Directly below us was the callejon, the passageway between the stands and the red fence of the barrera. Behind us the concrete stands filled solidly. Out in front, beyond the red fence, the sand of the ring was smooth-rolled and yellow. It looked a little heavy from the rain, but it was dry in the sun and firm and smooth. The sword-handlers and bull-ring servants came down the callejon carrying on their shoulders the wicker baskets of fighting capes and muletas. They were bloodstained and compactly folded and packed in the baskets. The sword-handlers opened the heavy leather sword-cases so the red wrapped hilts of the sheaf of swords showed as the leather case leaned against the fence. They unfolded the dark-stained red flannel of the muletas and fixed batons in them to spread the stuff and give the matador something to hold. Brett watched it all. She was absorbed in the professional details.",0
9342,"“He’s his name stencilled on all the capes and muletas,” she said. “Why do they call them muletas?”  “I don’t know.” “I wonder if they ever launder them.”",0
9343,"“I don’t think so. It might spoil the color.” “The blood must stiffen them,” Bill said.",0
9344,"“Funny,” Brett said. “How one doesn’t mind the blood.” Below in the narrow passage of the callejon the sword-handlers arranged everything. All the seats were full. Above, all the boxes were full. There was not an empty seat except in the President’s box. When he came in the fight would start. Across the smooth sand, in the high doorway that led into the corrals, the bull-fighters were standing, their arms furled in their capes, talking, waiting for the signal to march in across the arena. Brett was watching them with the glasses.",0
9345,"“Here, would you like to look?”  I looked through the glasses and saw the three matadors. Romero was in the centre, Belmonte on his left, Marcial on his right. Back of them were their people, and behind the banderilleros, back in the passageway and in the open space of the corral, I saw the picadors. Romero was wearing a black suit. His tricornered hat was low down over his eyes. I could not see his face clearly under the hat, but it looked badly marked. He was looking straight ahead. Marcial was smoking a cigarette guardedly, holding it in his hand. Belmonte looked ahead, his face wan and yellow, his long wolf jaw out. He was looking at nothing. Neither he nor Romero seemed to have anything in common with the others. They were all alone. The President came in; there was handclapping above us in the grand stand, and I handed the glasses to Brett. There was applause. The music started. Brett looked through the glasses.",0
9346,"“Here, take them,” she said. Through the glasses I saw Belmonte speak to Romero. Marcial straightened up and dropped his cigarette, and, looking straight ahead, their heads back, their free arms swinging, the three matadors walked out. Behind them came all the procession, opening out, all striding in step, all the capes furled, everybody with free arms swinging, and behind rode the picadors, their pics rising like lances. Behind all came the two trains of mules and the bull-ring servants. The matadors bowed, holding their hats on, before the President’s box, and then came over to the barrera below us. Pedro Romero took off his heavy gold-brocaded cape and handed it over the fence to his sword-handler. He said something to the sword-handler. Close below us we saw Romero’s lips were puffed, both eyes were discolored. His face was discolored and swollen. The sword-handler took the cape, looked up at Brett, and came over to us and handed up the cape.",0
9347,"“Spread it out in front of you,” I said. Brett leaned forward. The cape was heavy and smoothly stiff with gold. The sword-handler looked back, shook his head, and said something. A man beside me leaned over toward Brett.",0
9348,"“He doesn’t want you to spread it,” he said. “You should fold it and keep it in your lap.” Brett folded the heavy cape.",0
9349,"Romero did not look up at us. He was speaking to Belmonte. Belmonte had sent his formal cape over to some friends. He looked across at them and smiled, his wolf smile that was only with the mouth. Romero leaned over the barrera and asked for the water-jug. The sword-handler brought it and Romero poured water over the percale of his fighting-cape, and then scuffed the lower folds in the sand with his slippered foot.",0
9350,“What’s that for?” Brett asked. “To give it weight in the wind.”,0
9351,"“His face looks bad,” Bill said. “He feels very badly,” Brett said. “He should be in bed.”",0
9352,"The first bull was Belmonte’s. Belmonte was very good. But because he got thirty thousand pesetas and people had stayed in line all night to buy tickets to see him, the crowd demanded that he should be more than very good. Belmonte’s great attraction is working close to the bull. In bull-fighting they speak of the terrain of the bull and the terrain of the bull-fighter. As long as a bull-fighter stays in his own terrain he is comparatively safe. Each time he enters into the terrain of the bull he is in great danger. Belmonte, in his best days, worked always in the terrain of the bull. This way he gave the sensation of coming tragedy. People went to the corrida to see Belmonte, to be given tragic sensations, and perhaps to see the death of Belmonte. Fifteen years ago they said if you wanted to see Belmonte you should go quickly, while he was still alive. Since then he has killed more than a thousand bulls. When he retired the legend grew up about how his bull-fighting had been, and when he came out of retirement the public were disappointed because no real man could work as close to the bulls as Belmonte was supposed to have done, not, of course, even Belmonte.",0
9353,"Also Belmonte imposed conditions and insisted that his bulls should not be too large, nor too dangerously armed with horns, and so the element that was necessary to give the sensation of tragedy was not there, and the public, who wanted three times as much from Belmonte, who was sick with a fistula, as Belmonte had ever been able to give, felt defrauded and cheated, and Belmonte’s jaw came further out in contempt, and his face turned yellower, and he moved with greater difficulty as his pain increased, and finally the crowd were actively against him, and he was utterly contemptuous and indifferent. He had meant to have a great afternoon, and instead it was an afternoon of sneers, shouted insults, and finally a volley of cushions and pieces of bread and vegetables, thrown down at him in the plaza where he had had his greatest triumphs. His jaw only went further out. Sometimes he turned to smile that toothed, long-jawed, lipless smile when he was called something particularly insulting, and always the pain that any movement produced grew stronger and stronger, until finally his yellow face was parchment color, and after his second bull was dead and the throwing of bread and cushions was over, after he had saluted the President with the same wolf-jawed smile and contemptuous eyes, and handed his sword over the barrera to be wiped, and put back in its case, he passed through into the callejon and leaned on the barrera below us, his head on his arms, not seeing, not hearing anything, only going through his pain. When he looked up, finally, he asked for a drink of water. He swallowed a little, rinsed his mouth, spat the water, took his cape, and went back into the ring.",0
9354,"Because they were against Belmonte the public were for Romero. From the moment he left the barrera and went toward the bull they applauded him. Belmonte watched Romero, too, watched him always without seeming to. He paid no attention to Marcial. Marcial was the sort of thing he knew all about. He had come out of retirement to compete with Marcial, knowing it was a competition gained in advance. He had expected to compete with Marcial and the other stars of the decadence of bull-fighting, and he knew that the sincerity of his own bull-fighting would be so set off by the false æsthetics of the bull-fighters of the decadent period that he would only have to be in the ring. His return from retirement had been spoiled by Romero. Romero did always, smoothly, calmly, and beautifully, what he, Belmonte, could only bring himself to do now sometimes. The crowd felt it, even the people from Biarritz, even the American ambassador saw it, finally. It was a competition that Belmonte would not enter because it would lead only to a bad horn wound or death. Belmonte was no longer well enough. He no longer had his greatest moments in the bull-ring. He was not sure that there were any great moments. Things were not the same and now life only came in flashes. He had flashes of the old greatness with his bulls, but they were not of value because he had discounted them in advance when he had picked the bulls out for their safety, getting out of a motor and leaning on a fence, looking over at the herd on the ranch of his friend the bull-breeder. So he had two small, manageable bulls without much horns, and when he felt the greatness again coming, just a little of it through the pain that was always with him, it had been discounted and sold in advance, and it did not give him a good feeling. It was the greatness, but it did not make bull-fighting wonderful to him any more.",0
9355,"Pedro Romero had the greatness. He loved bull-fighting, and I think he loved the bulls, and I think he loved Brett. Everything of which he could control the locality he did in front of her all that afternoon. Never once did he look up. He made it stronger that way, and did it for himself, too, as well as for her. Because he did not look up to ask if it pleased he did it all for himself inside, and it strengthened him, and yet he did it for her, too. But he did not do it for her at any loss to himself. He gained by it all through the afternoon.",0
9356,"His first “quite” was directly below us. The three matadors take the bull in turn after each charge he makes at a picador. Belmonte was the first. Marcial was the second. Then came Romero. The three of them were standing at the left of the horse. The picador, his hat down over his eyes, the shaft of his pic angling sharply toward the bull, kicked in the spurs and held them and with the reins in his left hand walked the horse forward toward the bull. The bull was watching. Seemingly he watched the white horse, but really he watched the triangular steel point of the pic. Romero, watching, saw the bull start to turn his head. He did not want to charge. Romero flicked his cape so the color caught the bull’s eye. The bull charged with the reflex, charged, and found not the flash of color but a white horse, and a man leaned far over the horse, shot the steel point of the long hickory shaft into the hump of muscle on the bull’s shoulder, and pulled his horse sideways as he pivoted on the pic, making a wound, enforcing the iron into the bull’s shoulder, making him bleed for Belmonte.",0
9357,"The bull did not insist under the iron. He did not really want to get at the horse. He turned and the group broke apart and Romero was taking him out with his cape. He took him out softly and smoothly, and then stopped and, standing squarely in front of the bull, offered him the cape. The bull’s tail went up and he charged, and Romero moved his arms ahead of the bull, wheeling, his feet firmed. The dampened, mud-weighted cape swung open and full as a sail fills, and Romero pivoted with it just ahead of the bull. At the end of the pass they were facing each other again. Romero smiled. The bull wanted it again, and Romero’s cape filled again, this time on the other side. Each time he let the bull pass so close that the man and the bull and the cape that filled and pivoted ahead of the bull were all one sharply etched mass. It was all so slow and so controlled. It was as though he were rocking the bull to sleep. He made four veronicas like that, and finished with a half-veronica that turned his back on the bull and came away toward the applause, his hand on his hip, his cape on his arm, and the bull watching his back going away.",0
9358,"In his own bulls he was perfect. His first bull did not see well. After the first two passes with the cape Romero knew exactly how bad the vision was impaired. He worked accordingly. It was not brilliant bull-fighting. It was only perfect bull-fighting. The crowd wanted the bull changed. They made a great row. Nothing very fine could happen with a bull that could not see the lures, but the President would not order him replaced.",0
9359,“Why don’t they change him?” Brett asked. “They’ve paid for him. They don’t want to lose their money.”,0
9360,"“It’s hardly fair to Romero.”  “Watch how he handles a bull that can’t see the color.” “It’s the sort of thing I don’t like to see.” It was not nice to watch if you cared anything about the person who was doing it. With the bull who could not see the colors of the capes, or the scarlet flannel of the muleta, Romero had to make the bull consent with his body. He had to get so close that the bull saw his body, and would start for it, and then shift the bull’s charge to the flannel and finish out the pass in the classic manner. The Biarritz crowd did not like it They thought Romero was afraid, and that was why he gave that little sidestep each time as he transferred the bull’s charge from his own body to the flannel. They preferred Belmonte’s imitation of himself or Marcial’s imitation of Belmonte. There were three of them in the row behind us.",0
9361,“What’s he afraid of the bull for? The bull’s so dumb he only goes after the cloth.”  “He’s just a young bull-fighter. He hasn’t learned it yet.”,0
9362,"“But I thought he was fine with the cape before.” “Probably he’s nervous now.” Out in the centre of the ring, all alone, Romero was going on with the same thing, getting so close that the bull could see him plainly, offering the body, offering it again a little closer, the bull watching dully, then so close that the bull thought he had him, offering again and finally drawing the charge and then, just before the horns came, giving the bull the red cloth to follow with at little, almost imperceptible, jerk that so offended the critical judgment of the Biarritz bull-fight experts.",0
9363,"“He’s going to kill now,” I said to Brett. “The bull’s still strong. He wouldn’t wear himself out.”",0
9364,"Out in the centre of the ring Romero profiled in front of the bull, drew the sword out from the folds of the muleta, rose on his toes, and sighted along the blade. The bull charged as Romero charged. Romero’s left hand dropped the muleta over the bull’s muzzle to blind him, his left shoulder went forward between the horns as the sword went in, and for just an instant he and the bull were one, Romero way out over the bull, the right arm extended high up to where the hilt of the sword had gone in between the bull’s shoulders. Then the figure was broken. There was a little jolt as Romero came clear, and then he was standing, one hand up, facing the bull, his shirt ripped out from under his sleeve, the white blowing in the wind, and the bull, the red sword hilt tight between his shoulders, his head going down and his legs settling.",0
9365,"“There he goes,” Bill said. Romero was close enough so the bull could see him. His hand still up, he spoke to the bull. The bull gathered himself, then his head went forward and he went over slowly, then all over, suddenly, four feet in the air.",0
9366,"They handed the sword to Romero, and carrying it blade down, the muleta in his other hand, he walked over to in front of the President’s box, bowed, straightened, and came over to the barrera and handed over the sword and muleta. “Bad one,” said the sword-handler. “He made me sweat,” said Romero. He wiped off his face. The sword-handler handed him the water-jug. Romero wiped his lips. It hurt him to drink out of the jug. He did not look up at us.",0
9367,Marcial had a big day. They were still applauding him when Romero’s last bull came in. It was the bull that had sprinted out and killed the man in the morning running.,0
9368,"During Romero’s first bull his hurt face had been very noticeable. Everything he did showed it. All the concentration of the awkwardly delicate working with the bull that could not see well brought it out. The fight with Cohn had not touched his spirit but his face had been smashed and his body hurt. He was wiping all that out now. Each thing that he did with this bull wiped that out a little cleaner. It was a good bull, a big bull, and with horns, and it turned and recharged easily and surely. He was what Romero wanted in bulls.",0
9369,"When he had finished his work with the muleta and was ready to kill, the crowd made him go on. They did not want the bull killed yet, they did not want it to be over. Romero went on. It was like a course in bull-fighting. All the passes he linked up, all completed, all slow, templed and smooth. There were no tricks and no mystifications. There was no brusqueness. And each pass as it reached the summit gave you a sudden ache inside. The crowd did not want it ever to be finished.",0
9370,"The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed, and Romero killed directly below us. He killed not as he had been forced to by the last bull, but as he wanted to. He profiled directly in front of the bull, drew the sword out of the folds of the muleta and sighted along the blade. The bull watched him. Romero spoke to the bull and tapped one of his feet. The bull charged and Romero waited for the charge, the muleta held low, sighting along the blade, his feet firm. Then without taking a step forward, he became one with the bull, the sword was in high between the shoulders, the bull had followed the low-swung flannel, that disappeared as Romero lurched clear to the left, and it was over. The bull tried to go forward, his legs commenced to settle, he swung from side to side, hesitated, then went down on his knees, and Romero’s older brother leaned forward behind him and drove a short knife into the bull’s neck at the base of the horns. The first time he missed. He drove the knife in again, and the bull went over, twitching and rigid. Romero’s brother, holding the bull’s horn in one hand, the knife in the other, looked up at the President’s box. Handkerchiefs were waving all over the bull-ring. The President looked down from the box and waved his handkerchief. The brother cut the notched black ear from the dead bull and trotted over with it to Romero. The bull lay heavy and black on the sand, his tongue out. Boys were running toward him from all parts of the arena, making a little circle around him. They were starting to dance around the bull.",0
9371,"Romero took the ear from his brother and held it up toward the President. The President bowed and Romero, running to get ahead of the crowd, came toward us. He leaned up against the barrera and gave the ear to Brett. He nodded his head and smiled. The crowd were all about him. Brett held down the cape.",0
9372,“You liked it?” Romero called. Brett did not say anything. They looked at each other and smiled. Brett had the ear in her hand.,0
9373,"“Don’t get bloody,” Romero said, and grinned. The crowd wanted him. Several boys shouted at Brett. The crowd was the boys, the dancers, and the drunks. Romero turned and tried to get through the crowd. They were all around him trying to lift him and put him on their shoulders. He fought and twisted away, and started running, in the midst of them, toward the exit. He did not want to be carried on people’s shoulders. But they held him and lifted him. It was uncomfortable and his legs were spraddled and his body was very sore. They were lifting him and all running toward the gate. He had his hand on somebody’s shoulder. He looked around at us apologetically. The crowd, running, went out the gate with him.",0
9374,"We all three went back to the hotel. Brett went up-stairs. Bill and I sat in the down-stairs dining-room and ate some hard-boiled eggs and drank several bottles of beer. Belmonte came down in his street clothes with his manager and two other men. They sat at the next table and ate. Belmonte ate very little. They were leaving on the seven o’clock train for Barcelona. Belmonte wore a blue-striped shirt and a dark suit, and ate soft-boiled eggs. The others ate a big meal. Belmonte did not talk. He only answered questions.",0
9375,Bill was tired after the bull-fight. So was I. We both took a bull-fight very hard. We sat and ate the eggs and I watched Belmonte and the people at his table. The men with him were tough-looking and businesslike.,0
9376,"“Come on over to the café,” Bill said. “I want an absinthe.” It was the last day of the fiesta. Outside it was beginning to be cloudy again. The square was full of people and the fireworks experts were making up their set pieces for the night and covering them over with beech branches. Boys were watching. We passed stands of rockets with long bamboo stems. Outside the café there was a great crowd. The music and the dancing were going on. The giants and the dwarfs were passing.",0
9377,“Where’s Edna?” I asked Bill. “I don’t know.”,0
9378,"We watched the beginning of the evening of the last night of the fiesta. The absinthe made everything seem better. I drank it without sugar in the dripping glass, and it was pleasantly bitter.",0
9379,"“I feel sorry about Cohn,” Bill said. “He had an awful time.” “Oh, to hell with Cohn,” I said.",0
9380,"“Where do you suppose he went?”  “Up to Paris.” “What do you suppose he’ll do?”  “Oh, to hell with him.” “What do you suppose he’ll do?”  “Pick up with his old girl, probably.”  “Who was his old girl?”  “Somebody named Frances.”",0
9381,We had another absinthe. “When do you go back?” I asked.,0
9382,"“To-morrow.” After a little while Bill said: “Well, it was a swell fiesta.” “Yes,” I said; “something doing all the time.”",0
9383,"“You wouldn’t believe it. It’s like a wonderful nightmare.” “Sure,” I said. “I’d believe anything. Including nightmares.”  “What’s the matter?",0
9384,"Feel low?”  “Low as hell.” “Have another absinthe. Here, waiter! Another absinthe for this señor.”  “I feel like hell,” I said.",0
9385,"“Drink that,” said Bill. “Drink it slow.” It was beginning to get dark. The fiesta was going on. I began to feel drunk but I did not feel any better.",0
9386,"“How do you feel?”  “I feel like hell.” “Have another?”  “It won’t do any good.”  “Try it. You can’t tell; maybe this is the one that gets it. Hey, waiter! Another absinthe for this señor!”",0
9387,"I poured the water directly into it and stirred it instead of letting it drip. Bill put in a lump of ice. I stirred the ice around with a spoon in the brownish, cloudy mixture.",0
9388,“How is it?”  “Fine.”  “Don’t drink it fast that way. It will make you sick.” I set down the glass. I had not meant to drink it fast.,0
9389,"“I feel tight.” “You ought to.”  “That’s what you wanted, wasn’t it?”  “Sure. Get tight. Get over your damn depression.”",0
9390,"“Well, I’m tight. Is that what you want?”  “Sit down.” “I won’t sit down,” I said. “I’m going over to the hotel.”",0
9391,I was very drunk. I was drunker than I ever remembered having been. At the hotel I went up-stairs. Brett’s door was open. I put my head in the room. Mike was sitting on the bed. He waved a bottle.,0
9392,"“Jake,” he said. “Come in, Jake.” I went in and sat down. The room was unstable unless I looked at some fixed point.",0
9393,"“Brett, you know. She’s gone off with the bull-fighter chap.” “No.”  “Yes.",0
9394,"She looked for you to say good-bye. They went on the seven o’clock train.” “Did they?”  “Bad thing to do,” Mike said.",0
9395,“She shouldn’t have done it.” “No.”  “Have a drink? Wait while I ring for some beer.”,0
9396,"“I’m drunk,” I said. “I’m going in and lie down.” “Are you blind? I was blind myself.”",0
9397,"“Yes,” I said, “I’m blind.” “Well, bung-o,” Mike said. “Get some sleep, old Jake.”",0
9398,I went out the door and into my own room and lay on the bed. The bed went sailing off and I sat up in bed and looked at the wall to make it stop. Outside in the square the fiesta was going on. It did not mean anything. Later Bill and Mike came in to get me to go down and eat with them. I pretended to be asleep.,0
9399,"“He’s asleep. Better let him alone.” “He’s blind as a tick,” Mike said. They went out.",0
9400,"I got up and went to the balcony and looked out at the dancing in the square. The world was not wheeling any more. It was just very clear and bright, and inclined to blur at the edges. I washed, brushed my hair. I looked strange to myself in the glass, and went down-stairs to the dining-room.",0
9401,“Here he is!” said Bill. “Good old Jake! I knew you wouldn’t pass out.”,0
9402,"“Hello, you old drunk,” Mike said. “I got hungry and woke up.” “Eat some soup,” Bill said.",0
9403,"The three of us sat at the table, and it seemed as though about six people were missing. BOOK III   CHAPTER 19 In the morning it was all over. The fiesta was finished. I woke about nine o’clock, had a bath, dressed, and went down-stairs. The square was empty and there were no people on the streets. A few children were picking up rocket-sticks in the square. The cafés were just opening and the waiters were carrying out the comfortable white wicker chairs and arranging them around the marble-topped tables in the shade of the arcade. They were sweeping the streets and sprinkling them with a hose.",0
9404,"I sat in one of the wicker chairs and leaned back comfortably. The waiter was in no hurry to come. The white-paper announcements of the unloading of the bulls and the big schedules of special trains were still up on the pillars of the arcade. A waiter wearing a blue apron came out with a bucket of water and a cloth, and commenced to tear down the notices, pulling the paper off in strips and washing and rubbing away the paper that stuck to the stone. The fiesta was over.",0
9405,I drank a coffee and after a while Bill came over. I watched him come walking across the square. He sat down at the table and ordered a coffee.,0
9406,"“Well,” he said, “it’s all over.” “Yes,” I said. “When do you go?”  “I don’t know.",0
9407,"We better get a car, I think. Aren’t you going back to Paris?”  “No. I can stay away another week. I think I’ll go to San Sebastian.”",0
9408,“I want to get back.” “What’s Mike going to do?”  “He’s going to Saint Jean de Luz.”  “Let’s get a car and all go as far as Bayonne. You can get the train up from there to-night.”,0
9409,“Good. Let’s go after lunch.” “All right. I’ll get the car.”,0
9410,"We had lunch and paid the bill. Montoya did not come near us. One of the maids brought the bill. The car was outside. The chauffeur piled and strapped the bags on top of the car and put them in beside him in the front seat and we got in. The car went out of the square, along through the side streets, out under the trees and down the hill and away from Pamplona. It did not seem like a very long ride. Mike had a bottle of Fundador. I only took a couple of drinks. We came over the mountains and out of Spain and down the white roads and through the overfoliaged, wet, green, Basque country, and finally into Bayonne. We left Bill’s baggage at the station, and he bought a ticket to Paris. His train left at seven-ten. We came out of the station. The car was standing out in front.",0
9411,"“What shall we do about the car?” Bill asked. “Oh, bother the car,” Mike said. “Let’s just keep the car with us.”",0
9412,"“All right,” Bill said. “Where shall we go?”  “Let’s go to Biarritz and have a drink.” “Old Mike the spender,” Bill said.",0
9413,"We drove in to Biarritz and left the car outside a very Ritz place. We went into the bar and sat on high stools and drank a whiskey and soda. “That drink’s mine,” Mike said.",0
9414,"“Let’s roll for it.” So we rolled poker dice out of a deep leather dice-cup. Bill was out first roll. Mike lost to me and handed the bartender a hundred-franc note. The whiskeys were twelve francs apiece. We had another round and Mike lost again. Each time he gave the bartender a good tip. In a room off the bar there was a good jazz band playing. It was a pleasant bar. We had another round. I went out on the first roll with four kings. Bill and Mike rolled. Mike won the first roll with four jacks. Bill won the second. On the final roll Mike had three kings and let them stay. He handed the dice-cup to Bill. Bill rattled them and rolled, and there were three kings, an ace, and a queen.",0
9415,"“It’s yours, Mike,” Bill said. “Old Mike, the gambler.”  “I’m so sorry,” Mike said. “I can’t get it.”",0
9416,"“What’s the matter?”  “I’ve no money,” Mike said. “I’m stony. I’ve just twenty francs. Here, take twenty francs.”",0
9417,"Bill’s face sort of changed. “I just had enough to pay Montoya. Damned lucky to have it, too.”  “I’ll cash you a check,” Bill said.",0
9418,"“That’s damned nice of you, but you see I can’t write checks.” “What are you going to do for money?”  “Oh, some will come through. I’ve two weeks allowance should be here. I can live on tick at this pub in Saint Jean.”",0
9419,“What do you want to do about the car?” Bill asked me. “Do you want to keep it on?”  “It doesn’t make any difference.,0
9420,"Seems sort of idiotic.”  “Come on, let’s have another drink,” Mike said. “Fine. This one is on me,” Bill said. “Has Brett any money?” He turned to Mike.",0
9421,“I shouldn’t think so. She put up most of what I gave to old Montoya.” “She hasn’t any money with her?” I asked.,0
9422,“I shouldn’t think so. She never has any money. She gets five hundred quid a year and pays three hundred and fifty of it in interest to Jews.”,0
9423,"“I suppose they get it at the source,” said Bill. “Quite. They’re not really Jews. We just call them Jews. They’re Scotsmen, I believe.”  “Hasn’t she any at all with her?”",0
9424,I asked. “I hardly think so. She gave it all to me when she left.”,0
9425,"“Well,” Bill said, “we might as well have another drink.”  “Damned good idea,” Mike said. “One never gets anywhere by discussing finances.” “No,” said Bill. Bill and I rolled for the next two rounds. Bill lost and paid. We went out to the car.",0
9426,"“Anywhere you’d like to go, Mike?” Bill asked. “Let’s take a drive. It might do my credit good. Let’s drive about a little.”  “Fine.",0
9427,I’d like to see the coast. Let’s drive down toward Hendaye.” “I haven’t any credit along the coast.”,0
9428,"“You can’t ever tell,” said Bill. We drove out along the coast road. There was the green of the headlands, the white, red-roofed villas, patches of forest, and the ocean very blue with the tide out and the water curling far out along the beach. We drove through Saint Jean de Luz and passed through villages farther down the coast. Back of the rolling country we were going through we saw the mountains we had come over from Pamplona. The road went on ahead. Bill looked at his watch. It was time for us to go back. He knocked on the glass and told the driver to turn around. The driver backed the car out into the grass to turn it. In back of us were the woods, below a stretch of meadow, then the sea.",0
9429,At the hotel where Mike was going to stay in Saint Jean we stopped the car and he got out. The chauffeur carried in his bags. Mike stood by the side of the car.,0
9430,"“Good-bye, you chaps,” Mike said. “It was a damned fine fiesta.” “So long, Mike,” Bill said.",0
9431,"“I’ll see you around,” I said. “Don’t worry about money,” Mike said. “You can pay for the car, Jake, and I’ll send you my share.”",0
9432,"“So long, Mike.”  “So long, you chaps. You’ve been damned nice.” We all shook hands. We waved from the car to Mike. He stood in the road watching. We got to Bayonne just before the train left. A porter carried Bill’s bags in from the consigne. I went as far as the inner gate to the tracks.",0
9433,"“So long, fella,” Bill said. “So long, kid!” “It was swell. I’ve had a swell time.”",0
9434,"“Will you be in Paris?”  “No, I have to sail on the 17th. So long, fella!”  “So long, old kid!”  He went in through the gate to the train. The porter went ahead with the bags. I watched the train pull out. Bill was at one of the windows. The window passed, the rest of the train passed, and the tracks were empty. I went outside to the car.",0
9435,“How much do we owe you?” I asked the driver. The price to Bayonne had been fixed at a hundred and fifty pesetas.,0
9436,"“Two hundred pesetas.”  “How much more will it be if you drive me to San Sebastian on your way back?”  “Fifty pesetas.”  “Don’t kid me.” “Thirty-five pesetas.”  “It’s not worth it,” I said. “Drive me to the Hotel Panier Fleuri.”",0
9437,"At the hotel I paid the driver and gave him a tip. The car was powdered with dust. I rubbed the rod-case through the dust. It seemed the last thing that connected me with Spain and the fiesta. The driver put the car in gear and went down the street. I watched it turn off to take the road to Spain. I went into the hotel and they gave me a room. It was the same room I had slept in when Bill and Cohn and I were in Bayonne. That seemed a very long time ago. I washed, changed my shirt, and went out in the town.",0
9438,"At a newspaper kiosque I bought a copy of the New York Herald and sat in a café to read it. It felt strange to be in France again. There was a safe, suburban feeling. I wished I had gone up to Paris with Bill, except that Paris would have meant more fiesta-ing. I was through with fiestas for a while. It would be quiet in San Sebastian. The season does not open there until August. I could get a good hotel room and read and swim. There was a fine beach there. There were wonderful trees along the promenade above the beach, and there were many children sent down with their nurses before the season opened. In the evening there would be band concerts under the trees across from the Café Marinas. I could sit in the Marinas and listen.",0
9439,“How does one eat inside?” I asked the waiter. Inside the café was a restaurant.,0
9440,“Well. Very well. One eats very well.”  “Good.”,0
9441,I went in and ate dinner. It was a big meal for France but it seemed very carefully apportioned after Spain. I drank a bottle of wine for company. It was a Château Margaux. It was pleasant to be drinking slowly and to be tasting the wine and to be drinking alone. A bottle of wine was good company. Afterward I had coffee. The waiter recommended a Basque liqueur called Izzarra. He brought in the bottle and poured a liqueur-glass full. He said Izzarra was made of the flowers of the Pyrenees. The veritable flowers of the Pyrenees. It looked like hair-oil and smelled like Italian strega. I told him to take the flowers of the Pyrenees away and bring me a vieux marc. The marc was good. I had a second marc after the coffee.,0
9442,"The waiter seemed a little offended about the flowers of the Pyrenees, so I overtipped him. That made him happy. It felt comfortable to be in a country where it is so simple to make people happy. You can never tell whether a Spanish waiter will thank you. Everything is on such a clear financial basis in France. It is the simplest country to live in. No one makes things complicated by becoming your friend for any obscure reason. If you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money. I spent a little money and the waiter liked me. He appreciated my valuable qualities. He would be glad to see me back. I would dine there again some time and he would be glad to see me, and would want me at his table. It would be a sincere liking because it would have a sound basis. I was back in France.",0
9443,"Next morning I tipped every one a little too much at the hotel to make more friends, and left on the morning train for San Sebastian. At the station I did not tip the porter more than I should because I did not think I would ever see him again. I only wanted a few good French friends in Bayonne to make me welcome in case I should come back there again. I knew that if they remembered me their friendship would be loyal.",0
9444,"At Irun we had to change trains and show passports. I hated to leave France. Life was so simple in France. I felt I was a fool to be going back into Spain. In Spain you could not tell about anything. I felt like a fool to be going back into it, but I stood in line with my passport, opened my bags for the customs, bought a ticket, went through a gate, climbed onto the train, and after forty minutes and eight tunnels I was at San Sebastian.",0
9445,"Even on a hot day San Sebastian has a certain early-morning quality. The trees seem as though their leaves were never quite dry. The streets feel as though they had just been sprinkled. It is always cool and shady on certain streets on the hottest day. I went to a hotel in the town where I had stopped before, and they gave me a room with a balcony that opened out above the roofs of the town. There was a green mountainside beyond the roofs.",0
9446,"I unpacked my bags and stacked my books on the table beside the head of the bed, put out my shaving things, hung up some clothes in the big armoire, and made up a bundle for the laundry. Then I took a shower in the bathroom and went down to lunch. Spain had not changed to summer-time, so I was early. I set my watch again. I had recovered an hour by coming to San Sebastian.",0
9447,"As I went into the dining-room the concierge brought me a police bulletin to fill out. I signed it and asked him for two telegraph forms, and wrote a message to the Hotel Montoya, telling them to forward all mail and telegrams for me to this address. I calculated how many days I would be in San Sebastian and then wrote out a wire to the office asking them to hold mail, but forward all wires for me to San Sebastian for six days. Then I went in and had lunch.",0
9448,"After lunch I went up to my room, read a while, and went to sleep. When I woke it was half past four. I found my swimming-suit, wrapped it with a comb in a towel, and went down-stairs and walked up the street to the Concha. The tide was about half-way out. The beach was smooth and firm, and the sand yellow. I went into a bathing-cabin, undressed, put on my suit, and walked across the smooth sand to the sea. The sand was warm under bare feet. There were quite a few people in the water and on the beach. Out beyond where the headlands of the Concha almost met to form the harbor there was a white line of breakers and the open sea. Although the tide was going out, there were a few slow rollers. They came in like undulations in the water, gathered weight of water, and then broke smoothly on the warm sand. I waded out. The water was cold. As a roller came I dove, swam out under water, and came to the surface with all the chill gone. I swam out to the raft, pulled myself up, and lay on the hot planks. A boy and girl were at the other end. The girl had undone the top strap of her bathing-suit and was browning her back. The boy lay face downward on the raft and talked to her. She laughed at things he said, and turned her brown back in the sun. I lay on the raft in the sun until I was dry. Then I tried several dives. I dove deep once, swimming down to the bottom. I swam with my eyes open and it was green and dark. The raft made a dark shadow. I came out of water beside the raft, pulled up, dove once more, holding it for length, and then swam ashore. I lay on the beach until I was dry, then went into the bathing-cabin, took off my suit, sloshed myself with fresh water, and rubbed dry.",0
9449,"I walked around the harbor under the trees to the casino, and then up one of the cool streets to the Café Marinas. There was an orchestra playing inside the café and I sat out on the terrace and enjoyed the fresh coolness in the hot day, and had a glass of lemon-juice and shaved ice and then a long whiskey and soda. I sat in front of the Marinas for a long time and read and watched the people, and listened to the music.",0
9450,"Later when it began to get dark, I walked around the harbor and out along the promenade, and finally back to the hotel for supper. There was a bicycle-race on, the Tour du Pays Basque, and the riders were stopping that night in San Sebastian. In the dining-room, at one side, there was a long table of bicycle-riders, eating with their trainers and managers. They were all French and Belgians, and paid close attention to their meal, but they were having a good time. At the head of the table were two good-looking French girls, with much Rue du Faubourg Montmartre chic. I could not make out whom they belonged to. They all spoke in slang at the long table and there were many private jokes and some jokes at the far end that were not repeated when the girls asked to hear them. The next morning at five o’clock the race resumed with the last lap, San Sebastian-Bilbao. The bicycle-riders drank much wine, and were burned and browned by the sun. They did not take the race seriously except among themselves. They had raced among themselves so often that it did not make much difference who won. Especially in a foreign country. The money could be arranged.",0
9451,"The man who had a matter of two minutes lead in the race had an attack of boils, which were very painful. He sat on the small of his back. His neck was very red and the blond hairs were sunburned. The other riders joked him about his boils. He tapped on the table with his fork.",0
9452,"“Listen,” he said, “to-morrow my nose is so tight on the handle-bars that the only thing touches those boils is a lovely breeze.”  One of the girls looked at him down the table, and he grinned and turned red. The Spaniards, they said, did not know how to pedal. I had coffee out on the terrasse with the team manager of one of the big bicycle manufacturers. He said it had been a very pleasant race, and would have been worth watching if Bottechia had not abandoned it at Pamplona. The dust had been bad, but in Spain the roads were better than in France. Bicycle road-racing was the only sport in the world, he said. Had I ever followed the Tour de France? Only in the papers. The Tour de France was the greatest sporting event in the world. Following and organizing the road races had made him know France. Few people know France. All spring and all summer and all fall he spent on the road with bicycle road-racers. Look at the number of motor-cars now that followed the riders from town to town in a road race. It was a rich country and more sportif every year. It would be the most sportif country in the world. It was bicycle road-racing did it. That and football. He knew France. La France Sportive. He knew road-racing. We had a cognac. After all, though, it wasn’t bad to get back to Paris. There is only one Paname. In all the world, that is. Paris is the town the most sportif in the world. Did I know the Chope de Negre? Did I not. I would see him there some time. I certainly would. We would drink another fine together. We certainly would. They started at six o’clock less a quarter in the morning. Would I be up for the depart? I would certainly try to. Would I like him to call me? It was very interesting. I would leave a call at the desk. He would not mind calling me. I could not let him take the trouble. I would leave a call at the desk. We said good-bye until the next morning.",0
9453,In the morning when I awoke the bicycle-riders and their following cars had been on the road for three hours. I had coffee and the papers in bed and then dressed and took my bathing-suit down to the beach. Everything was fresh and cool and damp in the early morning. Nurses in uniform and in peasant costume walked under the trees with children. The Spanish children were beautiful. Some bootblacks sat together under a tree talking to a soldier. The soldier had only one arm. The tide was in and there was a good breeze and a surf on the beach.,0
9454,"I undressed in one of the bath-cabins, crossed the narrow line of beach and went into the water. I swam out, trying to swim through the rollers, but having to dive sometimes. Then in the quiet water I turned and floated. Floating I saw only the sky, and felt the drop and lift of the swells. I swam back to the surf and coasted in, face down, on a big roller, then turned and swam, trying to keep in the trough and not have a wave break over me. It made me tired, swimming in the trough, and I turned and swam out to the raft. The water was buoyant and cold. It felt as though you could never sink. I swam slowly, it seemed like a long swim with the high tide, and then pulled up on the raft and sat, dripping, on the boards that were becoming hot in the sun. I looked around at the bay, the old town, the casino, the line of trees along the promenade, and the big hotels with their white porches and gold-lettered names. Off on the right, almost closing the harbor, was a green hill with a castle. The raft rocked with the motion of the water. On the other side of the narrow gap that led into the open sea was another high headland. I thought I would like to swim across the bay but I was afraid of cramp.",0
9455,"I sat in the sun and watched the bathers on the beach. They looked very small. After a while I stood up, gripped with my toes on the edge of the raft as it tipped with my weight, and dove cleanly and deeply, to come up through the lightening water, blew the salt water out of my head, and swam slowly and steadily in to shore.",0
9456,"After I was dressed and had paid for the bath-cabin, I walked back to the hotel. The bicycle-racers had left several copies of L’Auto around, and I gathered them up in the reading-room and took them out and sat in an easy chair in the sun to read about and catch up on French sporting life. While I was sitting there the concierge came out with a blue envelope in his hand.",0
9457,"“A telegram for you, sir.” I poked my finger along under the fold that was fastened down, spread it open, and read it. It had been forwarded from Paris:  COULD YOU COME HOTEL MONTANA MADRID  AM RATHER IN TROUBLE BRETT.",0
9458,I tipped the concierge and read the message again. A postman was coming along the sidewalk. He turned in the hotel. He had a big moustache and looked very military. He came out of the hotel again. The concierge was just behind him.,0
9459,"“Here’s another telegram for you, sir.”  “Thank you,” I said. I opened it. It was forwarded from Pamplona.",0
9460,"COULD YOU COME HOTEL MONTANA MADRID  AM RATHER IN TROUBLE BRETT. The concierge stood there waiting for another tip, probably. “What time is there a train for Madrid?”  “It left at nine this morning.",0
9461,"There is a slow train at eleven, and the Sud Express at ten to-night.” “Get me a berth on the Sud Express. Do you want the money now?”  “Just as you wish,” he said.",0
9462,"“I will have it put on the bill.” “Do that.” Well, that meant San Sebastian all shot to hell. I suppose, vaguely, I had expected something of the sort. I saw the concierge standing in the doorway.",0
9463,"“Bring me a telegram form, please.” He brought it and I took out my fountain-pen and printed:  LADY ASHLEY HOTEL MONTANA MADRID  ARRIVING SUD EXPRESS TOMORROW LOVE  JAKE. That seemed to handle it. That was it. Send a girl off with one man. Introduce her to another to go off with him. Now go and bring her back. And sign the wire with love. That was it all right. I went in to lunch.",0
9464,"I did not sleep much that night on the Sud Express. In the morning I had breakfast in the dining-car and watched the rock and pine country between Avila and Escorial. I saw the Escorial out of the window, gray and long and cold in the sun, and did not give a damn about it. I saw Madrid come up over the plain, a compact white sky-line on the top of a little cliff away off across the sun-hardened country.",0
9465,"The Norte station in Madrid is the end of the line. All trains finish there. They don’t go on anywhere. Outside were cabs and taxis and a line of hotel runners. It was like a country town. I took a taxi and we climbed up through the gardens, by the empty palace and the unfinished church on the edge of the cliff, and on up until we were in the high, hot, modern town. The taxi coasted down a smooth street to the Puerta del Sol, and then through the traffic and out into the Carrera San Jeronimo. All the shops had their awnings down against the heat. The windows on the sunny side of the street were shuttered. The taxi stopped at the curb. I saw the sign HOTEL MONTANA on the second floor. The taxi-driver carried the bags in and left them by the elevator. I could not make the elevator work, so I walked up. On the second floor up was a cut brass sign: HOTEL MONTANA. I rang and no one came to the door. I rang again and a maid with a sullen face opened the door.",0
9466,“Is Lady Ashley here?” I asked. She looked at me dully.,0
9467,“Is an Englishwoman here?”  She turned and called some one inside. A very fat woman came to the door. Her hair was gray and stiffly oiled in scallops around her face. She was short and commanding.,0
9468,"“Muy buenos,” I said. “Is there an Englishwoman here? I would like to see this English lady.”",0
9469,"“Muy buenos. Yes, there is a female English. Certainly you can see her if she wishes to see you.”",0
9470,“She wishes to see me.” “The chica will ask her.” “It is very hot.”,0
9471,"“It is very hot in the summer in Madrid.” “And how cold in winter.” “Yes, it is very cold in winter.”",0
9472,"Did I want to stay myself in person in the Hotel Montana? Of that as yet I was undecided, but it would give me pleasure if my bags were brought up from the ground floor in order that they might not be stolen. Nothing was ever stolen in the Hotel Montana. In other fondas, yes. Not here. No. The personages of this establishment were rigidly selectioned. I was happy to hear it. Nevertheless I would welcome the upbringal of my bags.",0
9473,"The maid came in and said that the female English wanted to see the male English now, at once. “Good,” I said. “You see. It is as I said.”  “Clearly.”",0
9474,"I followed the maid’s back down a long, dark corridor. At the end she knocked on a door. “Hello,” said Brett. “Is it you, Jake?”  “It’s me.”  “Come in.",0
9475,Come in.” I opened the door. The maid closed it after me. Brett was in bed. She had just been brushing her hair and held the brush in her hand. The room was in that disorder produced only by those who have always had servants.,0
9476,"“Darling!” Brett said. I went over to the bed and put my arms around her. She kissed me, and while she kissed me I could feel she was thinking of something else. She was trembling in my arms. She felt very small.",0
9477,“Darling! I’ve had such a hell of a time.” “Tell me about it.”,0
9478,“Nothing to tell. He only left yesterday. I made him go.”,0
9479,“Why didn’t you keep him?”  “I don’t know. It isn’t the sort of thing one does. I don’t think I hurt him any.”,0
9480,“You were probably damn good for him.” “He shouldn’t be living with any one. I realized that right away.”  “No.”,0
9481,"“Oh, hell!” she said, “let’s not talk about it. Let’s never talk about it.”",0
9482,"“All right.”  “It was rather a knock his being ashamed of me. He was ashamed of me for a while, you know.”  “No.”  “Oh, yes. They ragged him about me at the café, I guess. He wanted me to grow my hair out. Me, with long hair. I’d look so like hell.”",0
9483,“It’s funny.” “He said it would make me more womanly. I’d look a fright.”,0
9484,"“What happened?”  “Oh, he got over that. He wasn’t ashamed of me long.” “What was it about being in trouble?”  “I didn’t know whether I could make him go, and I didn’t have a sou to go away and leave him.",0
9485,"He tried to give me a lot of money, you know. I told him I had scads of it. He knew that was a lie. I couldn’t take his money, you know.”",0
9486,"“No.”  “Oh, let’s not talk about it. There were some funny things, though. Do give me a cigarette.”",0
9487,"I lit the cigarette. “He learned his English as a waiter in Gib.” “Yes.”  “He wanted to marry me, finally.”",0
9488,“Really?”  “Of course. I can’t even marry Mike.” “Maybe he thought that would make him Lord Ashley.”  “No.,0
9489,"It wasn’t that. He really wanted to marry me. So I couldn’t go away from him, he said. He wanted to make it sure I could never go away from him. After I’d gotten more womanly, of course.”",0
9490,“You ought to feel set up.” “I do. I’m all right again. He’s wiped out that damned Cohn.”  “Good.”,0
9491,“You know I’d have lived with him if I hadn’t seen it was bad for him. We got along damned well.” “Outside of your personal appearance.”,0
9492,"“Oh, he’d have gotten used to that.” She put out the cigarette. “I’m thirty-four, you know. I’m not going to be one of these bitches that ruins children.”",0
9493,"“No.”  “I’m not going to be that way. I feel rather good, you know. I feel rather set up.”  “Good.”",0
9494,She looked away. I thought she was looking for another cigarette. Then I saw she was crying. I could feel her crying. Shaking and crying. She wouldn’t look up. I put my arms around her.,0
9495,“Don’t let’s ever talk about it. Please don’t let’s ever talk about it.” “Dear Brett.”  “I’m going back to Mike.”,0
9496,I could feel her crying as I held her close. “He’s so damned nice and he’s so awful. He’s my sort of thing.”,0
9497,She would not look up. I stroked her hair. I could feel her shaking.,0
9498,"“I won’t be one of those bitches,” she said. “But, oh, Jake, please let’s never talk about it.” We left the Hotel Montana. The woman who ran the hotel would not let me pay the bill. The bill had been paid.",0
9499,"“Oh, well. Let it go,” Brett said. “It doesn’t matter now.”",0
9500,"We rode in a taxi down to the Palace Hotel, left the bags, arranged for berths on the Sud Express for the night, and went into the bar of the hotel for a cocktail. We sat on high stools at the bar while the barman shook the Martinis in a large nickelled shaker. “It’s funny what a wonderful gentility you get in the bar of a big hotel,” I said.",0
9501,"“Barmen and jockeys are the only people who are polite any more.” “No matter how vulgar a hotel is, the bar is always nice.” “It’s odd.”  “Bartenders have always been fine.”  “You know,” Brett said, “it’s quite true.",0
9502,He is only nineteen. Isn’t it amazing?”  We touched the two glasses as they stood side by side on the bar. They were coldly beaded. Outside the curtained window was the summer heat of Madrid.,0
9503,"“I like an olive in a Martini,” I said to the barman. “Right you are, sir. There you are.”",0
9504,"“Thanks.”  “I should have asked, you know.” The barman went far enough up the bar so that he would not hear our conversation. Brett had sipped from the Martini as it stood, on the wood. Then she picked it up. Her hand was steady enough to lift it after that first sip.",0
9505,"“It’s good. Isn’t it a nice bar?”  “They’re all nice bars.” “You know I didn’t believe it at first. He was born in 1905. I was in school in Paris, then. Think of that.”",0
9506,"“Anything you want me to think about it?”  “Don’t be an ass. Would you buy a lady a drink?”  “We’ll have two more Martinis.” “As they were before, sir?”  “They were very good.”",0
9507,"Brett smiled at him. “Thank you, ma’am.” “Well, bung-o,” Brett said.",0
9508,"“Bung-o!”  “You know,” Brett said, “he’d only been with two women before. He never cared about anything but bull-fighting.” “He’s got plenty of time.”",0
9509,“I don’t know. He thinks it was me. Not the show in general.”,0
9510,"“Well, it was you.” “Yes. It was me.”",0
9511,"“I thought you weren’t going to ever talk about it.” “How can I help it?”  “You’ll lose it if you talk about it.” “I just talk around it. You know I feel rather damned good, Jake.”  “You should.”",0
9512,"“You know it makes one feel rather good deciding not to be a bitch.” “Yes.”  “It’s sort of what we have instead of God.” “Some people have God,” I said. “Quite a lot.”  “He never worked very well with me.”",0
9513,“Should we have another Martini?” The barman shook up two more Martinis and poured them out into fresh glasses. “Where will we have lunch?” I asked Brett. The bar was cool. You could feel the heat outside through the window.,0
9514,“Here?” asked Brett. “It’s rotten here in the hotel. Do you know a place called Botin’s?” I asked the barman.,0
9515,"“Yes, sir. Would you like to have me write out the address?”  “Thank you.” We lunched up-stairs at Botin’s. It is one of the best restaurants in the world. We had roast young suckling pig and drank rioja alta. Brett did not eat much. She never ate much. I ate a very big meal and drank three bottles of rioja alta.",0
9516,"“How do you feel, Jake?” Brett asked. “My God! what a meal you’ve eaten.”",0
9517,"“I feel fine. Do you want a dessert?”  “Lord, no.”  Brett was smoking. “You like to eat, don’t you?” she said.",0
9518,“Yes.” I said. “I like to do a lot of things.”,0
9519,"“What do you like to do?”  “Oh,” I said, “I like to do a lot of things. Don’t you want a dessert?”  “You asked me that once,” Brett said. “Yes,” I said. “So I did. Let’s have another bottle of rioja alta.”",0
9520,"“It’s very good.” “You haven’t drunk much of it,” I said. “I have. You haven’t seen.”  “Let’s get two bottles,” I said.",0
9521,"The bottles came. I poured a little in my glass, then a glass for Brett, then filled my glass. We touched glasses.",0
9522,“Bung-o!” Brett said. I drank my glass and poured out another. Brett put her hand on my arm.,0
9523,"“Don’t get drunk, Jake,” she said. “You don’t have to.” “How do you know?”  “Don’t,” she said.",0
9524,"“You’ll be all right.” “I’m not getting drunk,” I said. “I’m just drinking a little wine. I like to drink wine.”  “Don’t get drunk,” she said.",0
9525,"“Jake, don’t get drunk.” “Want to go for a ride?” I said. “Want to ride through the town?”  “Right,” Brett said.",0
9526,"“I haven’t seen Madrid. I should see Madrid.” “I’ll finish this,” I said.",0
9527,"Down-stairs we came out through the first-floor dining-room to the street. A waiter went for a taxi. It was hot and bright. Up the street was a little square with trees and grass where there were taxis parked. A taxi came up the street, the waiter hanging out at the side. I tipped him and told the driver where to drive, and got in beside Brett. The driver started up the street. I settled back. Brett moved close to me. We sat close against each other. I put my arm around her and she rested against me comfortably. It was very hot and bright, and the houses looked sharply white. We turned out onto the Gran Via.",0
9528,"“Oh, Jake,” Brett said, “we could have had such a damned good time together.” Ahead was a mounted policeman in khaki directing traffic. He raised his baton. The car slowed suddenly pressing Brett against me.",0
9529,"“Yes,” I said. “Isn’t it pretty to think so?”",0
